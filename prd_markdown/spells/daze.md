**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of wool or similar substance)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

This spell clouds the mind of a humanoid creature with 4 or fewer Hit Dice so that it takes no actions. Humanoids of 5 or more HD are not affected. A [dazed](../glossary#_dazed) subject is not [stunned](../glossary#_stunned), so attackers get no special advantage against it. After a creature has been [dazed](../glossary#_dazed) by this spell, it is immune to the effects of this spell for 1 minute.
