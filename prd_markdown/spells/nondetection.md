The warded creature or object becomes difficult to detect by divination spells such as _ [clairaudience/clairvoyance](clairaudienceClairvoyance#_clairaudience-clairvoyance), [locate object](locateObject#_locate-object), _and _detect _spells. _Nondetection _also prevents location by such magic items as _crystal ball_s. If a divination is attempted against the warded creature or item, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the spellcaster who cast _nondetection_. If you cast _nondetection _on yourself or on an item currently in your possession, the DC is 15 + your caster level.

If cast on a creature, _nondetection _wards the creature's gear as well as the creature itself.
