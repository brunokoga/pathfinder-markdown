A brilliant divine radiance surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by evil creatures, and causing evil creatures to become [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded) when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class) and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _ [protection from evil](protectionFromEvil.md#_protection-from-evil)_, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance) 25 against evil spells and spells cast by evil creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects the recipient from possession and mental influence, just as _ [protection from evil](protectionFromEvil.md#_protection-from-evil) _does.

Finally, if an evil creature succeeds on a melee attack against a creature warded by a _holy aura_, the offending attacker is [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded) ( [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save negates, as _ [blindness/deafness](blindnessDeafness.md#_blindness-deafness)_, but against _holy aura's _save DC).
