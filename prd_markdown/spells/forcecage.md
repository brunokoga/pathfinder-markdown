This spell creates an immobile, invisible cubical prison composed of either bars of force or solid walls of force (your choice).

Creatures within the area are caught and contained unless they are too big to fit inside, in which case the spell automatically fails. Teleportation and other forms of astral travel provide a means of escape, but the force walls or bars extend into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.

Like a _ [wall of force](wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force)_, a _forcecage_ resists _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic), _although a _ [mage's disjunction](mageSDisjunction.md#_mage-s-disjunction)_ still functions_. _The walls of a _forcecage _can be damaged by spells as normal, except for _ [disintegrate](disintegrate.md#_disintegrate), _which automatically destroys it. The walls of a _forcecage_ can be damaged by weapons and supernatural abilities, but they have a Hardness of 30 and a number of hit points equal to 20 per caster level. Contact with a _ [sphere of annihilation](../magicItems/artifacts.md#_sphere-of-annihilation) _or _ [rod of cancellation](../magicItems/rods.md#_rod-of-cancellation)_ instantly destroys a _forcecage._

_Barred Cage_: This version of the spell produces a 20-foot cube made of bands of force (similar to a _ [wall of force](wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force) _spell) for bars. The bands are a half-inch wide, with half-inch gaps between them. Any creature capable of passing through such a small space can escape; others are confined within the barred cage. You can't attack a creature in a barred cage with a weapon unless the weapon can fit between the gaps. Even against such weapons (including arrows and similar ranged attacks), a creature in the barred cage has cover. All spells and breath weapons can pass through the gaps in the bars.

_Windowless Cell_: This version of the spell produces a 10-foot cube with no way in and no way out. Solid walls of force form its six sides.
