You create a phantasmal image of the most fearsome creature imaginable to the subject simply by forming the fears of the subject's subconscious mind into something that its conscious mind can visualize: this most horrible beast. Only the spell's subject can see the _phantasmal killer_. You see only a vague shape. The target first gets a [Will](../combat.md#_will) save to recognize the image as unreal. If that save fails, the phantasm touches the subject, and the subject must succeed on a [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save or die from fear. Even if the [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save is successful, the subject takes 3d6 points of damage.

If the subject of a _phantasmal killer _attack succeeds in disbelieving and possesses telepathy or is wearing a _helm of telepathy, _the beast can be turned upon you. You must then disbelieve it or become subject to its deadly fear attack.
