The subject's outline appears blurred, shifting, and wavering. This distortion grants the subject concealment (20% miss chance).

A _ [see invisibility](seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility) _spell does not counteract the _blur _effect, but a _ [true seeing](trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing) _spell does.

Opponents that cannot see the subject ignore the spell's effect (though fighting an unseen opponent carries penalties of its own).
