You trace mystic runes upon a book, map, scroll, or similar object bearing written information. The _explosive runes _detonate when read, dealing 6d6 points of force damage. Anyone next to the _explosive runes _(close enough to read them) takes the full damage with no saving throw; any other creature within 10 feet of the _explosive runes _is entitled to a [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) save for half damage. The object on which the _explosive runes _were written also takes full damage (no saving throw).

You and any characters you specifically instruct can read the protected writing without triggering the _explosive runes. _Likewise, you can remove the _explosive runes _whenever desired. Another creature can remove them with a successful _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic) _or _erase _spell, but attempting to dispel or erase the _explosive runes _and failing to do so triggers the explosion.

Magic traps such as _explosive runes _are hard to detect and disable. A character with the trapfinding class feature (only) can use Disable Device to thwart _explosive runes_. The DC to find magic traps using Perception and to disable them is 25 + spell level, or 28 for _explosive runes_.
