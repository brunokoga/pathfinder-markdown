You write instructions or other information on parchment, paper, or any suitable writing material. The _illusory script _appears to be some form of foreign or magical writing. Only the person (or people) designated by you at the time of the casting can read the writing; it's unintelligible to any other character_._

Any unauthorized creature attempting to read the script triggers a potent illusory effect and must make a saving throw. A successful saving throw means the creature can look away with only a mild sense of disorientation. Failure means the creature is subject to a _ [suggestion](suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ implanted in the script by you at the time the _illusory script_ spell was cast. The _ [suggestion](suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ lasts only 30 minutes. Typical _suggestions_ include “Close the book and leave,” “Forget the existence of this note,” and so forth. If successfully dispelled by _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic), _the _illusory script _and its secret message disappear. The hidden message can be read by a combination of the _ [true seeing](trueSeeing.md#_true-seeing) _spell with the _ [read magic](readMagic.md#_read-magic) _or _ [comprehend languages](comprehendLanguages.md#_comprehend-languages) _spell.
