**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Components** V, S, M (a _potion of [bull's strength](bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_, which you drink and whose effects are subsumed by the spell effects)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You become a fighting machineâ€”stronger, tougher, faster, and more skilled in combat. Your mindset changes so that you relish combat and you can't cast spells, even from magic items.

You gain a +4 enhancement bonus to [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength), [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.md#_dexterity), and [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution), a +4 natural armor bonus to [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class), a +5 competence bonus on [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) saves, and proficiency with all simple and martial weapons. Your base attack bonus equals your character level (which may give you multiple attacks).

You lose your spellcasting ability, including your ability to use spell activation or spell completion magic items, just as if the spells were no longer on your class list.
