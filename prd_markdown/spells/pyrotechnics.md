_Pyrotechnics _turns a fire into a burst of blinding fireworks or a thick cloud of choking smoke, depending on your choice. The spell uses one fire source, which is immediately extinguished. A fire so large that it exceeds a 20-foot cube is only partly extinguished. Magical fires are not extinguished, although a fire-based creature used as a source takes 1 point of damage per caster level.

_Fireworks_: The fireworks are a flashing, fiery, momentary burst of glowing, colored aerial lights. This effect causes creatures within 120 feet of the fire source to become [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) for 1d4+1 rounds ( [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates). These creatures must have line of sight to the fire to be affected. [Spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) can prevent blindness.

_Smoke Cloud_: A stream of smoke billows out from the fire, forming a choking cloud that spreads 20 feet in all directions and lasts for 1 round per caster level. All sight, even [darkvision](../glossary.html#_darkvision), is ineffective in or through the cloud. All within the cloud take –4 penalties to [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) and [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) ( [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates). These effects last for 1d4+1 rounds after the cloud dissipates or after the creature leaves the area of the cloud. [Spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) does not apply.
