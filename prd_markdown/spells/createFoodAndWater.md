The food that this spell creates is simple fare of your choiceâ€”highly nourishing, if rather bland. Food so created decays and becomes inedible after 24 hours, although it can be kept fresh for another 24 hours by casting a _purify food and water _spell on it. The water created by this spell is just like clean rain water, and it doesn't go bad as the food does.
