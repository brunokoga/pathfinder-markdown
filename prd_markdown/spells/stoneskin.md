The warded creature gains resistance to blows, cuts, stabs, and slashes. The subject gains [DR](../glossary#_damage-reduction) 10/adamantine. It ignores the first 10 points of damage each time it takes damage from a weapon, though an adamantine weapon bypasses the reduction. Once the spell has prevented a total of 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 150 points), it is discharged.
