 **Stone to Flesh**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of blood mixed with earth)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one [petrified](../glossary.md#_petrified) creature or a cylinder of stone from 1 ft. to 3 ft. in diameter and up to 10 ft. long

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) negates (object); see text; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell restores a [petrified](../glossary.md#_petrified) creature to its normal state, restoring life and goods. The creature must make a DC 15 [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save to survive the process. Any [petrified](../glossary.md#_petrified) creature, regardless of size, can be restored. The spell also can convert a mass of stone into a fleshy substance. Such flesh is inert and lacking a vital life force unless a life force or magical energy is available. For example, this spell would turn an animated stone statue into an animated flesh statue, but an ordinary statue would become a mass of inert flesh in the shape of the statue. You can affect an object that fits within a cylinder from 1 foot to 3 feet in diameter and up to 10 feet long or a cylinder of up to those dimensions in a larger mass of stone.
