This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, except that all creatures within 60 feet of a _symbol of stunning _instead become [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1d6 rounds.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of stunning _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of stunning_.
