 **Bear's Endurance**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a few hairs, or a pinch of dung, from a bear)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

The affected creature gains greater vitality and stamina. The spell grants the subject a +4 enhancement bonus to [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution), which adds the usual benefits to hit points, [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) saves, [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution) checks, and so forth. Hit points gained by a temporary increase in [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution) score are not temporary hit points. They go away when the subject's [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution) drops back to normal. They are not lost first as temporary hit points are.
