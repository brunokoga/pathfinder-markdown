_Erase _removes writings of either magical or mundane nature from a scroll or from one or two pages of paper, parchment, or similar surfaces. With this spell, you can remove _ [explosive runes](explosiveRunes.md#_explosive-runes), _a _ [glyph of warding](glyphOfWarding.md#_glyph-of-warding), _a _ [sepia snake sigil](sepiaSnakeSigil.md#_sepia-snake-sigil), _or an _ [arcane mark](arcaneMark.md#_arcane-mark)_, but not _ [illusory script](illusoryScript.md#_illusory-script) _or a _symbol _spell. Nonmagical writing is automatically erased if you touch it and no one else is holding it. Otherwise, the chance of erasing nonmagical writing is 90%.

Magic writing must be touched to be erased, and you also must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against DC 15. A natural 1 is always a failure on this check. If you fail to erase _ [explosive runes](explosiveRunes.md#_explosive-runes)_, a _ [glyph of warding](glyphOfWarding.md#_glyph-of-warding)_, or a _ [sepia snake sigil](sepiaSnakeSigil.md#_sepia-snake-sigil)_, you accidentally activate that writing instead.
