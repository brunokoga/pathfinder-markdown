This spell enables you or a creature you touch to move and attack normally for the duration of the spell, even under the influence of magic that usually impedes movement, such as paralysis, _ [solid fog](solidFog.html#_solid-fog)_, _ [slow](slow.html#_slow)_, and _ [web](web.html#_web)_. All combat maneuver checks made to grapple the target automatically fail. The subject automatically succeeds on any combat maneuver checks and Escape Artist checks made to escape a grapple or a pin.

The spell also allows the subject to move and attack normally while underwater, even with slashing weapons such as axes and swords or with bludgeoning weapons such as flails, hammers, and maces, provided that the weapon is wielded in the hand rather than hurled. The _freedom of movement _spell does not, however, grant [water breathing](waterBreathing.html#_water-breathing).
