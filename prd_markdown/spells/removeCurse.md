_Remove curse _can remove all curses on an object or a creature. If the target is a creature, you must make a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against the DC of each curse affecting the target. Success means that the curse is removed. _Remove curse _does not remove the curse from a cursed shield, weapon, or suit of armor, although a successful caster level check enables the creature afflicted with any such cursed item to remove and get rid of it.

_Remove curse_ counters and dispels _ [bestow curse](bestowCurse#_bestow-curse)_.
