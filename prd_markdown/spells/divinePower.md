Calling upon the divine power of your patron, you imbue yourself with strength and skill in combat. You gain a +1 luck bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength) checks, and [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength)-based skill checks for every three caster levels you have (maximum +6). You also gain 1 temporary hit point per caster level. Whenever you make a full-attack action, you can make an additional attack at your full base attack bonus, plus any appropriate modifiers. This additional attack is not cumulative with similar effects, such as _ [haste](haste.md#_haste)_ or weapons with the _speed_ special ability.
