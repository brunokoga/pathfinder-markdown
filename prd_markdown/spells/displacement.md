The subject of this spell appears to be about 2 feet away from its true location. The creature benefits from a 50% miss chance as if it had total concealment. Unlike actual total concealment, _displacement _does not prevent enemies from targeting the creature normally. _ [True seeing](trueSeeing#_true-seeing) _reveals its true location and negates the miss chance.
