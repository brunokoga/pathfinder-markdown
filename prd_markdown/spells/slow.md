An affected creature moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. Creatures affected by this spell are [staggered](../glossary.md#_staggered) and can take only a single move action or standard action each turn, but not both (nor may it take full-round actions). Additionally, it takes a â€“1 penalty on attack rolls, [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class), and [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) saves. A _slowed _creature moves at half its normal speed (round down to the next 5-foot increment), which affects the creature's jumping distance as normal for decreased speed.

Multiple _slow _effects don't stack. _Slow _counters and dispels _ [haste](haste.md#_haste)_.
