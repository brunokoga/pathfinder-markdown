You can detect simple pits, deadfalls, and snares as well as mechanical traps constructed of natural materials. The spell does not detect complex traps, including trapdoor traps.

_Detect snares and pits _does detect certain natural hazards—quicksand (a snare), a sinkhole (a pit), or unsafe walls of natural rock (a deadfall). It does not reveal other potentially dangerous conditions. The spell does not [detect magic](detectMagic.html#_detect-magic) traps (except those that operate by pit, deadfall, or snaring; see the spell _ [snare](snare.html#_snare)_), nor mechanically complex ones, nor those that have been rendered safe or inactive.

The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area.

_1st Round_: Presence or absence of hazards.

_2nd Round_: Number of hazards and the location of each. If a hazard is outside your line of sight, then you discern its direction but not its exact location.

_Each Additional Round_: The general type and trigger for one particular hazard closely examined by you.

Each round, you can turn to examine a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
