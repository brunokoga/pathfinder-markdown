 **Eagle's Splendor**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2, paladin 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an eagle)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

The transmuted creature becomes more poised, articulate, and personally forceful. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new), adding the usual benefits to [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)-based skill checks and other uses of the [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. Bards, paladins, and sorcerers (and other spellcasters who rely on [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new)) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new), but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase.

**Target** One creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _eagle's splendor_, except that it affects multiple creatures.
