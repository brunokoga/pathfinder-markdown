The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

_Sickened_: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A creature affected by this spell remains [sickened](../glossary.html#_sickened) for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a _ [remove disease](removeDisease.html#_remove-disease) _or _ [heal](heal.html#_heal) _spell, but a _ [remove curse](removeCurse.html#_remove-curse) _is effective.

_Panicked_: The subject becomes [panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains [shaken](../glossary.html#_shaken) for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes [panicked](../glossary.html#_panicked) again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

_Comatose_: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a _ [sleep](sleep.html#_sleep) _effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.
