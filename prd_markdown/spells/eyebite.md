**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** : [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) negates; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** : yes

Each round, you can target a single living creature, striking it with waves of power. Depending on the target's HD, this attack has as many as three effects.

| HD | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| 10 or more | [Sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) |
| 5â€“9 | [Panicked](../glossary.md#_panicked), [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) |
| 4 or less | Comatose, [panicked](../glossary.md#_panicked), [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) |

The effects are cumulative and concurrent.

_Sickened_: Sudden pain and fever sweeps over the subject's body. A creature affected by this spell remains [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) for 10 minutes per caster level. The effects cannot be negated by a _ [remove disease](removeDisease.md#_remove-disease) _or _ [heal](heal.md#_heal) _spell, but a _ [remove curse](removeCurse.md#_remove-curse) _is effective.

_Panicked_: The subject becomes [panicked](../glossary.md#_panicked) for 1d4 rounds. Even after the panic ends, the creature remains [shaken](../glossary.md#_shaken) for 10 minutes per caster level, and it automatically becomes [panicked](../glossary.md#_panicked) again if it comes within sight of you during that time. This is a fear effect.

_Comatose_: The subject falls into a catatonic coma for 10 minutes per caster level. During this time, it cannot be awakened by any means short of dispelling the effect. This is not a _ [sleep](sleep.md#_sleep) _effect, and thus elves are not immune to it.

You must spend a swift action each round after the first to target a foe.
