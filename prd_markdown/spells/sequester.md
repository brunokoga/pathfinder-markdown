When cast, this spell prevents divination spells from detecting or locating the target and also renders the affected target [invisible](../glossary.md#_invisible) (as the _ [invisibility](invisibility.md#_invisibility) _spell). The spell does not prevent the subject from being discovered through tactile means or through the use of devices. Creatures affected by _sequester _become comatose and are effectively in a state of suspended animation until the spell ends.

_Note_: The [Will](../combat.md#_will) save prevents an attended or magical object from being _sequestered. _There is no save to see the _sequestered _creature or object or to detect it with a divination spell.
