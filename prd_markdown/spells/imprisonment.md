When you cast _imprisonment _and touch a creature, it is entombed in a state of suspended animation (see the _ [temporal stasis](temporalStasis.md#_temporal-stasis) _spell) in a small sphere far beneath the surface of the ground. The subject remains there unless a _freedom _spell is cast at the locale where the imprisonment took place. Magical search by a _crystal ball, _a _ [locate object](locateObject.md#_locate-object) _spell, or some other similar divination does not reveal the fact that a creature is imprisoned, but _ [discern location](discernLocation.md#_discern-location) _does. A _ [wish](wish.md#_wish) _or _ [miracle](miracle.md#_miracle) _spell will not free the recipient, but will reveal where it is entombed. If you know the target's name and some facts about its life, the target takes a â€“4 penalty on its save.
