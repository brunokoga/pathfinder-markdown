 **Owl's Wisdom**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an owl)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom), adding the usual benefit to [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom)-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom)-based spellcasters) who receive _owl's wisdom _do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom), but the save DCs for their spells increase.
