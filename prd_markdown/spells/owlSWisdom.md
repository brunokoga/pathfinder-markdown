 **Owl's Wisdom**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, druid 2, paladin 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (feathers or droppings from an owl)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

The transmuted creature becomes wiser. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.md#_wisdom), adding the usual benefit to [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.md#_wisdom)-related skills. Clerics, druids, and rangers (and other [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.md#_wisdom)-based spellcasters) who receive _owl's wisdom _do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.md#_wisdom), but the save DCs for their spells increase.

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _owl's wisdom_, except that it affects multiple creatures.
