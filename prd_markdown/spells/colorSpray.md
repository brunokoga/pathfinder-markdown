A vivid cone of clashing colors springs forth from your hand, causing creatures to become [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned), perhaps also [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded), and possibly knocking them [unconscious](../glossary.md#_unconscious). Each creature within the cone is affected according to its HD.

_2 HD or less_: The creature is [unconscious](../glossary.md#_unconscious), [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded), and [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 2d4 rounds, then [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded) and [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1d4 rounds, and then [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1 round. (Only living creatures are knocked [unconscious](../glossary.md#_unconscious).)

_3 or 4 HD_: The creature is [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded) and [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1d4 rounds, then [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1 round.

_5 or more HD_: The creature is [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1 round.

Sightless creatures are not affected by _color spray_.
