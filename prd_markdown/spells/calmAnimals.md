This spell soothes and quiets animals, rendering them docile and harmless. Only ordinary animals (those with [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) scores of 1 or 2) can be affected by this spell. All the subjects must be of the same kind, and no two may be more than 30 feet apart. The maximum number of HD of animals you can affect is equal to 2d4 + caster level.

The affected creatures remain where they are and do not attack or flee. They are not [helpless](../glossary.md#_helpless) and defend themselves normally if attacked. Any threat breaks the spell on the threatened creatures.
