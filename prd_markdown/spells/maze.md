You banish the subject into an extradimensional labyrinth. Each round on its turn, it may attempt a DC 20 [Intelligence](../gettingStarted#_intelligence) check to escape the labyrinth as a full-round action. If the subject doesn't escape, the maze disappears after 10 minutes, freeing the subject.

On escaping or leaving the maze, the subject reappears where it had been when the _maze _spell was cast. If this location is filled with a solid object, the subject appears in the nearest open space. Spells and abilities that move a creature within a plane, such as _ [teleport](teleport#_teleport) _and _ [dimension door](dimensionDoor#_dimension-door), _do not help a creature escape a _maze _spell, although a _ [plane shift](planeShift#_plane-shift) _spell allows it to exit to whatever plane is designated in that spell. Minotaurs are not affected by this spell.
