A _grease _spell covers a solid surface with a layer of slippery grease. Any creature in the area when the spell is cast must make a successful [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) save or fall. A creature can walk within or through the area of grease at half normal speed with a DC 10 Acrobatics check. Failure means it can't move that round (and must then make a [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) save or fall), while failure by 5 or more means it falls (see the Acrobatics skill for details). Creatures that do not move on their turn do not need to make this check and are not considered [flat-footed](../glossary.md#_flat-footed).

The spell can also be used to create a greasy coating on an item. Material objects not in use are always affected by this spell, while an object wielded or employed by a creature requires its bearer to make a [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) saving throw to avoid the effect. If the initial saving throw fails, the creature immediately drops the item. A saving throw must be made in each round that the creature attempts to pick up or use the _greased _item. A creature wearing _greased _armor or clothing gains a +10 circumstance bonus on Escape Artist checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape a grapple, and to their [CMD](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-defense) to avoid being [grappled](../glossary.md#_grappled).
