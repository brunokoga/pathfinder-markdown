 **Demand**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) partial; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell functions like _ [sending](sending.html#_sending), _but the message can also contain a _ [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion) _(see the _ [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion) _spell), which the subject does its best to carry out. A successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save negates the _ [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion) _effect but not the contact itself. The _demand, _if received, is understood even if the subject's [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score is as low as 1. If the message is impossible or meaningless according to the circumstances that exist for the subject at the time the _demand _is issued, the message is understood but the _ [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion) _is ineffective.

The _demand_'s message to the creature must be 25 words or less, including the _ [suggestion](suggestion.html#_suggestion). _The creature can also give a short reply immediately.
