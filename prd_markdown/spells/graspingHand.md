 **Grasping Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

This spell functions as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.md#_interposing-hand)_, except that it can also grapple one opponent you select. The _grasping hand_ gets one grapple attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its [CMB](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-bonus) and [CMD](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-defense) for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +10 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength) (31) score and a +1 bonus for being Large (its [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.md#_dexterity) is 10, granting no bonus on the [Combat Maneuver Defense](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-defense)). The hand holds but does not harm creatures that it grapples. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. The _grasping hand_ can instead be directed to bull rush a target, using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.md#_interposing-hand)_ does.
