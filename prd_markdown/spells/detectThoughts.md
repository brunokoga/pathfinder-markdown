You detect surface thoughts. The amount of information revealed depends on how long you study a particular area or subject.

_1st Round_: Presence or absence of thoughts (from conscious creatures with [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) scores of 1 or higher).

_2nd Round_: Number of thinking minds and the [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) score of each. If the highest [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) is 26 or higher (and at least 10 points higher than your own [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) score), you are [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned) for 1 round and the spell ends. This spell does not let you determine the location of the thinking minds if you can't see the creatures whose thoughts you are detecting.

_3rd Round_: Surface thoughts of any mind in the area. A target's [Will](../combat.md#_will) save prevents you from reading its thoughts, and you must cast _detect thoughts _again to have another chance. Creatures of animal intelligence ( [Int](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) 1 or 2) have simple, instinctual thoughts.

Each round, you can turn to detect thoughts in a new area. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
