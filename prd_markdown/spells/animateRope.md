You can animate a nonliving rope-like object. The maximum length assumes a rope with a 1-inch diameter. Reduce the maximum length by 50% for every additional inch of thickness, and increase it by 50% for each reduction of the rope's diameter by half.

The possible commands are âcoilâ (form a neat, coiled stack), âcoil and knot,â âloop,â âloop and knot,â âtie and knot,â and the opposites of all of the above (âuncoil,â and so forth). You can give one command each round as a move action, as if directing an active spell.

The rope can enwrap only a creature or an object within 1 foot of it—it does not snake outward—so it must be thrown near the intended target. Doing so requires a successful ranged touch attack roll (range increment 10 feet). A typical 1-inch-diameter hemp rope has 2 hit points, [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) 10, and requires a DC 23 [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) check to burst it. The rope does not deal damage, but it can be used as a trip line or to cause a single opponent that fails a [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) saving throw to become [entangled](../glossary.html#_entangled). A creature capable of spellcasting that is bound by this spell must make a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level to cast a spell. An [entangled](../glossary.html#_entangled) creature can slip free with a DC 20 Escape Artist check.

The rope itself and any knots tied in it are not magical.

The spell cannot affect objects carried or worn by a creature.
