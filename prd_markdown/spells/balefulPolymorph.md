As _ [beast shape III](beastShape#_beast-shape-iii), _except that you change the subject into a Small or smaller animal of no more than 1 HD. If the new form would prove fatal to the creature, such as an aquatic creature not in water, the subject gets a +4 bonus on the save.

If the spell succeeds, the subject must also make a [Will](../combat#_will) save. If this second save fails, the creature loses its extraordinary, supernatural, and spell-like abilities, loses its ability to cast spells (if it had the ability), and gains the alignment, special abilities, and [Intelligence](../gettingStarted#_intelligence), [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom), and [Charisma](../gettingStarted#_charisma-new) scores of its new form in place of its own. It still retains its class and level (or HD), as well as all benefits deriving therefrom (such as base attack bonus, base save bonuses, and hit points). It retains any class features (other than spellcasting) that aren't extraordinary, supernatural, or spell-like abilities.

Any polymorph effects on the target are automatically dispelled when a target fails to resist the effects of _baleful polymorph_, and as long as _baleful polymorph_ remains in effect, the target cannot use other polymorph spells or effects to assume a new form. [Incorporeal](../glossary#_incorporeal) or gaseous creatures are immune to _baleful polymorph_, and a creature with the shapechanger subtype can revert to its natural form as a standard action.
