_Stinking cloud _creates a bank of fog like that created by _ [fog cloud](fogCloud.md)_, except that the vapors are nauseating. Living creatures in the cloud become [nauseated](../glossary.md#_nauseated). This condition lasts as long as the creature is in the cloud and for 1d4+1 rounds after it leaves. (Roll separately for each [nauseated](../glossary.md#_nauseated) character.) Any creature that succeeds on its save but remains in the cloud must continue to save each round on your turn. This is a poison effect.

_Stinking cloud _can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](permanency.md#_permanency) _spell. A permanent _stinking cloud _dispersed by wind reforms in 10 minutes.
