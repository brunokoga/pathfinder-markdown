A green ray springs from your hand. You must make a ranged touch attack to hit the target. Any creature or object struck by the ray is covered with a shimmering emerald field that completely blocks extradimensional travel. Forms of movement barred by a _dimensional anchor _include _ [astral projection](astralProjection.md#_astral-projection), blink, [dimension door](dimensionDoor.md#_dimension-door), [ethereal jaunt](etherealJaunt.md#_ethereal-jaunt), [etherealness](etherealness.md#_etherealness), [gate](gate.md#_gate), [maze](maze.md#_maze), [plane shift](planeShift.md#_plane-shift), [shadow walk](shadowWalk.md#_shadow-walk), [teleport](teleport.md#_teleport), _and similar spell-like abilities. The spell also prevents the use of a _gate _or _ [teleportation circle](teleportationCircle.md#_teleportation-circle) _for the duration of the spell.

A _dimensional anchor _does not interfere with the movement of creatures already in ethereal or astral form when the spell is cast, nor does it block extradimensional perception or attack forms. Also, _dimensional anchor _does not prevent summoned creatures from disappearing at the end of a summoning spell.
