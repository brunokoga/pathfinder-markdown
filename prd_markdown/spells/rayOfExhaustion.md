 **Ray of Exhaustion**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Effect** ray

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) partial; see text; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

A black ray projects from your pointing finger. You must succeed on a ranged touch attack with the ray to strike a target.

The subject is immediately [exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted) for the spell's duration. A successful [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save means the creature is only [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued).

A character that is already [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) instead becomes [exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted).

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [exhausted](../glossary.html#_exhausted). Unlike normal exhaustion or fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
