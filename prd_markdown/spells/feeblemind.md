 **Feeblemind**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a handful of clay, crystal, or glass spheres)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates; see text; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

Target creature's [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) and [Charisma](../gettingStarted.md#_charisma-new) scores each drop to 1. The affected creature is unable to use [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence)- or [Charisma](../gettingStarted.md#_charisma-new)-based skills, cast spells, understand language, or communicate coherently. Still, it knows who its friends are and can follow them and even protect them. The subject remains in this state until a _ [heal](heal.md#_heal)_, _ [limited wish](limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_, _ [miracle](miracle.md#_miracle)_, or _ [wish](wish.md#_wish) _spell is used to cancel the effect of the _feeblemind_. A creature that can cast arcane spells, such as a sorcerer or a wizard, takes a â€“4 penalty on its saving throw.
