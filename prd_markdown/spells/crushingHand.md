 **Crushing Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

This spell functions as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)_, except that it can also grapple one opponent as _ [grasping hand](graspingHand.html#_grasping-hand)_. Its [CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) and [CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense) for grapple checks use your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +12 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score (35) and a +1 bonus for being Large (its [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) is 10, granting no bonus to the [CMD](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-defense)). A _crushing hand _deals 2d6+12 points of damage on each successful grapple check against an opponent. The _crushing hand_ can instead be directed to bull rush a target (as _ [forceful hand](forcefulHand.html#_forceful-hand)_), using the same bonuses outlined above, or it can be directed to interpose itself, as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand)_ does.
