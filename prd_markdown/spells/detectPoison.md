You determine whether a creature, object, or area has been poisoned or is poisonous. You can determine the exact type of poison with a DC 20 [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) check. A character with the Craft (alchemy) skill may try a DC 20 Craft (alchemy) check if the [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) check fails, or may try the Craft (alchemy) check prior to the [Wisdom](../gettingStarted#_wisdom) check. The spell can penetrate barriers, but 1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood or dirt blocks it.
