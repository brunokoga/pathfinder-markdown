 **Clenched Fist**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8

**Components** V, S, F/DF (a leather glove)

This spell functions like _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand), _except that the hand can also push or strike one opponent that you select. The floating hand can move as far as 60 feet and can attack in the same round. Since this hand is directed by you, its ability to notice or attack [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) or concealed creatures is no better than yours.

The hand attacks once per round, and its attack bonus equals your caster level + your [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence), [Wisdom](../gettingStarted.html#_wisdom), or [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier (for a wizard, cleric, or sorcerer, respectively) + 11 for the hand's [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score (33), â€“ 1 for being Large. The hand deals 1d8+11 points of damage on each attack, and any creature struck must make a [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) save (against this spell's save DC) or be [stunned](../glossary.html#_stunned) for 1 round. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action.

The _clenched fist _can also interpose itself as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.html#_interposing-hand) _does, or it can bull rush an opponent as _ [forceful hand](forcefulHand.html#_forceful-hand) _does. Its [CMB](../combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +11 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) score and a +1 bonus for being Large.
