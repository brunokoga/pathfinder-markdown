 **Death Ward**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 4, druid 5, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** living creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

The subject gains a +4 morale bonus on saves against all death spells and magical death effects. The subject is granted a save to negate such effects even if one is not normally allowed. The subject is immune to [energy drain](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) and any negative energy effects, including channeled negative energy.

This spell does not remove [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) that the subject has already gained, but it does remove the penalties from [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) for the duration of its effect.

_Death ward _does not protect against other sorts of attacks, even if those attacks might be lethal.
