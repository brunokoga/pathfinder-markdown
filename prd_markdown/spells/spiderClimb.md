The subject can climb and travel on vertical surfaces or even traverse ceilings as well as a spider does. The affected creature must have its hands free to climb in this manner. The subject gains a climb speed of 20 feet and a +8 racial bonus on Climb skill checks; furthermore, it need not make Climb checks to traverse a vertical or horizontal surface (even upside down). A _spider climbing _creature retains its [Dexterity](../gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to [Armor Class](../combat.html#_armor-class) (if any) while climbing, and opponents get no special bonus to their attacks against it. It cannot, however, use the run action while climbing.
