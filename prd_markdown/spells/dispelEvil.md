Shimmering, white holy energy surrounds you. This energy has three effects.

First, you gain a +4 deflection bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks by evil creatures.

Second, on making a successful melee touch attack against an evil creature from another plane, you can choose to drive that creature back to its home plane. The creature can negate the effects with a successful [Will](../combat.html#_will) save ( [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) applies). This use discharges and ends the spell.

Third, with a touch you can automatically dispel any one enchantment spell cast by an evil creature or any one evil spell. Spells that can't be dispelled by _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic) _also can't be dispelled by _dispel evil_. Saving throws and [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) do not apply to this effect. This use discharges and ends the spell.
