 **Geas, Lesser**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 round

**Components** V

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature with 7 HD or less

**Duration** 1 day/level or until discharged (D)

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

A _lesser geas _places a magical command on a creature to carry out some service or to refrain from some action or course of activity, as desired by you. The creature must have 7 or fewer HD and be able to understand you. While a _geas _cannot compel a creature to kill itself or perform acts that would result in certain death, it can cause almost any other course of activity.

The _geased _creature must follow the given instructions until the _geas _is completed, no matter how long it takes.

If the instructions involve some open-ended task that the recipient cannot complete through his own actions, the spell remains in effect for a maximum of 1 day per caster level. A clever recipient can subvert some instructions.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the _lesser geas _for 24 hours, it takes a –2 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –2 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –8. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the _lesser geas._

A _lesser geas _(and all ability score penalties) can be ended by _ [break enchantment](breakEnchantment.md#_break-enchantment)_, _ [limited wish](limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_, _ [remove curse](removeCurse.md#_remove-curse)_, _ [miracle](miracle.md#_miracle)_, or _ [wish](wish.md#_wish)_. _ [Dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic) _does not affect a _lesser geas_.

**Geas/Quest**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 6, cleric 6, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Target** one living creature

**Saving Throw** none; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell functions similarly to _lesser geas, _except that it affects a creature of any HD and allows no saving throw.

If the subject is prevented from obeying the _geas/quest _for 24 hours, it takes a –3 penalty to each of its ability scores. Each day, another –3 penalty accumulates, up to a total of –12. No ability score can be reduced to less than 1 by this effect. The ability score penalties are removed 24 hours after the subject resumes obeying the _geas/quest._

A _ [remove curse](removeCurse.md#_remove-curse) _spell ends a _geas/quest _spell only if its caster level is at least two higher than your caster level. _ [Break enchantment](breakEnchantment.md#_break-enchantment) _does not end a _geas/quest_, but _ [limited wish](limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_, _ [miracle](miracle.md#_miracle)_, and _ [wish](wish.md#_wish) _do.

Bards, sorcerers, and wizards usually refer to this spell as _geas, _while clerics call the same spell _quest_.
