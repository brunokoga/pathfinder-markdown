The subject feels an undeniable urge to dance and begins doing so, complete with foot shuffling and tapping. The spell effect makes it impossible for the subject to do anything other than caper and prance in place. The effect imposes a –4 penalty to [Armor Class](../combat#_armor-class) and a –10 penalty on [Reflex](../combat#_reflex) saves, and it negates any [AC](../combat#_armor-class) bonus granted by a shield the target holds. The dancing subject provokes attacks of opportunity each round on its turn. A successful [Will](../combat#_will) save reduces the duration of this effect to 1 round.
