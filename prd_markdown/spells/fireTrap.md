_Fire trap _creates a fiery explosion when an intruder opens the item that the trap protects. A _fire trap _spell can ward any object that can be opened and closed.

When casting _fire trap, _you select a point on the object as the spell's center. When someone other than you opens the object, a fiery explosion fills the area within a 5-foot radius around the spell's center. The flames deal 1d4 points of fire damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20). The item protected by the trap is not harmed by this explosion.

A fire-trapped item cannot have a second closure or warding spell placed on it. A _ [knock](knock.md#_knock) _spell does not bypass a _fire trap_. An unsuccessful _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic) _spell does not detonate the spell. Underwater, this ward deals half damage and creates a large cloud of steam.

You can use the fire-trapped object without discharging it, as can any individual to whom the object was specifically attuned when cast. Attuning a fire-trapped object to an individual usually involves setting a password that you can share with friends.

Magic traps such as _fire trap _are hard to detect and disable. A character with trapfinding can use the Perception skill to find a _fire trap _and Disable Device to thwart it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level (DC 27 for a druid's _fire trap _or DC 29 for the arcane version).
