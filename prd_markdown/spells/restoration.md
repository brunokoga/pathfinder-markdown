**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

This spell functions like _lesser restoration,_ except that it also dispels temporary [negative levels](../glossary.html#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or one permanent negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative level, it has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp.

_Restoration_ cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.
