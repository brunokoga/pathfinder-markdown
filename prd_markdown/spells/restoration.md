 **Restoration**

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 4, paladin 4

**Casting Time** 3 rounds

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 100 gp or 1,000 gp, see text)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

This spell functions like _lesser restoration,_ except that it also dispels temporary [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or one permanent negative level. If this spell is used to dispel a permanent negative level, it has a material component of diamond dust worth 1,000 gp. This spell cannot be used to dispel more than one permanent [negative level](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)possessed by a target in a 1-week period.

_Restoration_ cures all temporary ability damage, and it restores all points permanently drained from a single ability score (your choice if more than one is drained). It also eliminates any fatigue or exhaustion suffered by the target.

**Restoration, Greater**

This spell functions like _lesser restoration,_ except that it dispels all permanent and temporary [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) afflicting the healed creature. _Greater restoration_ also dispels all magical effects penalizing the creature's abilities, cures all temporary ability damage, and restores all points permanently drained from all ability scores. It also eliminates fatigue and exhaustion, and removes all forms of insanity, confusion, and similar mental effects.
