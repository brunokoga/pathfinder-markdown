_Shield _creates an invisible shield of force that hovers in front of you. It negates _ [magic missile](magicMissile.md#_magic-missile) _attacks directed at you. The disk also provides a +4 shield bonus to [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class). This bonus applies against [incorporeal](../glossary.md#_incorporeal) touch attacks, since it is a force effect. The _shield _has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance.
