S_ecret page _alters the contents of a page so that it appears to be something entirely different. The text of a spell can be changed to show another spell of equal or lower level known by the caster. This spell cannot be used to change a spell contained on a scroll, but it can be used to hide a scroll. _ [Explosive runes](explosiveRunes.md#_explosive-runes) _or _ [sepia snake sigil](sepiaSnakeSigil.md#_sepia-snake-sigil) _can be cast upon the _secret page._

A _ [comprehend languages](comprehendLanguages.md#_comprehend-languages) _spell alone cannot reveal a _secret page_'s contents. You are able to reveal the original contents by speaking a special word. You can then peruse the actual page and return it to its _secret page _form at will. You can also remove the spell by double repetition of the special word. A _ [detect magic](detectMagic.md#_detect-magic) _spell reveals dim magic on the page in question but does not reveal its true contents. _ [True seeing](trueSeeing.md#_true-seeing) _reveals the presence of the hidden material but does not reveal the contents unless cast in combination with _ [comprehend languages](comprehendLanguages.md#_comprehend-languages). _A _secret page _spell can be dispelled, and the hidden writings can be destroyed by means of an _erase _spell.
