 **Halt Undead**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of sulfur and powdered garlic)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** up to three undead creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (see text); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell renders as many as three undead creatures immobile. A nonintelligent undead creature gets no saving throw; an intelligent undead creature does. If the spell is successful, it renders the undead creature immobile for the duration of the spell (similar to the effect of _ [hold person](holdPerson.md#_hold-person) _on a living creature). The effect is broken if the _halted _creatures are attacked or take damage.
