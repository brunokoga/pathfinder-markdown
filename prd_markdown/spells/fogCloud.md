**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft. level)

A bank of fog billows out from the point you designate. The fog obscures all sight, including [darkvision](../glossary.md#_darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A creature within 5 feet has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker can't use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

The spell does not function underwater.
