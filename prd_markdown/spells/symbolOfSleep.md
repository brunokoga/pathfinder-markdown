This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.html#_symbol-of-death)_, except that all creatures of 10 HD or less within 60 feet of the _symbol of sleep _instead fall into a catatonic slumber for 3d6 × 10 minutes. Unlike with the _ [sleep](sleep.html#_sleep) _spell, sleeping creatures cannot be awakened by nonmagical means before this time expires.

Unlike _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.html#_symbol-of-death)_, _symbol of sleep _has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of sleep _simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of sleep _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for _symbol of sleep_.
