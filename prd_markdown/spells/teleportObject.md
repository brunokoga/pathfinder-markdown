 **Teleport Object**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7

**Range** touch

**Target** one touched object of up to 50 lbs./level and 3 cu. ft./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (object); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes (object)

This spell functions like _ [teleport](teleport.md#_teleport), _except that it teleports an object, not you. Creatures and magical forces cannot be teleported.

If desired, the target object can be sent to a distant location on the Ethereal Plane. In this case, the point from which the object was teleported remains faintly magical until the item is retrieved. A successful targeted _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic) _spell cast on that point brings the vanished item back from the Ethereal Plane.
