_Heal _enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, [blinded](../glossary#_blinded), [confused](../glossary#_confused)_, _ [dazed](../glossary#_dazed), [dazzled](../glossary#_dazzled), [deafened](../glossary#_deafened), diseased, [exhausted](../glossary#_exhausted), [fatigued](../glossary#_fatigued), [feeblemind](feeblemind#_feeblemind)ed_, _ [insanity](insanity#_insanity), [nauseated](../glossary#_nauseated), poisoned, [sickened](../glossary#_sickened), and [stunned](../glossary#_stunned). It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

_Heal _does not remove [negative levels](../glossary#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, _heal _instead acts like _ [harm](harm#_harm)_.
