_Heal _enables you to channel positive energy into a creature to wipe away injury and afflictions. It immediately ends any and all of the following adverse conditions affecting the target: ability damage, [blinded](../glossary.md#_blinded), [confused](../glossary.md#_confused)_, _ [dazed](../glossary.md#_dazed), [dazzled](../glossary.md#_dazzled), [deafened](../glossary.md#_deafened), diseased, [exhausted](../glossary.md#_exhausted), [fatigued](../glossary.md#_fatigued), [feeblemind](feeblemind.md#_feeblemind)ed_, _ [insanity](insanity.md#_insanity), [nauseated](../glossary.md#_nauseated), poisoned, [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened), and [stunned](../glossary.md#_stunned). It also cures 10 hit points of damage per level of the caster, to a maximum of 150 points at 15th level.

_Heal _does not remove [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels) or restore permanently drained ability score points.

If used against an undead creature, _heal _instead acts like _ [harm](harm.md#_harm)_.
