This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, except that all creatures within the radius of the _symbol of insanity _instead become permanently insane (as the _ [insanity](insanity.md#_insanity) _spell).

Unlike _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, symbol of insanity has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of insanity _simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of insanity _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for _symbol of insanity_.
