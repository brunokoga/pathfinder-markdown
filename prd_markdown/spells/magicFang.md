This spell functions like _magic fang_, except that the enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls is +1 per four caster levels (maximum +5). This bonus does not allow a natural weapon or unarmed strike to bypass [damage reduction](../glossary.md#_damage-reduction) aside from magic.

Alternatively, you may imbue all of the creature's natural weapons with a +1 enhancement bonus (regardless of your caster level).

_Greater magic fang _can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](permanency.md#_permanency) _spell.
