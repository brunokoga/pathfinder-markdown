**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 1,000 gp)

This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath#_symbol-of-death)_, except that each creature within the radius of a _symbol of pain _instead suffers wracking pains that impose a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks. These effects last for 1 hour after the creature moves farther than 60 feet from the symbol.

Unlike _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath#_symbol-of-death)_, _symbol of pain _has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of pain _simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of pain _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 30 for _symbol of pain_.
