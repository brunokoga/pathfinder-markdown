A pale glow surrounds and outlines the subjects. Outlined subjects shed light as candles. Creatures outlined by _faerie fire_ take a â€“20 penalty on all Stealth checks. Outlined creatures do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness (though a 2nd-level or higher magical _darkness _effect functions normally), _ [blur](blur.md#_blur)_, _ [displacement](displacement.md#_displacement), [invisibility](invisibility.md#_invisibility),_ or similar effects. The light is too dim to have any special effect on undead or dark-dwelling creatures vulnerable to light. The _faerie fire _can be blue, green, or violet, according to your choice at the time of casting. The _faerie fire _does not cause any harm to the objects or creatures thus outlined.
