 **Spell Immunity**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 10 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary#_spell-resistance)** yes (harmless)

The warded creature is immune to the effects of one specified spell for every four levels you have. The spells must be of 4th level or lower. The warded creature effectively has unbeatable [spell resistance](../glossary#_spell-resistance) regarding the specified spell or spells. Naturally, that immunity doesn't protect a creature from spells for which [spell resistance](../glossary#_spell-resistance) doesn't apply. _Spell immunity _protects against spells, spell-like effects of magic items, and innate spell-like abilities of creatures. It does not protect against supernatural or extraordinary abilities, such as breath weapons or gaze attacks.

Only a particular spell can be protected against, not a certain domain or school of spells or a group of spells that are similar in effect. A creature can have only one _spell immunity _or _greater spell immunity _spell in effect on it at a time.

**Spell Immunity, Greater**

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 8

This spell functions like _spell immunity_, except the immunity applies to spells of 8th level or lower. A creature can have only one _spell immunity _or _greater spell immunity _spell in effect on it at a time.
