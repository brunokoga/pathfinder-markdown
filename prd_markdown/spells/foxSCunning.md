 **Fox's Cunning**

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (hairs or dung from a fox)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 min./level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates (harmless); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

The target becomes smarter. The spell grants a +4 enhancement bonus to [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence), adding the usual benefits to [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence)-based skill checks and other uses of the [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence) modifier. Wizards (and other spellcasters who rely on [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence)) affected by this spell do not gain any additional bonus spells for the increased [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.md#_intelligence), but the save DCs for spells they cast while under this spell's effect do increase. This spell doesn't grant extra skill ranks.
