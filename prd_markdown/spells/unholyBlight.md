You call up unholy power to smite your enemies. The power takes the form of a cold, cloying miasma of greasy darkness. Only good and neutral (not evil) creatures are harmed by the spell.

The spell deals 1d8 points of damage per two caster levels (maximum 5d8) to a good creature (or 1d6 per caster level, maximum 10d6, to a good outsider) and causes it to be [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) for 1d4 rounds. A successful [Will](../combat.md#_will) save reduces damage to half and negates the [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) effect. The effects cannot be negated by _ [remove disease](removeDisease.md#_remove-disease) _or _ [heal](heal.md#_heal), _but _ [remove curse](removeCurse.md#_remove-curse) _is effective.

The spell deals only half damage to creatures who are neither evil nor good, and they are not [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened). Such a creature can reduce the damage by half again (down to one-quarter) with a successful [Will](../combat.md#_will) save.
