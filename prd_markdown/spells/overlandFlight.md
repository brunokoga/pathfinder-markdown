 **Overland Flight**

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 5

**Components** : V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 hour/level

This spell functions like a _ [fly](fly.md) _spell, except you can fly at a speed of 40 feet (30 feet if wearing medium or heavy armor, or if carrying a medium or heavy load) with a bonus on [Fly](../skills/fly.md#_fly) skill checks equal to half your caster level. When using this spell for long-distance movement, you can hustle without taking nonlethal damage (a forced march still requires [Constitution](../gettingStarted.md#_constitution) checks). This means you can cover 64 miles in an 8-hour period of flight (or 48 miles at a speed of 30 feet).
