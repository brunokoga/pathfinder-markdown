This cantrip creates a burst of light. If you cause the light to burst in front of a single creature, that creature is [dazzled](../glossary.md#_dazzled) for 1 minute unless it makes a successful [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save. Sightless creatures, as well as creatures already [dazzled](../glossary.md#_dazzled), are not affected by _flare_.
