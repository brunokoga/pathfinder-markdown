This spell makes a lock or other small mechanism seem to be trapped to anyone who can detect traps. You place the spell upon any small mechanism or device, such as a lock, hinge, hasp, cork, cap, or ratchet. Any character able to detect traps, or who uses any spell or device enabling trap detection, is certain a real trap exists. Of course, the effect is illusory and nothing happens if the trap is “sprung”; its primary purpose is to frighten away thieves or make them waste precious time.

If another _phantom trap _is active within 50 feet when the spell is cast, the casting fails.
