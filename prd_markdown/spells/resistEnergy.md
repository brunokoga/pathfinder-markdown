This abjuration grants a creature limited protection from damage of whichever one of five energy types you select: acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic. The subject gains resist energy 10 against the energy type chosen, meaning that each time the creature is subjected to such damage (whether from a natural or magical source), that damage is reduced by 10 points before being applied to the creature's hit points. The value of the [energy resistance](../glossary.md#_energy-resistance) granted increases to 20 points at 7th level and to a maximum of 30 points at 11th level. The spell protects the recipient's equipment as well.

_Resist energy _absorbs only damage. The subject could still suffer unfortunate side effects.

_Resist energy _overlaps (and does not stack with) _ [protection from energy](protectionFromEnergy.md#_protection-from-energy). _If a character is warded by _ [protection from energy](protectionFromEnergy.md#_protection-from-energy) _and _resist energy, _the _protection _spell absorbs damage until its power is [exhausted](../glossary.md#_exhausted).
