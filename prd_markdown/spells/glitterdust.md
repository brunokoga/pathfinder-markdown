A cloud of golden particles covers everyone and everything in the area, causing creatures to become [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) and visibly outlining [invisible](../glossary.html#_invisible) things for the duration of the spell. All within the area are covered by the dust, which cannot be removed and continues to sparkle until it fades. Each round at the end of their turn [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) creatures may attempt new saving throws to end the blindness effect.

Any creature covered by the dust takes a –40 penalty on Stealth checks.
