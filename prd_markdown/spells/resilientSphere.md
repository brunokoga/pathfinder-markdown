A globe of shimmering force encloses a creature, provided the creature is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere functions as a _ [wall of force](wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force)_, except that it can be negated by _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic)_. A subject inside the sphere can breathe normally. The sphere cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.
