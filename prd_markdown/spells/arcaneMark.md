This spell allows you to inscribe your personal rune or mark, which can consist of no more than six characters. The writing can be visible or invisible. An _arcane mark _spell enables you to etch the rune upon any substance without harm to the material upon which it is placed. If an invisible mark is made, a _ [detect magic](detectMagic.md#_detect-magic) _spell causes it to glow and be visible, though not necessarily understandable.

_ [See invisibility](seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility), [true seeing](trueSeeing.md#_true-seeing)_, a _gem of seeing_, or a _robe of eyes _likewise allows the user to see an invisible _arcane mark. _A _ [read magic](readMagic.md#_read-magic) _spell reveals the words, if any. The mark cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by the caster or by an _erase _spell.

If an _arcane mark _is placed on a living being, the effect gradually fades in about a month.

_Arcane mark _must be cast on an object prior to casting _ [instant summons](instantSummons.md#_instant-summons) _on the same object (see that spell description for details).
