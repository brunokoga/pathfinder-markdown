A random pattern of color surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by lawful creatures, and causing lawful creatures that strike the subjects to become _ [confused](../glossary.md#_confused). _This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class) and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _ [protection from law](protectionFromLaw.md#_protection-from-law)_, the benefit of this spell applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by lawful creatures.

Second, each warded creature gains [spell resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance) 25 against lawful spells and spells cast by lawful creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects from possession and mental influence, just as _ [protection from law](protectionFromLaw.md#_protection-from-law) _does.

Finally, if a lawful creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the offending attacker is _ [confused](../glossary.md#_confused) _for 1 round ( [Will](../combat.md#_will) save negates, as with the _ [confusion](confusion.md#_confusion) _spell, but against the save DC of _cloak of chaos_).
