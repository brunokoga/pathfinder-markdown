 **Weird**

**School** illusion (phantasm) [fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 9

**Targets** any number of creatures, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _ [phantasmal killer](phantasmalKiller#_phantasmal-killer)_, except it can affect more than one creature. Only the affected creatures see the phantasmal creatures attacking them, though you see the attackers as shadowy shapes.

If a subject's [Fortitude](../combat#_fortitude) save succeeds, it still takes 3d6 points of damage and is [stunned](../glossary#_stunned) for 1 round. The subject also takes 1d4 points of [Strength](../gettingStarted#_strength) damage.
