Animals cannot sense the warded creatures. Even extraordinary or supernatural sensory capabilities, such as [blindsense](../glossary.md#_blindsight-and-blindsense), [blindsight](../glossary.md#_blindsight-and-blindsense), [scent](../glossary.md#_scent), and tremorsense, cannot detect or locate warded creatures. Animals simply act as though the warded creatures are not there. If a warded character touches an animal or attacks any creature, even with a spell, the spell ends for all recipients.
