A misty vapor arises around you. It is stationary. The vapor obscures all sight, including [darkvision](../glossary.md#_darkvision), beyond 5 feet. A creature 5 feet away has concealment (attacks have a 20% miss chance). Creatures farther away have total concealment (50% miss chance, and the attacker cannot use sight to locate the target).

A moderate wind (11+ mph), such as from a _ [gust of wind](gustOfWind.md#_gust-of-wind) _spell, disperses the fog in 4 rounds. A strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round. A _ [fireball](fireball.md#_fireball), [flame strike](flameStrike.md#_flame-strike)_, or similar spell burns away the fog in the explosive or fiery spell's area. A _ [wall of fire](wallOfFire.md#_wall-of-fire) _burns away the fog in the area into which it deals damage.

This spell does not function underwater.
