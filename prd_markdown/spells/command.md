You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options.

_Approach_: On its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The creature may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Drop_: On its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.

_Fall_: On its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains [prone](../glossary.md#_prone) for 1 round. It may act normally while [prone](../glossary.md#_prone) but takes any appropriate penalties.

_Flee_: On its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn, and it provokes attacks of opportunity for this movement as normal.

_Halt_: The subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered [helpless](../glossary.md#_helpless).

If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the spell automatically fails.

**Command, Greater**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 5

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

This spell functions like _command, _except that up to one creature per level may be affected, and the activities continue beyond 1 round. At the start of each commanded creature's action after the first, it gets another [Will](../combat.md#_will) save to attempt to break free from the spell. Each creature must receive the same command.
