 **Hideous Laughter**

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (tiny fruit tarts and a feather)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature; see text

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) negates; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

This spell afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling [prone](../glossary.html#_prone). The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered [helpless](../glossary.html#_helpless). After the spell ends, it can act normally. On the creature's next turn, it may attempt a new saving throw to end the effect. This is a full round action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If this save is successful, the effect ends. If not, the creature continues laughing for the entire duration.

A creature with an [Intelligence](../gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) score of 2 or lower is not affected. A creature whose type is different from the caster's receives a +4 bonus on its saving throw, because humor doesn't âtranslateâ well.
