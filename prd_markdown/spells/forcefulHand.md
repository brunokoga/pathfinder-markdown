 **Forceful Hand**

**School** evocation [force]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

This spell functions as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.md#_interposing-hand)_, except that it can also pursue and bull rush one opponent you select. The _forceful hand_ gets one bull rush attack per round. This attack does not provoke an attack of opportunity. Its [CMB](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-bonus) for bull rush checks uses your caster level in place of its base attack bonus, with a +8 bonus for its [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength) score (27), and a +1 bonus for being Large. The hand always moves with the opponent to push them back as far as possible. It has no movement limit for this purpose. Directing the spell to a new target is a move action. _Forceful hand _prevents the opponent from moving closer to you without first succeeding on a bull rush attack, moving both the _forceful _hand and the target closer to you. The _forceful hand_ can instead be directed to interpose itself, as _ [interposing hand](interposingHand.md#_interposing-hand)_ does.
