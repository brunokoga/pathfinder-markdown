Imbuing you with negative energy, this spell allows you to paralyze a single living humanoid for the duration of the spell with a successful melee touch attack.

A [paralyzed](../glossary.md#_paralyzed) subject exudes a carrion stench that causes all living creatures (except you) in a 10-foot-radius spread to become [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) ( [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) negates). A _ [neutralize poison](neutralizePoison.md#_neutralize-poison) _spell removes the effect from a [sickened](../glossary.md#_sickened) creature, and creatures immune to poison are unaffected by the stench. This is a poison effect.
