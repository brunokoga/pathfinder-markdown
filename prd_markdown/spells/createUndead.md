A much more potent spell than _ [animate dead](animateDead#_animate-dead), _this evil spell allows you to infuse a dead body with negative energy to create more powerful sorts of undead: ghouls, ghasts, mummies, and mohrgs. The type or types of undead you can create are based on your caster level, as shown on the table below.

| Caster Level | Undead Created |
| --- | --- |
| 11th or lower | Ghoul |
| 12th–14th | Ghast |
| 15th–17th | Mummy |
| 18th or higher | Mohrg |

You may create less powerful undead than your level would allow if you choose. Created undead are not automatically under the control of their animator. If you are capable of commanding undead, you may attempt to command the undead creature as it forms.

This spell must be cast at night.
