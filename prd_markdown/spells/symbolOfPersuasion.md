This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath#_symbol-of-death)_, except that all creatures within the radius of a _symbol of persuasion _instead become charmed by the caster (as the _ [charm monster](charmMonster#_charm-monster) _spell) for 1 hour per caster level.

Unlike _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath#_symbol-of-death)_, _symbol of persuasion _has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of persuasion _simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of persuasion _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 31 for _symbol of persuasion_.
