A_larm _creates a subtle ward on an area you select. Once the spell effect is in place, it thereafter sounds a mental or audible alarm each time a creature of Tiny or larger size enters the warded area or touches it. A creature that speaks the password (determined by you at the time of casting) does not set off the _alarm_. You decide at the time of casting whether the _alarm _will be mental or audible in nature.

_Mental Alarm_: A mental _alarm _alerts you (and only you) so long as you remain within 1 mile of the warded area. You note a single mental “ping” that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. A _ [silence](silence.md#_silence) _spell has no effect on a mental _alarm_.

_Audible Alarm_: An audible _alarm _produces the sound of a hand bell, and anyone within 60 feet of the warded area can hear it clearly. Reduce the distance by 10 feet for each interposing closed door and by 20 feet for each substantial interposing wall.

In quiet conditions, the ringing can be heard faintly as far as 180 feet away. The sound lasts for 1 round. Creatures within a _ [silence](silence.md#_silence) _spell cannot hear the ringing.

Ethereal or astral creatures do not trigger the _alarm_.

_Alarm _can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](permanency.md#_permanency) _spell.
