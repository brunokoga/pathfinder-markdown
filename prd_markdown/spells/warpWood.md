 **Warp Wood**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** 1 Small wooden object/level, all within a 20-ft. radius

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat#_will) negates (object); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary#_spell-resistance)** yes (object)

You cause wood to bend and warp, permanently destroying its straightness, form, and strength. A warped door springs open (or becomes stuck, requiring a [Strength](../gettingStarted#_strength) check to open, at your option). A boat or ship springs a leak. Warped ranged weapons are useless. A warped melee weapon causes a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

You may warp one Small or smaller object or its equivalent per caster level. A Medium object counts as two Small objects, a Large object as four, a Huge object as eight, a Gargantuan object as 16, and a Colossal object as 32.

Alternatively, you can unwarp wood (effectively warping it back to normal) with this spell. _ [Make whole](makeWhole#_make-whole)_, on the other hand, does no good in repairing a warped item.

You can combine multiple consecutive _warp wood _spells to warp (or unwarp) an object that is too large for you to warp with a single spell. Until the object is completely warped, it suffers no ill effects.
