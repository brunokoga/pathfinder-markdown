**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.html#_will) disbelief (if interacted with); **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You tap energy from the Plane of Shadow to cast a quasi-real, illusory version of a sorcerer or wizard evocation spell of 4th level or lower. Spells that deal damage have normal effects unless an affected creature succeeds on a [Will](../combat.html#_will) save. Each disbelieving creature takes only one-fifth damage from the attack. If the disbelieved attack has a special effect other than damage, that effect is one-fifth as strong (if applicable) or only 20% likely to occur. If recognized as a _shadow evocation, _a damaging spell deals only one-fifth (20%) damage. Regardless of the result of the save to disbelieve, an affected creature is also allowed any save (or [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)) that the spell being simulated allows, but the save DC is set according to _shadow evocation'_s level (5th) rather than the spell's normal level.

Nondamaging effects have normal effects except against those who disbelieve them. Against disbelievers, they have no effect.

Objects automatically succeed on their [Will](../combat.html#_will) saves against this spell.

**Shadow Evocation, Greater**
