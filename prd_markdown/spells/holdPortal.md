This spell magically holds shut a door, gate, window, or shutter of wood, metal, or stone. The magic affects the portal just as if it were securely closed and normally locked. A _ [knock](knock.html#_knock) _spell or a successful _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic) _spell can negate a _hold portal _spell.

Add 5 to the normal DC for forcing open a portal affected by this spell.
