A dim, blue glow surrounds the subjects, protecting them from attacks, granting them resistance to spells cast by chaotic creatures, and _slowing _chaotic creatures when they strike the subjects. This abjuration has four effects.

First, each warded creature gains a +4 deflection bonus to [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class) and a +4 resistance bonus on saves. Unlike _ [protection from chaos](protectionFromChaos.md#_protection-from-chaos)_, this benefit applies against all attacks, not just against attacks by chaotic creatures.

Second, a warded creature gains [spell resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance) 25 against chaotic spells and spells cast by chaotic creatures.

Third, the abjuration protects you from possession and mental influence, just as _ [protection from chaos](protectionFromChaos.md#_protection-from-chaos) _does.

Finally, if a chaotic creature succeeds on a melee attack against a warded creature, the attacker is _slowed _( [Will](../combat.md#_will) save negates, as the _ [slow](slow.md#_slow) _spell, but against _shield of law_'s save DC).
