 **Plane Shift**

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a forked metal rod attuned to the plane of travel)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched, or up to eight willing creatures joining hands

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** [Will](../combat.md#_will) negates; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.md#_spell-resistance)** yes

You move yourself or some other creature to another plane of existence or alternate dimension. If several willing persons link hands in a circle, as many as eight can be affected by the _plane shift _at the same time. Precise accuracy as to a particular arrival location on the intended plane is nigh impossible. From the Material Plane, you can reach any other plane, though you appear 5 to 500 miles (5d%) from your intended destination. _Plane shift _transports creatures instantaneously and then ends. The creatures need to find other means if they are to travel back (including casting _plane shift_ again).
