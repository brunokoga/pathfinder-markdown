**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorus, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 5,000 gp)

This spell functions like _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, except that every creature within 60 feet of a _symbol of weakness _instead suffers crippling weakness that deals 3d6 points of [Strength](../gettingStarted.md#_strength) damage.

Unlike _ [symbol of death](symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, _symbol of weakness _has no hit point limit; once triggered, a _symbol of weakness _simply remains active for 10 minutes per caster level. A creature can only be affected by this symbol once.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of weakness _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 32 for _symbol of weakness_.
