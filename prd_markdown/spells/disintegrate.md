**Components** V, S, M/DF (a lodestone and a pinch of dust)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

A thin, green ray springs from your pointing finger. You must make a successful ranged touch attack to hit. Any creature struck by the ray takes 2d6 points of damage per caster level (to a maximum of 40d6). Any creature reduced to 0 or fewer hit points by this spell is entirely disintegrated, leaving behind only a trace of fine dust. A disintegrated creature's equipment is unaffected.

When used against an object, the ray simply disintegrates as much as a 10-foot cube of nonliving matter. Thus, the spell disintegrates only part of any very large object or structure targeted. The ray affects even objects constructed entirely of force, such as _ [forceful hand](forcefulHand.md#_forceful-hand) _or a _ [wall of force](wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force)_, but not magical effects such as a _ [globe of invulnerability](globeOfInvulnerability.md#_globe-of-invulnerability) _or an _ [antimagic field](antimagicField.md#_antimagic-field)._

A creature or object that makes a successful [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) save is partially affected, taking only 5d6 points of damage. If this damage reduces the creature or object to 0 or fewer hit points, it is entirely disintegrated.

Only the first creature or object struck can be affected; that is, the ray affects only one target per casting.
