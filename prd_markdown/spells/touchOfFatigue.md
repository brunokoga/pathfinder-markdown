 **Touch of Fatigue**

**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 0

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a drop of sweat)

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) negates; **[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** yes

You channel negative energy through your touch, fatiguing the target. You must succeed on a touch attack to strike a target. The subject is immediately [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued) for the spell's duration.

This spell has no effect on a creature that is already [fatigued](../glossary.html#_fatigued). Unlike with normal fatigue, the effect ends as soon as the spell's duration expires.
