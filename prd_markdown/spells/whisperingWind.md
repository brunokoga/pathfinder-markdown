You send a message or sound on the wind to a designated spot. The _whispering wind _travels to a specific location within range that is familiar to you, provided that it can find a way to the location. A _whispering wind _is as gentle and unnoticed as a zephyr until it reaches the location. It then delivers its whisper-quiet message or other sound. Note that the message is delivered regardless of whether anyone is present to hear it. The wind then dissipates.

You can prepare the spell to bear a message of no more than 25 words, cause the spell to deliver other sounds for 1 round, or merely have the _whispering wind _seem to be a faint stirring of the air. You can likewise cause the _whispering wind _to move as slowly as 1 mile per hour or as quickly as 1 mile per 10 minutes.

When the spell reaches its objective, it swirls and remains in place until the message is delivered. As with _magic mouth, whispering wind _cannot speak verbal components, use command words, or activate magical effects.
