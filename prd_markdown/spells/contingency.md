 **Contingency**

**School** evocation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** at least 10 minutes; see text

**Components** V, S, M (quicksilver and an eyelash of a spell-using creature), F (ivory statuette of you worth 1,500 gp)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 day/level (D) or until discharged

You can place another spell upon your person so that it comes into effect under some condition you dictate when casting _contingency_. The _contingency _spell and the companion spell are cast at the same time. The 10-minute casting time is the minimum total for both castings; if the companion spell has a casting time longer than 10 minutes, use that instead. You must pay any costs associated with the companion spell when you cast _contingency._

The spell to be brought into effect by the _contingency _must be one that affects your person and be of a spell level no higher than one-third your caster level (rounded down, maximum 6th level).

The conditions needed to bring the spell into effect must be clear, although they can be general. In all cases, the _contingency _immediately brings into effect the companion spell, the latter being “cast” instantaneously when the prescribed circumstances occur. If complicated or convoluted conditions are prescribed, the whole spell combination (_contingency _and the companion magic) may fail when triggered. The companion spell occurs based solely on the stated conditions, regardless of whether you want it to.

You can use only one _contingency _spell at a time; if a second is cast, the first one (if still active) is dispelled.
