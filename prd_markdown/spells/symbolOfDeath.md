This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon a surface. When triggered, a _symbol of death _kills one or more creatures within 60 feet of the symbol (treat as a burst) whose combined total current hit points do not exceed 150. The _symbol of death _affects the closest creatures first, skipping creatures with too many hit points to affect. Once triggered, the _symbol _becomes active and glows, lasting for 10 minutes per caster level or until it has affected 150 hit points' worth of creatures, whichever comes first. A creature that enters the area while the _symbol of death _is active is subject to its effect, whether or not that creature was in the area when it was triggered. A creature need save against the _symbol _only once as long as it remains within the area, though if it leaves the area and returns while the _symbol _is still active, it must save again.

Until it is triggered, the _symbol of death _is inactive (though visible and legible at a distance of 60 feet). To be effective, a _symbol of death _must always be placed in plain sight and in a prominent location. Covering or hiding the rune renders the _symbol of death _ineffective, unless a creature removes the covering, in which case the _symbol of death _works normally.

As a default, a _symbol of death _is triggered whenever a creature does one or more of the following, as you select: looks at the rune; reads the rune; touches the rune; passes over the rune; or passes through a portal bearing the rune. Regardless of the trigger method or methods chosen, a creature more than 60 feet from a symbol of death can't trigger it (even if it meets one or more of the triggering conditions, such as reading the rune). Once the spell is cast, a _symbol of death_'s triggering conditions cannot be changed.

In this case, “reading” the rune means any attempt to study it, identify it, or fathom its meaning. Throwing a cover over a _symbol of death _to render it inoperative triggers it if the symbol reacts to touch. You can't use a _symbol of death _offensively; for instance, a touch-triggered _symbol of death_ remains untriggered if an item bearing the _symbol of death _is used to touch a creature. Likewise, a _symbol of death _cannot be placed on a weapon and set to activate when the weapon strikes a foe.

You can also set special triggering limitations of your own. These can be as simple or elaborate as you desire. Special conditions for triggering a _symbol of death _can be based on a creature's name, identity, or alignment, but otherwise must be based on observable actions or qualities. Intangibles such as level, class, HD, and hit points don't qualify.

When scribing a _symbol of death_, you can specify a password or phrase that prevents a creature using it from triggering the symbol's effect_. _Anyone using the password remains immune to that particular rune's effects so long as the creature remains within 60 feet of the rune. If the creature leaves the radius and returns later, it must use the password again.

You also can attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of death, _but doing this can extend the casting time. Attuning one or two creatures takes negligible time, and attuning a small group (as many as 10 creatures) extends the casting time to 1 hour. Attuning a large group (as many as 25 creatures) takes 24 hours. Attuning larger groups takes an additional 24 hours per 25 creatures. Any creature attuned to a _symbol of death _cannot trigger it and is immune to its effects, even if within its radius when it is triggered. You are automatically considered attuned to your own _symbols of death_, and thus always ignore the effects and cannot inadvertently trigger them.

_ [Read magic](readMagic.md#_read-magic) _allows you to identify a _symbol _with a Spellcraft check (DC 10 + the _symbol's _spell level). Of course, if the _symbol _is set to be triggered by reading it, this will trigger the symbol.

A _symbol of death _can be removed by a successful _ [dispel magic](dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic) _targeted solely on the rune. An _erase _spell has no effect on a _symbol of death. _Destruction of the surface where a _symbol of death _is inscribed destroys the _symbol _but also triggers it.

_Symbol of death _can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](permanency.md#_permanency) _spell. A permanent _symbol of death _that is disabled or has affected its maximum number of hit points becomes inactive for 10 minutes, but then can be triggered again as normal.

_Note_: Magic traps such as _symbol of death _are hard to detect and disable. While any character can use Perception to find a symbol, only a character with the trapfinding class feature can use Disable Device to disarm it. The DC in each case is 25 + spell level, or 33 for _symbol of death_.
