 **Energy Drain**

**School** necromancy; **Level** cleric 9, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Saving Throw** [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) partial; see text for _ [enervation](enervation.md#_enervation)_

This spell functions like _ [enervation](enervation.md#_enervation), _except that the creature struck gains 2d4 temporary [negative levels](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels). Twenty-four hours after gaining them, the subject must make a [Fortitude](../combat.md#_fortitude) saving throw (DC = _energy drain _spell's save DC) for each negative level. If the save succeeds, that [negative level](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)is removed. If it fails, that [negative level](../glossary.md#_energy-drain-and-negative-levels)becomes permanent.

An undead creature struck by the ray gains 2d4 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for 1 hour.
