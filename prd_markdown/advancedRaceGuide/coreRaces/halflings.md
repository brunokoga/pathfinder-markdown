# Halflings 

Optimistic and cheerful by nature, blessed with uncanny luck, and driven by a powerful wanderlust, halflings make up for their short stature with an abundance of bravado and curiosity. At once excitable and easy-going, halflings like to keep an even temper and a steady eye on opportunity, and are not as prone to violent or emotional outbursts as some of the more volatile races. Even in the jaws of catastrophe, halflings almost never lose their sense of humor. Their ability to find humor in the absurd, no matter how dire the situation, often allows halflings to distance themselves ever so slightly from the dangers that surround them. This sense of detachment can also help shield them from terrors that might immobilize their allies.

Halflings are inveterate opportunists. They firmly believe they can turn any situation to their advantage, and sometimes gleefully leap into trouble without any solid plan to extricate themselves if things go awry. Often unable to physically defend themselves from the rigors of the world, they know when to bend with the wind and when to hide away. Yet halflings' curiosity often overwhelms their good sense, leading to poor decisions and narrow escapes. While harsh experience sometimes teaches halflings a measure of caution, it rarely makes them completely lose faith in their luck or stop believing that the universe, in some strange way, exists for their entertainment and would never really allow them to come to harm.

Though their curiosity drives them to seek out new places and experiences, halflings possess a strong sense of hearth and home, often spending above their means to enhance the comforts of domestic life. Without a doubt, halflings enjoy luxury and comfort, but they have equally strong reasons to make their homes a showcase. Halflings consider this urge to devote time, money, and energy toward improving their dwellings a sign of both respect for strangers and affection for their loved ones. Whether for their own blood kin, cherished friends, or honored guests, halflings make their homes beautiful in order to express their feelings toward those they welcome inside. Even traveling halflings typically decorate their wagons or carry a few cherished keepsakes to adorn their campsites.

**Physical Description** : Halflings rise to a humble height of 3 feet. They prefer to walk barefoot, leading the bottoms of their feet to become roughly calloused. Tufts of thick, curly hair warm the tops of their broad, tanned feet. Their skin tends toward a rich cinnamon color and their hair toward light shades of brown. A halfling's ears are pointed, but proportionately not much larger than those of a human.

Halflings prefer simple and modest clothing. Though willing and able to dress up if the situation demands it, their racial urge to remain quietly in the background makes them rather conservative dressers in most situations. Halfling entertainers, on the other hand, make their livings by drawing attention, and tend to go overboard with gaudy and flashy costumes.

**Society** : Rather than place their faith in empires or great causes, many halflings prefer to focus on the simpler and humbler virtues of their families and local communities. Halflings claim no cultural homeland and control no settlements larger than rural assemblies of free towns. Most often, they dwell at the knees of their human cousins in human cities, eking out livings as they can from the scraps of larger societies. Many halflings lead perfectly fulfilling lives in the shadow of their larger neighbors, while some prefer more nomadic lives, traveling the world and experiencing all it has to offer.

Halflings rely on customs and traditions to maintain their own culture. They have an extensive oral history filled with important stories about folk heroes who exemplify particular halfling virtues, but otherwise see little purpose in studying history in and of itself. Given a choice between a pointless truth and a useful fable, halflings almost always opt for the fable. This tendency helps to explain at least something of the famous halfling adaptability. Halflings look to the future and find it very easy to cast off the weight of ancient grudges or obligations that drag down so many other races.

**Relations** : A typical halfling prides himself on his ability to go unnoticed by other races—a trait that allows many halflings to excel at thievery and trickery. Most halflings know full well the stereotypical view other races take of them as a result, and go out of their way to be forthcoming and friendly to the bigger races when they're not trying to go unnoticed. They get along fairly well with gnomes, although most halflings regard these eccentric creatures with a hefty dose of caution. Halflings respect elves and dwarves, but these races often live in remote regions far from the comforts of civilization that halflings enjoy, thus limiting opportunities for interaction. By and large, only half-orcs are shunned by halflings, for their great size and violent natures are a bit too intimidating for most halflings to cope with.

Halflings coexist well with humans as a general rule, but since some of the more aggressive human societies value halflings as slaves, they try not to grow too complacent. Halflings strongly value their freedom, especially the ability to travel in search of new experiences and the autonomy this requires. However, practical and flexible as always, enslaved halflings seldom fight back directly against their masters. When possible, they wait for the perfect opportunity and then simply slip away. Sometimes, if enslaved for long enough, halflings even come to adopt their owners as their new families. Though they still dream of escape and liberty, these halflings also make the best of their lives.

**Alignment and Religion** : Halflings are loyal to their friends and families, but since they dwell in a world dominated by races twice as large as themselves, they have come to grips with the fact that sometimes they need to scrape and scrounge for survival. Most halflings are neutral as a result. Though they usually make a show of respecting the laws and endorsing the prejudices of their communities, halflings place an even greater emphasis on the innate common sense of the individual. When a halfling disagrees with society at large, he will do what he thinks is best.

Always practical, halflings frequently worship the deity most favored by their larger and more powerful neighbors. The goddess of both luck and travel seems a natural fit for most halflings and offering her a quick prayer every now and then is only common sense.

**Adventurers** : Their inherent luck coupled with their insatiable wanderlust makes halflings ideal candidates for lives of adventure. Though perfectly willing to pocket any valuables they come across, halflings often care more for the new experiences adventuring brings them than for any material reward. Halflings tend to view money as a means of making their lives easier and more comfortable, not as an end in and of itself.

Other such vagabonds often put up with this curious race in hopes that some of their mystical luck will rub off. Halflings see nothing wrong with encouraging this belief, not just in their traveling companions, but also in the larger world. Many try to use their reputation for luck to haggle for reduced fare when traveling by ship or caravan, or even for an overnight stay at an inn. They meet with mixed success, but there are just enough stories circulating about the good fortune that befalls people traveling with halflings to give even the most skeptical pause. Of course, some suspect that halflings deliberately spread these reports for just that reason.

# Alternate Racial Rules

Halflings are naturally blessed with good luck and adaptability to their surroundings. The following rules correspond with these attributes and may be used with any halfling character.

## Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing halfling racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Adaptable Luck** : Some halflings have greater control over their innate luck. This ability gives them more options for how they can apply their good fortune from day to day, but also narrows its scope. Three times per day, a halfling can gain a +2 luck bonus on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check. If halflings choose to use the ability before they make the roll or check, they gain the full +2 bonus; if they choose to do so afterward, they only gain a +1 bonus. Using adaptive luck in this way is not an action. This racial trait replaces halfling luck.

**Craven** : While most halflings are fearless, some are skittish, making them particularly alert. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on initiative checks and a +1 bonus on attack rolls when flanking. They take a –2 penalty on saves against fear effects and gain no benefit from morale bonuses on such saves. When affected by a fear effect, their base speed increases by 10 feet and they gain a +1 dodge bonus to Armor Class. This racial trait replaces fearless and halfling luck.

**Fleet of Foot** : Some halflings are quicker than their kin but less cautious. Halflings with this racial trait move at normal speed and have a base speed of 30 feet. This racial trait replaces slow speed and sure-footed.

**Ingratiating** : Halflings often survive at the whims of larger, more aggressive races. Because of this, they go out of their way to make themselves more useful, or at least entertaining, to larger folk. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on skill checks for a single [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) skill of their choice, and [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) is always a class skill for them. They also gain a +2 bonus on [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) and [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) checks. This racial trait replaces keen senses and sure-footed.

**Low Blow** : Some halflings train extensively in the art of attacking larger creatures. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus on critical confirmation rolls against opponents larger than themselves. This racial trait replaces keen senses.

**Outrider** : Some halflings specialize in mounted combat. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) and [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) checks. This racial trait replaces sure-footed.

**Polyglot** : Some halflings, especially those who spend a lot of time traveling, develop a talent for learning new languages. These halflings gain a +2 racial bonus on [Linguistics](skills/linguistics#_linguistics) checks, and it is always a class skill for them. Halflings with this racial trait also begin play with the ability to speak Common, Halfling, and any one other language of their choice (except for secret languages, such as Druidic) in addition to bonus languages due to high Intelligence. They still gain the normal list of halfling bonus languages. This racial trait replaces keen senses and alters the halfling language racial trait.

**Practicality** : Halflings value hard work and common sense. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 bonus on any one [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) or [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) skill, as well as on [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) checks and saves against illusions. This racial trait replaces fearless and sure-footed.

**Shiftless** : Halflings have a reputation for larceny and guile—and sometimes it's well deserved. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) and [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) checks, and [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) is always a class skill for them. This racial trait replaces sure-footed.

**Swift as Shadows** : Halflings possess incredible stealth even while moving through obstructed areas. Halflings with this racial trait reduce the penalty for using [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) while moving by 5, and reduce the [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) check penalty for sniping by 10. This racial trait replaces sure-footed.

**Underfoot** : Halflings must train hard to effectively fight bigger opponents. Halflings with this racial trait gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against foes larger than themselves and a +1 bonus on Reflex saving throws to avoid trample attacks. This racial trait replaces halfling luck.

**Wanderlust** : Halflings love travel and maps. Halflings with this racial trait receive a +2 bonus on [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (geography) and [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) checks. When casting spells or using abilities that provide or enhance movement, halflings treat their caster level as +1 higher than normal. This racial trait replaces fearless and halfling luck.

**Warslinger** : Halflings are experts at the use of the sling. Halflings with this racial trait can reload a sling as a free action. Reloading a sling still requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. This racial trait replaces sure-footed.

## Racial Subtypes

You can combine various alternate racial traits to create halfling subraces or variant races, such as the following.

**Avenging** : Unlike most halflings, members of this subtype actively look for trouble in their quest to avenge slights and wrongdoings. Whether resisting a local bully, monster, or troops of an oppressive ruler, halfling warriors of this secret subculture don masks and strike back on behalf of their community. These halflings have the low blow, underfoot, and warslinger alternate racial traits.

**Nomadic** : These halflings were born on the road and most follow it until the end of their days. They travel fast and light and never miss a chance for either profit or adventure. These halflings have the fleet-footed, polyglot, and wanderlust alternate racial traits.

**Slave Born** : These halflings come from lineages that have spent countless generations as property. Though usually free themselves, the weight of slavery still bears down on their souls, making them eager to please and prone to sudden fits of fear. These halflings have the craven and ingratiating alternate racial traits.

## Favored Class Options

The following favored options are available to all halflings who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the class reward.

**Alchemist** : Add one extract formula from the alchemist's list to the alchemist's formula book. This formula must be at least one level below the highest formula level the alchemist can create.

**Rogue** : Choose a weapon from the following list: sling, dagger, or any weapon with "halfling" in its name. Add a +1/2 bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls with that weapon (maximum bonus +4). This bonus does not stack with [Critical Focus](feats#_critical-focus).

# Racial Archetypes & Orders

The following racial order and racial archetypes are available to halflings.

## Community Guardian (Oracle)

The community guardian is chosen to protect and succor the weak and innocent within her community. Her calling also allows her to draw upon and focus the collective will in order to achieve those goals. A community guardian has the following class features.

**Alignment** : Any good.

**Recommended Mysteries** : ancestor, life, lore, nature.

**Class Skills** : A community guardian adds [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (local), [Linguistics](skills/linguistics#_linguistics), [Perception](skills/perception#_perception), and [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) to her list of class skills. These replace the additional class skills from her mystery.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [bless water](spells/blessWater#_bless-water)_ (2nd), _ [consecrate](spells/consecrate#_consecrate)_ (4th), _ [remove disease](spells/removeDisease#_remove-disease)_ (6th), _ [hallow](spells/hallow#_hallow)_ (10th), _ [heroes' feast](spells/heroesFeast#_heroes-feast)_ (12th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells from these levels.

**Revelations** : A community guardian must take the following revelations at the listed levels.

> _Spirit of Community (Ex)_: As a move action, you call upon the spirits of community. For the next round, you grant every ally within 30 feet a +1 competence bonus on a single skill check (of the ally's choice) that it makes before the end of this revelation's duration. Furthermore, allies within 30 feet can, as a free action, choose to forgo this bonus, and instead grant a single ally a +1 increase to its competence bonus granted by this ability (maximum +5). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier. You must take this revelation at 1st level.
> 
> _Renewing Radiance (Su)_: Once per day you can produce a burst of swirling white light that provides a measure of protection and renewal to allies within 30 feet for 1 round. On their turn, the allies can choose either to gain a +1 sacred bonus to AC for 1 round or to heal a number of hit points equal to 1d6 + your Charisma bonus (their choice). If an ally is dying, it is stabilized instead. At 7th level, the bonus to AC increases to +2, and the healing increases to 2d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points, and at 14th level the bonus to AC increases to +3, and the healing increases to 3d6 + your Charisma bonus hit points. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.
## Filcher (Rogue)

A filcher steals valuables without their owners even realizing it. Whether cutting purses in the midst of combat or replacing prized items with fakes under the noses of their owners, the filcher is the master of the quick and quiet steal. A filcher has the following class features.

**Quicker than the Eye (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a filcher develops an amazingly swift and delicate touch. When she uses [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand), creatures take a penalty on their [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks to notice the attempt equal to half the filcher's class level. The filcher also subtracts her class level from the normal –20 penalty when attempting to make a [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) check as a move action instead of as a standard action. Lastly, the filcher can withdraw an object hidden on her person, including a weapon, as a move action instead of the usual standard action. This ability replaces evasion.

**Rummage (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a filcher learns how to assess the value of items at the quickest glance. She can even make startlingly accurate guesses about particular items merely by observing the bulges they make in pouches, backpacks, or similar containers. She gains a +1 bonus on [Appraise](skills/appraise#_appraise) checks and an additional +1 bonus every three levels thereafter.

As a swift action, a filcher can make an [Appraise](skills/appraise#_appraise) check in order to determine the relative value of each object carried by her target (DC = 10 + 1 for every object the filcher is trying to ascertain the relative value of). Though she never learns the actual prices of items when using rummage, she does gain enough information to list these items in order, from the most valuable to the least valuable. She can, by taking a –20 penalty on the check, add to this assessment any items carried by her target that she cannot see. This ability replaces trap sense +1, +2, +3, +4, +5, and +6.

**Filch (Ex)** : At 4th level, a filcher learns how pluck items off her opponents even in combat. She gains [Improved Steal](advanced/advancedFeats#_improved-steal) as a bonus feat and can use her [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) bonus instead of her CMB when performing a steal combat maneuver. If the filcher gains bonuses on combat maneuver checks from any feats, spells, magic items, or similar effects, they are added to the [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) bonus when using the steal maneuver. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Superior Filching (Ex)** : At 8th level, a filcher becomes a master at separating owners from their property. She gains [Greater Steal](advanced/advancedFeats#_greater-steal) as a bonus feat, and opponents do not gain a +5 bonus to their CMD when she tries to remove items fastened to them. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rogue Talents** : The following rogue talents complement the filcher archetype: fast stealth, slow reactions; fast fingers, fast getaway ; black market connections, deft palm.

**Advanced Talents** : The following advanced rogue talents complement the filcher archetype: skill mastery; fast tumble ; weapon snatcher.

## Order of the Paw (Cavalier)

Only dog- or wolf-riding halflings are eligible to join this order of cavaliers. When they do, they pledge to defend halflings, halfling settlements, and other innocent folks by patrolling the wilderness and seeking out possible threats to both individuals and whole communities. These cavaliers hunt down potential danger with a ruthless efficiency and determination that non-halflings find surprising and even somewhat alarming.

**Edicts** : The cavalier must strive to protect his community from rampaging monsters and fearsome conquers alike. His first priority is to aid halfling communities, but he also is sworn to protect those who cannot protect themselves from such threats in the wild. He must never take any action that would put a halfling community or an innocent creature in jeopardy. An order of the paw cavalier must take either a wolf or a dog as his mount.

**Challenge** : Whenever an order of the paw cavalier issues a challenge, his mount gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC as long it is threatening the target of the cavalier's challenge and the cavalier is riding the mount. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.

**Skills** : An order of the paw cavalier adds [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (nature) and [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) to his list of class skills. He can make [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (nature) checks untrained. Also, an order of the paw cavalier is adept at following tracks while mounted, using his mount's speed rather than his own to determine the penalty for tracking while moving, whether he is mounted or not.

**Order Abilities** : A cavalier belonging to the order of the paw gains the following abilities as he increases in level.

> _Danger Ward (Ex)_: At 2nd level, the cavalier can ready his allies for impending danger. As a standard action, he can ready all allies within 30 feet of the danger ahead, granting a bonus on a single type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex or Will) that he chooses when he grants this boon. At any point in the next minute, when these allies fail a saving throw of that type, they can choose to reroll the saving throw with a +4 competence bonus as an immediate action, but must take the results of the reroll even if it is worse. He can use this ability up to three times per day, once for each type of saving throw.
> 
> _Canine Ferocity (Ex)_: At 8th level, when the cavalier uses his wolf or dog mount to perform a bull rush or overrun maneuver, the mount is considered to be one size category larger for the purposes of determining the size of creature it is maneuvering against and the mount's CMB. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: [Mounted Combat](feats#_mounted-combat), Ride-By Attack, [Skill Focus](feats#_skill-focus) ( [Ride](skills/ride#_ride)), Spirited Charge, Trample, or Unseat. He must qualify for the feat selected.
> 
> _Giant Slayer (Ex)_: At 15th level, when the cavalier hits the target of his challenge with a melee attack, and that target is at least two size categories larger than the cavalier, he gains a bonus on damage rolls equal to 1/2 his cavalier level. This damage is multiplied on a critical hit.
## Underfoot Adept (Monk)

An underfoot adept turns his diminutive stature and unorthodox footwork into a powerful weapon. Effortlessly moving across the battlefield, he ducks under the legs of larger creatures and then topples them with surprising attacks. An underfoot adept has the following class features.

**Underfoot Grace (Ex)** : At 1st level, an underfoot adept uses his size and grace to avoid the attacks of those he passes. When using the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) skill to avoid attacks of opportunity by moving through a threatened area or an enemy's space, he only takes a –5 penalty when doing so at full speed, instead of the normal –10 penalty. This ability replaces the bonus feat gained at 1st level.

**Underfoot Trip (Ex)** : At 1st level, an underfoot adept learns a number of maneuvers and grabs that can cause even the largest opponents to stumble and fall. He gains Improved Trip as a bonus feat, even if he does not meet the requirements. At 4th level, and every four levels thereafter, he acts as if he is one size larger for the purposes of determining the maximum size of creatures he can trip and when determining his CMB and CMD for purposes of a trip combat maneuver. This ability replaces stunning fist.

**Improved Underfoot Grace (Ex)** : At 5th level, an underfoot adept's ability to avoid attacks of opportunity against those he passes improves. When using the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) skill to avoid attacks of opportunity, while moving through a threatened area or through an enemy's space, he takes no penalty when doing so at full speed. This ability replaces high jump.

# New Racial Rules

The following options are available to halflings. At the GM's discretion, other appropriate races may also make use of some of these.

## Halfling Equipment

Halflings have access to the following equipment.

**Alchemical Preserves** : Each small tin of this specially treated jam contains just enough of the gooey stuff to provide a halfling with a single serving of revitalizing nourishment. While any creature can eat these preserves as a standard action, it only affects halflings in a beneficial way. Halflings who eat the preserves recover from fatigue. Non-halflings who eat alchemical preserves become sickened for 1 round.

**Billow Cape** : This silk cape is constructed of many carefully arranged overlapping layers that are loosely stitched together. When exposed to a sudden influx of air, like that caused by falling, the cloak unfolds like a crude parachute. When falling, a creature wearing a billow cape is treated as if he had deliberately jumped from the height. When worn in areas of strong wind or greater, a billow cape hampers movement. In such wind conditions, the wearer treats all terrain as difficult terrain and takes a –4 penalty on [Fly](skills/fly#_fly) checks. Because of the strange and somewhat fragile construction of this cape, only Small or smaller billow capes function properly. Larger billow capes take all the penalties resulting from high winds, but grant none of the benefits when the wearer falls.

**Halfling Jugglesticks** : This group of four brightly colored sticks is adorned with colorful streamers that can be juggled and manipulated to create displays and patterns. Halflings use them to even greater effect, gaining a +2 circumstance bonus on [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (comedy) checks.

**Roar Cord** : This thin length of rope has many oddly shaped bits of hollow metal fixed along its length. As a standard action, a creature can swing a roar cord over its head to generate a variety of eerie noises. For the next round, any creature within 60 feet of the roar cord takes a –2 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks that rely on sound and a –1 penalty on saving throws against fear effects. The roar cord can be used as a bardic instrument (string instrument) that grants the bard a +2 bonus on [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) checks when using the countersong bardic performance.

[Halfling Equipment]
| Item | Cost | Weight | Craft DC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Alchemical preserves | 50 gp | — | 20 |
| Billow cape | 100 gp | 4 lbs. | — |
| Halfling jugglesticks | 25 gp | 1 lb. | — |
| Roar cord | 15 gp | 1 lb. | — |

**Prerequisites** : Base attack bonus +4, halfling, low-blow racial trait.

**Benefit** : Your bonus to confirm critical hits against opponents larger than yourself improves to +2. Furthermore, once per day, after you fail to hit with a critical hit confirmation roll, you can reroll the confirmation roll, but must take the new result even if it is worse.

### Lucky Healer 

Your luck allows you to draw from magical healing far more efficiently than most.

**Prerequisites** : Adaptive luck racial trait, halfling.

**Benefit** : Spend a use of your adaptive luck racial trait to reroll the damage healed from a single magical healing effect (such as a spell with "cure" in the title or channel energy). You regain a number of hit points equal to the new roll or the original roll, whichever is greater. Other creatures healed by the effect do not gain this benefit.

### Lucky Strike (Combat)

Your luck increases the potency of your weapon attacks.

**Prerequisites** : Base attack bonus +5, adaptive luck racial trait, halfling.

**Benefit** : Spend a use of your adaptive luck racial trait to reroll the damage from a single weapon attack. You deal damage equal to the new damage roll, or the original roll, whichever is greater.

### Risky Striker (Combat)

You can make yourself a little more vulnerable to larger creatures in order to land a devastating blow.

**Prerequisites** : Base attack bonus +1, halfling.

**Benefit** : You can choose to take a –1 penalty to AC to gain a +2 bonus on melee damage rolls against creatures two or more size categories larger than you. When your base attack bonus reaches +4 and every four levels thereafter, the damage increases by 2. The bonus damage is multiplied in the case of a critical hit. You can only choose to use this feat when you declare that you are making an attack action or a full-attack action with a melee weapon. The effects last until your next turn.

### Sure and Fleet

You are both fast and careful.

### Surprise Strike (Combat) 

You actually seem to do more damage when frantically trying to avoid your enemies.

**Prerequisites** : Cautious Fighter, Desperate Swing, base attack bonus +6, halfling.

**Benefit** : Once per day, when fighting defensively or making an attack of opportunity while taking the total defense action with the Desperate Swing feat, you take no penalty on the attack roll.

### Uncanny Defense (Combat)

Your instinct for self-preservation gives you many advantages.

**Prerequisites** : Cautious Fighter, base attack bonus +3, halfling.

**Benefit** : While fighting defensively or taking the total defense action, you gain a bonus on your Reflex saving throws and to your CMD equal to 1/2 of the dodge bonus to AC you gained from taking that action.

## Halfling Magic Items

Halflings have access to the following magic items.

Book of Marvelous Recipes

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th

**Slot** none; **Price** 28,800; **Weight** 3 lbs.

Description

The pages of this thick and travel-worn leather book visibly rewrite themselves as a reader flips through them, creating a number of delicious recipes that seem to anticipate the current craving or culinary desires of the reader. The recipes can aid the reader in creating such dishes, allowing him to use the [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) (cook) skill untrained, or granting a +4 competence bonus on such checks if the reader is trained in that skill.

Furthermore, once per day, this book can be used to enhance a meal the reader is cooking. When used in this way, it grants the meal being cooked the effects of a _ [heroes' feast](spells/heroesFeast#_heroes-feast)_ spell (caster level 11th).

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [heroes' feast](spells/heroesFeast#_heroes-feast)_, the creator must have at least 4 ranks in [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) (cook); **Cost** 14,400 gp

Escape Dust

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 300 gp; **Weight** —

Description

When a handful of this coarse, crystalline powder is thrown at a single creature, it circles around that creature and disrupts its ability to attack and see. Using this dust requires a ranged touch attack by its user (with a range increment of 5 feet), but doing so does not provoke attacks of opportunity. On a hit, the target is dazzled and cannot make attacks of opportunity or immediate actions for 1 round.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [glitterdust](spells/glitterdust#_glitterdust)_; **Cost** 150 gp

Quickfingers Gloves

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** hands; **Price** 2,500 gp; **Weight** —

Description

These dark-colored, skin-tight gloves are typically made of either supple calfskin or silk. A wearer of these gloves with at least 1 rank in [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) can perform such a check as a move action by taking a –10 penalty on the check rather than the normal –20. Both gloves must be worn for the magic to be effective.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [cat's grace](spells/catSGrace#_cat-s-grace)_,_ [haste](spells/haste#_haste)_; **Cost** 1,250 gp

Solidsmoke Pipeweed

**Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** —

Description

When smoked in any pipe, this pinch of magical tobacco produces a languid, milky-white smoke that the smoker can transform into useful objects. A halfling who puffs on the pipe as a full-round action can shape the smoke into an object weighing no more than 5 pounds and having a maximum volume of 1 cubic foot. The halfling can, on following rounds, spend additional full-round actions to increase the object's weight by 2 additional pounds and its volume by another cubic foot. The halfling must succeed at an appropriate [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) check to make a complex item. If the halfling stops puffing on her pipe for any reason before she finishes creating the object, the figure in the smoke collapses and her pipe is extinguished. Objects created by _solidsmoke pipeweed_ last for 24 hours before fading away into vapor. Objects created by the pipeweed have the same hardness, hit points, and other qualities as manufactured objects of their type, but look smoky and indistinct. Each pinch of _solidsmoke pipeweed_ is sufficient for 3 full rounds of smoking. A single larger item must be created with a single pinch of _solidsmoke pipeweed_, so any item created with this pipeweed can't be larger than 9 pounds and 3 cubic feet.

A halfling cannot create an object designed to exactly duplicate or replace another specific object. For instance, while she could create a smoky lock with its own key, she could not puff smoke into an existing keyhole and then create a key that would open that particular lock.

This smoke is caustic and chokes non-halflings. It grants non-halflings no benefits, and each time they spend a standard action to smoke the pipeweed, they are sickened for 1 round.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [minor creation](spells/minorCreation#_minor-creation)_, creator must be a halfling; **Cost** 500 gp

**Slot** none; **Price** 6,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

Description

This translucent sphere of iron-hard glass changes shape to match its bearer's holy symbol within an hour of coming into her possession. After that transformation is complete, when this symbol is used by a halfling with the luck or adaptable luck racial trait to channel energy in order to heal, it also grants those healed a +1 luck bonus on saving throws for a number of rounds equal to the number of dice healed by the channel energy.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [divine favor](spells/divineFavor#_divine-favor)_, the creator must be a halfling; **Cost** 3,000 gp

## Halfling Spells

Halflings have access to the following spells.

Blessing of Luck and Resolve

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** one living creature touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D), special see below

A favored blessing of halfling clerics, this spell grants its target a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear effects. If the target has the fearless racial trait, it is immune to fear instead. If the target fails a saving throw against fear, it can end the spell as an immediate action to reroll the save with a +4 morale bonus, and must take the new result, even if it is worse.

Blessing of Luck and Resolve, Mass

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 6, inquisitor 6, paladin 4

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions like _blessing of luck and resolve_, except that it affects multiple creatures.

Escaping Ward

**School** abjuration; **Level** bard 2, inquisitor 2, magus 2, ranger 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

This ward grants you extra maneuverability when you avoid attacks against larger foes. While affected by this spell, when you are attacked and missed by a creature that is at least one size category larger than you, you can, as an immediate action, move up to 5 feet away from the attacking creature. You can increase this movement by 5 feet for every 5 caster levels. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity.

Fearsome Duplicate

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 3, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** monstrously distorted duplicate of you

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief (if interacted with); **Spell Resistance** yes

You create a larger and far more menacing version of yourself that you can send forth, manipulate like a puppet, and use to interact with others. You can make the duplicate up to two size categories larger than you are and determine a theme as to how it alters your original appearance. However, this duplicate always retains some vestiges of your actual appearance. Creatures who already know you gain a +2 bonus on saving throws made to disbelieve this spell. Your duplicate has no actual substance, and you cannot use it to alter its surroundings or to attack or otherwise harm creatures it encounters. You can use the duplicate to speak, and interact verbally with creatures using the [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff), [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy), and [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) skills, and you gain a +2 competence bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks when using that skill through the duplicate.

You can see, hear, taste, and smell your duplicate's surroundings as if you are actually present using your [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) skill. While you also remain aware of your own immediate surroundings when controlling your duplicate, controlling it does take a toll on your senses. You take a –4 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks while you control your duplicate.

The duplicate moves under your mental command, and while you need not act out its movements, you must take a standard action to control your duplicate for 1 round (concentrating on the spell) or it winks out of existence. You can maintain control of your duplicate even if you have no line of sight or line of effect to it.

The duplicate immediately winks out of existence if it is hit by an attack or in the area of a damaging effect, or if it moves beyond the maximum range of the spell.

Village Veil

**School** illusion (figment) [mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 5, cleric 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, witch 5

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** long (400 ft. + 40 ft./level)

**Area** one 10-ft. cube per level

**Duration** 1 day/level

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief; **Spell Resistance** yes

You throw an illusion over an area to make creatures that view or interact with it believe it has suffered some great catastrophe or calamity that renders it utterly worthless for their needs. You must set a few general guidelines when casting the spell as to the nature of this disaster (fire, tornado, bandit raid, plague, etc.), after which the illusion fills in the remaining details to make it seem realistic. When casting the spell, you can grant creatures with particular, clearly identifiable physical traits (race, gender, age category, etc.) immunity to this spell. This allows all such eligible creatures to perceive the true nature of the affected area instead of its illusory appearance. Creatures without this immunity that fail their saving throws always perceive the affected area as having absolutely nothing of interest or worth to them. Unless they have reason for suspicion, they always move on without closely investigating the area. Creatures with sufficient reasons for suspicion who do choose to investigate the area gain another saving throw, this one with a +2 bonus, as they enter the village and directly interact with the illusion.

You can expand the area of this spell by casting it multiple times. Each time you do, you must effectively "attach" the spell to the existing area by using the same disaster and granting the same sorts of creatures immunity to its effects. If you fail to do this, the entire illusion, no matter how large, disappears.
