# Age

You can choose or randomly generate your character's age. If you choose it, it must be at least the minimum age for the character's race and class (see the Random Starting Ages tables). Alternatively, roll the dice indicated for your class on the appropriate table and add the result to the minimum age of adulthood for your race to determine your character's age.

With age, a character's physical ability scores decrease and his mental ability scores increase (see the Aging Effects tables). The effects of each aging step are cumulative. However, none of a character's ability scores can be reduced below 1 in this way.

When a character reaches venerable age, secretly roll his maximum age (on the appropriate Aging Effects table) and record the result, which the player does not know. A character who reaches his maximum age dies of old age sometime during the following year.

# Appendix 2: Height and Weight

To determine a character's height, roll the modifier dice indicated on the appropriate Random Height & Weight table and add the result, in inches, to the base height for your character's race and gender. To determine a character's weight, multiply the result of the modifier dice by the weight multiplier and add the result to the base weight for your character's race and gender.
