# Kitsune

Kitsune, or fox folk, are vulpine shapeshifters known for their love of both trickery and art. Kitsune possess two forms: that of an attractive human of slender build with salient eyes, and their true form of an anthropomorphic fox. Despite an irrepressible penchant for deception, kitsune prize loyalty and make true companions. They delight in the arts, particularly riddles and storytelling, and settle in ancestral clans, taking their wisdom from both the living and spirits.

Quick-witted and nimble, kitsune make excellent bards and rogues. It is not uncommon for one to pursue sorcery, while those few born with white fur and pale eyes usually become oracles.

# Kitsune Racial Traits

**Change Shape (Su)** : A kitsune can assume the appearance of a specific single human form of the same sex. The kitsune always takes this specific form when she uses this ability. A kitsune in human form cannot use her bite attack, but gains a +10 racial bonus on [Disguise](skills/disguise#_disguise) checks made to appear human. Changing shape is a standard action.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing kitsune racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Fast Shifter (Su)** : You were born with an innate talent for switching between your natural forms. Using your racial change shape ability is a move action instead of a standard action. This racial trait replaces kitsune magic.

**Gregarious (Ex)** : Even among your own kind, your gift for making friends stands out. Whenever you successfully use [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) to win over an individual, that creature takes a –2 penalty to resist any of your Charisma-based skill checks for the next 24 hours. This racial trait replaces agile.

# Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all kitsune who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Bard** : Add a +1/2 bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) checks to lie and a +1/2 bonus on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) checks to gather information.

When the nonproficiency penalty for a weapon becomes 0 because of this ability, the oracle is treated as having the appropriate Martial or [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) feat for that weapon.

**Rogue** : The rogue gains 1/6 of a new rogue talent.

**Sorcerer** : Add +1/4 to the DC of enchantment spells.

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to kitsune.

## Kitsune Trickster (Rogue)

The kitsune trickster combines her sharpened wit with minor arcane powers of charm and persuasion. She uses her talents to spin convincing lies, riddles, and stories. A trickster has the following class features.

**Kitsune's Guile (Ex)** : At 1st level, a trickster relies on her intellect as much as her personality. She adds her Intelligence modifier on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff), [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy), [Disguise](skills/disguise#_disguise), and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) checks. This ability replaces trapfinding.

**Kitsune's Charm (Sp)** : At 3rd level, a kitsune trickster can use _ [charm person](spells/charmPerson#_charm-person)_ once per day as a spell-like ability (caster level equal to her rogue level – 2). At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the kitsune trickster gains an additional daily use of this ability. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rogue Talents** : The following rogue talents complement the kitsune trickster archetype: major magic, minor magic (_Core Rulebook_); false friend, obfuscate story, steal the story (see below); charmer, coax information, honeyed words ; convincing lie.

**Advanced Talents** : The following advanced rogue talents complement the kitsune trickster archetype: skill mastery, slippery mind (_Core Rulebook_); master of disguise ; rumormonger.

# Rogue Talents

The following new rogue talents can be taken by any rogue who meets the prerequisites, but they are more common among kitsune.

_False Friend (Ex)_: A rogue with this talent gains a +4 bonus when making [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) checks to convince someone she has never met or who doesn't know her well that they are previously acquainted or know each other well.

_Obfuscate Story (Ex)_: While another individual attempts to give an account of an event, the rogue makes an opposed [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) check to deftly interject comments or statements over the course of the storytelling that cause the individual to muddle his ability to recall accurate or specific details. If the rogue succeeds, her target remains unaware that the rogue's interjections caused the confusion. However, if she fails, the target is allowed a [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) check (DC equal to the rogue's failed [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) check) to figure out that she made deliberate attempts to confuse the story.

_Steal the Story (Ex)_: After muddling another's account using obfuscate story, the rogue may make another opposed [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) check to alter the details further in order to discredit, insult, or humiliate the target. If the check succeeds, the target takes a penalty on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) and [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks against anyone who heard the altered story. This penalty is equal to the rogue's Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma bonus (whichever is highest), and lasts until the target is able to repair his reputation or discredit the rogue. The rogue must have the obfuscate story talent to select this talent.
