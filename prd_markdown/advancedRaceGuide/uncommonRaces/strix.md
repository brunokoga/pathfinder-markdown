# Strix

Human neighbors tell horrific tales of slaughter woven with frightened suspicion when speaking of strix. Strix, however, tell a tale of encroachment and a struggle for land and resources. For ages, humans invaded strix lands fighting bloody battles against the fierce, black-skinned creatures they thought to be winged devils. Over time, strix have developed a hatred for humankind and now fiercely protect their dwindling numbers.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing strix racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Dayguard** : Familiar with watching over its tribe during the day, the strix gains a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks and treats [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) as a class skill. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

**Wing-Clipped** : The flight of wing-clipped strix is weaker than normal, whether from deformity or injury. Their fly speed is 20 feet (poor) instead of the normal fly speed, and they must make a DC 30 [Fly](skills/fly.md#_fly) check to fly upward. Ostracized by their tribes and forced to deal with other races, these strix compensate for their weakness by gaining a +2 racial bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff), [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb), and [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) checks.

## Strix Equipment
