# Strix

Human neighbors tell horrific tales of slaughter woven with frightened suspicion when speaking of strix. Strix, however, tell a tale of encroachment and a struggle for land and resources. For ages, humans invaded strix lands fighting bloody battles against the fierce, black-skinned creatures they thought to be winged devils. Over time, strix have developed a hatred for humankind and now fiercely protect their dwindling numbers.

# Strix Racial Traits

**Normal Speed** : Strix have a base speed of 30 feet on land. They also have a fly speed of 60 feet (average).

**Low-Light Vision** : Strix can see twice as far as humans in conditions of dim light.

**Darkvision** : Strix can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Hatred** : Strix receive a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoid creatures with the human subtype because of their special training against these hated foes.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing strix racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Dayguard** : Familiar with watching over its tribe during the day, the strix gains a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks and treats [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) as a class skill. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

**Frightening** : The strix looks particularly menacing and use this to its advantage, gaining a +2 racial bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks. This racial trait replaces nocturnal.

**Nimble** : The strix receives a +1 racial bonus on Reflex saves. This replaces the suspicious racial trait.

**Tough** : The strix receives a +1 racial bonus on Fortitude saves. This racial trait replaces suspicious.

**Wing-Clipped** : The flight of wing-clipped strix is weaker than normal, whether from deformity or injury. Their fly speed is 20 feet (poor) instead of the normal fly speed, and they must make a DC 30 [Fly](skills/fly#_fly) check to fly upward. Ostracized by their tribes and forced to deal with other races, these strix compensate for their weakness by gaining a +2 racial bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff), [Climb](skills/climb#_climb), and [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) checks.

## Strix Equipment

Strix have access to the following equipment.

**Snag Net** : This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works like a typical net exotic weapon, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may make a trip combat maneuver check against that opponent; if you succeed, you may trip the opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to the opponent.
