# Vanaras

Vanaras are intelligent, monkeylike humanoids that live in deep, warm forests and lush jungles. A vanara's body is covered in a thin coat of soft fur, and individuals with chestnut, ivory, and even golden coats are common. Despite their fur, vanaras can grow lengthy hair on their head just as humans can, and both male and female vanaras take pains to wear elaborate hairstyles for important social functions. The hair on a vanara's head matches the color of its fur. All vanaras have long, prehensile tails and handlike feet capable of well-articulated movements. A vanara stands slightly shorter and weighs slightly less than a typical human.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing vanara racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Tree Stranger** : Some vanaras have spent their lives among humans in centers of learning instead of traditional treetop homes. These vanaras treat all [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) skills as class skills, but lose their climb speed racial trait.

**Whitecape** : The rare whitecape vanara clans have more in common with savanna-dwelling baboons than the jungle-dwelling monkeys that most vanaras resemble.

These vanaras usually have a thick mane of hair on the head and shoulders (called a "cape") and shorter tails. This racial trait replaces prehensile tail.

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to vanaras.

## Treetop Monk (Monk)

While many vanaras follow traditional monastic training and traditions, others learn to blend exotic combat and the mysterious forces of _ki_ with the natural world, allowing them to move through trees and overgrowth to deliver devastating attacks. A treetop monk has the following class features.

**Branch Runner (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a treetop monk adds half the base speed bonus from his fast movement ability to his racial climb speed. This ability replaces still mind.

**Wood Affinity (Su)** : At 5th level, a treetop monk may expend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a free action to treat a wooden object as if it were not broken for 1 minute (this includes a weapon with a wooden haft such as an axe or spear). At 8th level, as a free action, a treetop monk can expend 1 point from his _ki _pool to use the [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge) feat with any wooden or wood-hafted melee weapon. This ability replaces purity of body.

**_ [Freedom](spells/freedom.md#_freedom) of Movement_ (Su)** : At 12th level, a treetop may expend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a swift action to gain the effects of _ [freedom of movement](spells/freedomOfMovement.md#_freedom-of-movement)_ for 1 round. This ability replaces abundant step.

# New Racial Rules

The following options are available to vanaras. At the GM's discretion, other appropriate races may also make use of some of these.

## Vanara Equipment

Vanaras are known to use equipment crafted from the following material.

**Whipwood** : Vanara woodworkers craft this extremely flexible material in a time-consuming process. Whipwood is actually a composite of several bendable wooden fibers woven and fused together to form a flexible but sturdy unit. Only wooden weapons or weapons with wooden hafts (such as axes and spears) can be made out of whipwood. A creature wielding a whipwood weapon treats its CMD as +2 higher for the purpose of avoiding sunder attempts against that weapon. A whipwood weapon's hit points increase by +5. Whipwood loses its special qualities if under the effect of an _ [ironwood](spells/ironwood.md#_ironwood)_ spell.

| Type of Whipwood Item | Cost Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Wooden or wood-hafted weapon | +500 gp |

## Vanara Feats

Vanaras have access to the following feat.

### Tree Hanger (Combat)

You can use your tail to defend against trip attacks and to hang from nearby protrusions.

**Prerequisites** : [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) 1 rank, vanara.

**Benefit** : You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against all trip attacks. If your square has a branch or other sturdy large object that you could hang from, as a swift action you may make a DC 15 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check to jump upward and use your tail to hang from that object. While hanging, you can't be tripped, you ignore the effects of difficult terrain in your square, and you gain a +2 bonus to your CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attacks. If you leave that square (including if you are moved against your will), you lose your grip on the object and are no longer hanging. While hanging, you cannot use your tail for anything else.

## Vanara Magic Items

Vanaras have access to the following magic items.

Meridian Belt

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** belt; **Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

Description

This narrow cloth belt has a silver buckle in the shape of four rings. The belt allows a creature to wear a magic ring on each foot in addition to the ring on each hand, though only two rings function at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change which of his rings are active (both hands, both feet, left hand and right foot, and so on). For example, a creature could wear a _ [ring of protection](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-protection)_, _ [ring of energy resistance](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-energy-resistance)_, _ [ring of swimming](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-swimming)_, and _ [ring of counterspells](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-counterspells)_, switching between any two of them as a swift action each round as it desires.

The belt does not change the type of action required to activate a ring (for example, activating a _ [ring of invisibility](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-invisibility)_ is still a standard action), but allows the wearer to easily switch between the constant powers of several worn rings. While the belt is worn, wearing a ring on a foot counts toward the attunement process of certain rings (such as a _ [ring of sustenance](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-sustenance)_) even if the belt isn't used to make that ring active during that attunement period.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [polymorph](spells/polymorph.md#_polymorph)_; **Cost** 500 gp

## Vanara Spells

Vanaras have access to the following spell.

Prehensile Pilfer

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 3, bard 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

The target's tail moves and acts more quickly, almost with a mind of its own. When making a full-attack action, the target may use its tail to make a dirty trick or steal combat maneuver as a swift action. For the purpose of this attack, the target's tail is a natural weapon with a reach of 5 feet. This spell has no effect on creatures lacking a prehensile tail. If the target already has an extra attack from _ [haste](spells/haste.md#_haste)_ or a similar effect, this spell only allows the tail to make dirty trick and steal combat maneuvers, but does not grant an extra attack.
