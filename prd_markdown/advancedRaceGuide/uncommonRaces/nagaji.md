# Nagaji

The nagaji are a race of ophidian humanoids with scaled skin that mimics the dramatic appearance of true nagas. Like serpents, they have forked tongues and lidless eyes, giving them an unblinking gaze that most other races find unnerving. Their physical forms are otherwise humanlike, raising wary speculation about their origins. It is widely believed that true nagas created them as a servitor race, through crossbreeding, magic, or both, and indeed nagaji revere nagas as living gods. Nagaji often inspire awe and fear among other humanoids, as much for their mysterious ancestry as for their talent for both swords and sorcery.

# Nagaji Racial Traits

# Alternate Racial Traits

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to nagaji.

## Naga Aspirant (Druid)

The naga aspirant follows the ancient beliefs and engages in the rituals of a druidic sect dedicated to the transcendence of her nagaji form through absolute devotion to nagas and naga gods. Through acting as a herald to the naga deities, the aspirant is rewarded with the ability to unlock her ultimate spirit form and become a true naga. A naga aspirant has the following class features.

**Aspirant's Bond (Ex)** : A naga aspirant gains a spiritual connection to the serpentine deities worshiped by the nagas. At 1st level, and each time she gains a druid level, she may add one of the following spells to her druid spell list.

0—_ [acid splash](spells/acidSplash#_acid-splash)_, _ [bleed](spells/bleed#_bleed)_, _ [daze](spells/daze#_daze)_, _ [mage hand](spells/mageHand#_mage-hand)_, _ [open/close](spells/openClose#_open-close)_, _ [ray of frost](spells/rayOfFrost#_ray-of-frost)_; 1st—_ [charm person](spells/charmPerson#_charm-person)_, _ [divine favor](spells/divineFavor#_divine-favor)_, _ [expeditious retreat](spells/expeditiousRetreat#_expeditious-retreat)_, _ [mage armor](spells/mageArmor#_mage-armor)_, _ [magic missile](spells/magicMissile#_magic-missile), [ray of enfeeblement](spells/rayOfEnfeeblement#_ray-of-enfeeblement), [shield](spells/shield#_shield), [shield of faith](spells/shieldOfFaith#_shield-of-faith), [silent image](spells/silentImage#_silent-image), [true strike](spells/trueStrike#_true-strike)_; 2nd—_ [acid arrow](spells/acidArrow#_acid-arrow)_, _ [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_, _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_, _ [mirror image](spells/mirrorImage#_mirror-image)_, _ [scorching ray](spells/scorchingRay#_scorching-ray)_, _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility#_see-invisibility)_; 3rd—_ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic), [displacement](spells/displacement#_displacement), [fireball](spells/fireball#_fireball), [lightning bolt](spells/lightningBolt#_lightning-bolt), [suggestion](spells/suggestion#_suggestion)_; 4th—_ [divine power](spells/divinePower#_divine-power)_, _ [greater invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility-greater)_.

This ability replaces spontaneous casting.

**Aspirant's Enlightenment (Ex)** : At 4th level, a naga aspirant gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against the spell-like abilities, supernatural abilities, and poison of nagas. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Naga Shape (Su)** : At 6th level, the naga aspirant can use her wild shape ability (gained at 4th level, as normal) to assume the form of a true naga. This effect functions in a similar manner to a _ [shapechange](spells/shapechange#_shapechange)_ spell with the following exception. The druid's true naga form is unique, representing her personal evolution. When taking naga form, the nagaji's body transforms into that of a large serpent, though she keeps her own head. The naga aspirant loses her limbs and her size increases by one category, granting her a +4 size bonus to Strength and Constitution, a –2 penalty to Dexterity, and a +2 enhancement bonus to her natural armor bonus. She gains a +10 enhancement bonus to land speed and a bite attack that deals 1d6 points of damage. She can cast verbal spells in this form, but cannot cast spells with other components without metamagic or feats such as [Natural Spell](feats#_natural-spell). This otherwise works like and replaces wild shape.

**Augmented Form (Su)** _:_ At 9th level and every four levels thereafter, a naga aspirant can choose one of the following abilities to enhance her naga form. Once chosen, this augmentation cannot be changed and always applies to her naga form. The caster level for these abilities is equal to her druid level, and unless otherwise stated, the DC is equal to 10 + 1/2 the druid's class level + the druid's Charisma bonus. This ability replaces venom immunity, a thousand faces, and timeless body.

> _Charming Gaze (Sp)_: The druid gains a gaze attack that affects creatures within 30 feet as a _ [charm person](spells/charmPerson#_charm-person)_ spell.
> 
> _ [Darkvision](spells/darkvision#_darkvision) (Su)_: The druid gains darkvision with a range of 60 feet.
> 
> _Detect Thoughts (Su)_: The druid can use _ [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_ at will.
> 
> _Guarded Thoughts (Ex)_: The druid gains a +2 racial bonus on saves against charm effects and immunity to any form of mind reading (such as _ [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_).
> 
> _Poison Immunity (Ex)_: The druid gains immunity to all poisons. The druid's naga form must have at least one poison-based natural attack in order to select this ability.
> 
> _Poisonous Sting (Ex)_: The druid's stinger becomes venomous. The naga form must have a tail stinger to take this ability. Sting—injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the druid's class level + the druid's Constitution modifier; _frequency_ 1 round; _effect_ sleep for 2d4 minutes; _cure_ 1 save.
> 
> _Spit Venom (Ex)_: The naga form can spit her venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Any opponent hit by this attack must make a successful save (see above) to avoid the effect. The naga form must have a venomous bite to take this ability.
> 
> _Sting (Ex)_: The naga form grows a stinger on the end of her tail, granting her a sting natural attack that deals 1d6 points of piercing damage.
> 
> _ [Swim](skills/swim#_swim) (Ex)_: The naga form gains a swim speed equal to her base speed.
> 
> _Tough Scales (Ex)_: The druid's enhancement bonus to her natural armor increases by +2. The druid may select this ability more than once. Its effects stack.
> 
> _Venomous Bite (Ex)_: The naga form's bite attack becomes poisonous. Bite—injury; _save_ Fortitude DC 10 + 1/2 the druid's class level + the druid's Constitution modifier; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ 1 Constitution damage, _cure_ 1 save.

**True Naga (Su)** : At 20th level, a naga aspirant metamorphoses into a unique naga. Her wild shape form becomes her natural form, though she can transform into her original nagaji shape at will. Her creature type permanently changes to aberration. This ability replaces wildshape (at will).
