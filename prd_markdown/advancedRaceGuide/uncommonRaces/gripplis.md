# Gripplis

Gripplis stand just over 2 feet tall and have mottled green-and-brown skin. Most gripplis are primitive hunter gatherers, living on large insects and fish found near their treetop homes, and are unconcerned about events outside their swamps. The rare grippli who leaves the safety of the swamp tends to be a ranger or alchemist seeking to trade for metals and gems.

# Grippli Racial Traits

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Wisdom, –2 Strength** : Gripplis are nimble and alert, but spindly.

**Small** : Gripplis are Small creatures and gain a +1 size bonus to their AC, a +1 size bonus on attack rolls, a –1 penalty to their CMB and CMD, and a +4 size bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks.

**Darkvision** : Gripplis can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Camouflage** : Gripplis receive a +4 racial bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks in marshes and forested areas.

**Swamp Stride (Ex)** : A grippli can move through difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects a grippli normally.

**Weapon Familiarity** : Gripplis are proficient with nets.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing grippli racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Glider** : Gripplis' aerodynamic bodies and thick webbing between the toes enable a falling grippli to treat the distance fallen as half the actual distance. The grippli can steer himself while falling, moving horizontally up to a number of feet equal to half the vertical distance fallen. The grippli cannot use this trait if it is wearing heavy armor, is carrying a heavy load, or is unable to react to the fall (such as being helpless). This racial trait replaces swamp stride.

**Jumper** : Gripplis with this trait are always considered to have a running start when making [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks to jump. This racial trait replaces camouflage.

**Princely** : The grippli gains proficiency with rapiers and a +2 racial bonus on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) and [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) checks. This racial trait replaces swamp stride and weapon familiarity.

**Toxic Skin (Ex)** : Once per day as a swift action, a grippli can create a poison that can be applied to a weapon or delivered as a touch attack. Alternatively, the grippli can smear the poison on its own body as a standard action, affecting the first creature to hit it with an unarmed strike or natural weapon. The poison loses its potency after 1 hour. The grippli is immune to its own poison. This racial trait replaces swamp stride and camouflage.

> _Grippli Poison_: Skin or weapon—contact or injury; save Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the grippli's Hit Dice plus its Constitution modifier; frequency 1/round for 6 rounds; effect 1d2 Dexterity damage; cure 1 save.
# Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all gripplis who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Alchemist** : Add +1/4 to the number of toxic skin uses per day.

**Druid** : Add a +1/2 bonus on concentration checks. This bonus doubles in a forest or swamp terrain.

**Gunslinger** : Add a +1/4 bonus on attack rolls when making a utility shot or a dead shot.

**Rogue** : Add a +1/2 bonus on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks while in a forest or swamp.

**Ranger** : Add a +1 racial bonus on [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) skill checks. When this bonus reaches +8, the ranger gains a swim speed of 15 feet (this does not grant the ranger another +8 racial bonus on [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) checks).

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to gripplis.

## Bogborn Alchemist (Alchemist)

Some grippli alchemists are particularly attuned to the swamps and the dangerous creatures that inhabit them; these serve as their laboratories and research subjects, respectively. These bogborn alchemists have the following class features.

**Class Skills** : A bogborn alchemist adds [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) to his list of class skills.

**Amphibious Mutagen (Ex)** : At 1st level, when a bogborn alchemist uses a mutagen, he may choose to have his mutagen form enhanced for aquatic movement. This gives him the amphibious special quality, his feet elongate, and the webbing between his fingers and toes expands, granting a swim speed of 15 feet. This replaces throw anything.

**Discovery Options** : A bogborn alchemist can select the toxic skin grippli racial trait in place of an alchemical discovery.

**Discoveries** : The following discoveries complement the bogborn alchemist archetype: chameleon; concentrate poison, sticky poison ; nauseating flesh, poison conversion; bottled ooze, tanglefoot bomb, tentacle .

# Grippli Discoveries

The following new discoveries can be taken by any alchemist who meets the prerequisites, but are more common among gripplis.

**Chameleon (Su)** : An alchemist with this discovery can shift the colors of his skin and equipment to blend in with the surrounding terrain. He gains a +4 enhancement bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks. At 10th level, the bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks increases to +8.

**Deadly Excretions (Ex)** : When using his toxic skin ability, the alchemist can choose to excrete a Constitution poison instead of a Dexterity poison. This poison works the same as the normal grippli toxic skin poison except that a failed save deals 1 point of Constitution damage. The alchemist must be at least 8th level and must have the toxic skin racial trait before selecting this discovery.

> _Underwater Demolition (Ex)_: The alchemist gains the ability to throw bombs underwater (normally, thrown weapons cannot be used underwater), including throwing from the air into the water. If the bomb travels through water, the range increment is reduced to 5 feet.
# New Racial Rules

**Black Marsh Spider Venom** : This potent spider venom causes victims to become disoriented and lose muscle control until eventually they collapse.

## Grippli Feats

Gripplis have access to the following feat.

### Agile Tongue

Your long pink tongue is capable of manipulating small items and even stealing objects.

**Prerequisite** : Grippli.

## Grippli Magic Items

Gripplis have access to the following magic item.

Bubble Vault

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 1,500 gp; **Weight** —

Description

This tiny pearl swells to form a 1-foot-diameter soap-like bubble when placed in water. Up to 5 cubic feet of goods can be placed inside the _bubble vault_. On command, the bubble sinks to the bottom of the water, automatically burying itself 1 foot deep in the bottom ground if there is mud or other loose material present. If the command word is spoken three times within 30 feet of the bubble, it rises to the surface of the water, at which time it can be opened and the items within it retrieved. Once opened, the bubble reverts to its pearl form for 24 hours. The bubble is watertight but does not otherwise magically protect or preserve its contents. If forced open, it has hardness 1 and 5 hit points.
