# Svirfneblin

In the dark below earth, svirfneblin protect their enclaves, keeping their small communities safe from the terrors of the lightless depths. Serious creatures with slate-gray skin, these gnomes vary greatly from their surface cousins by choosing to live in the shadowy depths and protect the world above from the foul creatures sharing their chambers, vaults, and tunnels.

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to svirfneblin.

## Deep Bomber (Alchemist)

Consumed with keeping hidden from the horrors below the surface, svirfneblin use their racial proclivity for alchemy and their inherent talent for obfuscation to strike their enemies from the darkness and retreat unseen. A deep bomber has the following class features.

**Silent Bomb** : At 2nd level, when the deep bomber creates a bomb, he can choose to have it explode without making any noise, although those damaged by it may cry out. This ability replaces poison use.

**Targeting Bomb\*** : At 3rd level, when the deep bomber creates a bomb, he can choose to have its detonation include a _ [faerie fire](spells/faerieFire.md#_faerie-fire)_ effect that applies to all creatures within the splash radius (including the target, if any). This ability replaces swift alchemy (the deep bomber gains swift alchemy at 18th level and never gains instant alchemy).

**Stonekin** : At 6th level, the deep bomber automatically learns _ [tree shape](spells/treeShape.md#_tree-shape)_ as a 2nd-level extract, except instead of a tree, he takes the form of a stalagmite that is the same size as his current size. At 7th level, he automatically learns _ [meld into stone](spells/meldIntoStone.md#_meld-into-stone)_ as a 3rd-level extract. This ability replaces swift poisoning.

**Discoveries** : The following discoveries complement the deep bomber archetype: delayed bomb, dispelling bomb, fast bombs, infusion, madness bomb, poison bomb.

# Svirfneblin Discoveries

The following new discoveries can be taken by any alchemist who meets the prerequisites, but are more common among svirfneblin.

_ [Darkness](spells/darkness.md#_darkness) Bomb\*_: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it suppress light sources on the target. This extinguishes nonmagical light sources carried by the target and dispels magical light sources for 1 round/level as _ [deeper darkness](spells/deeperDarkness.md#_deeper-darkness)_.

_Glassfoot Bomb\*_: When the alchemist creates a bomb, he can choose to have it cover the ground in volatile jagged crystals in addition to its normal effects. These crystals act like caltrops, evaporating into a smelly but harmless gas in 2d6 rounds.

# New Racial Rules

The following options are available to svirfneblin. At the GM's discretion, other appropriate races may also make use of some of these.

## Svirfneblin Equipment

Svirfneblin have access to the following equipment.

**Jolting Dart** : This alchemically grown crystal dart builds up an electrical charge when thrown. A creature struck by the dart takes normal piercing damage and 1d6 points of electricity damage. Anyone proficient in darts can use a jolting dart. Once thrown, the dart is destroyed.

[Svirfneblin Weapon]
| Martial Weapons | Cost | Dmg (S) | Dmg (M) | Critical | Range | Weight | Type | Special |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Svirfneblin Feats

Svirfneblin have access to the following feat.

### Stoic Pose

You can hold yourself as still as a statue, evading detection.

**Prerequisite** : Svirfneblin.

**Benefit** : By spending 5 rounds finding a suitable location, you can hold yourself so still that you appear to be a Small object such as a pile of rocks. This allows you to make a [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) check without cover or concealment, as long as you do not move or take any other actions.

## Svirfneblin Spells

Svirfneblin have access to the following spells.

Earth Glide

**School** transmutation [[earth](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_earth-subtype)]; **Level** alchemist 4, druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

The target can pass through stone, dirt, or almost any other sort of earth except metal as easily as a fish swims through water, traveling at a speed of 5 feet. If protected against fire damage, it can move through lava. This movement leaves behind no tunnel or hole, nor does it create any ripple or other sign of its presence. It requires as much concentration as walking, so the subject can attack or cast spells normally, but cannot charge or run. Casting _ [move earth](spells/moveEarth.md#_move-earth)_ on an area containing the target flings the target back 30 feet, stunning it for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates). This spell does not give the target the ability to breathe underground, so when passing through solid material, the creature must hold its breath.
