# Duergar

Duergar dwell in subterranean caverns far from the touch of light. They detest all races living beneath the sun, but that hatred pales beside their loathing of their surface-dwarf cousins. Dwarves and duergar once were one race, but the dwarves left the deeps for their mountain strongholds. Duergar still consider themselves the only true dwarves, and the rightful heirs of all beneath the world's surface. In appearance, duergar resemble gray-skinned dwarves, bearded but bald, with cold, lightless eyes. They favor taking captives in battle over wanton slaughter, save for surface dwarves, who are slain without hesitation. Duergar view life as ceaseless toil ended only by death. Though few can be described as anything other than vile and cruel, duergar still value honor and rarely break their word.

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetype is available to duergar.

## Gray Disciple (Monk)

The gray disciple contemplates the inner voice of duergar magic and the silent eternity of stone, mastering these dual mysteries and combining them to deadly effect.

**Fade from Sight (Sp)** : At 4th level, as a swift action, the gray disciple can become invisible (as the _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_ spell) for 1 round by spending 1 _ki_ point. To use this ability, the gray disciple must already have _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_ as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces slow fall and still mind.

**Gray Heart (Sp)** : At 6th level, as a swift action, the gray disciple can enlarge himself (as the _ [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson#_enlarge-person)_ spell) for 1 minute by spending 1 _ki_ point. To use this ability, the gray disciple must already have _ [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson#_enlarge-person)_ available as a spell-like ability. This ability replaces high jump and the bonus feat gained at 6th level.

**Born in Darkness (Sp)** : At 7th level, as a standard action, the gray disciple can radiate _ [darkness](spells/darkness#_darkness)_ (as the spell, except originating from the disciple's person) for 1 round per level by spending 1 _ki_ point. This ability replaces wholeness of body.

**Earth Glide (Su)** : At 12th level, as a swift action, the gray disciple can spend a _ki_ point to walk through solid stone for 1 round. This functions as the earth glide universal monster ability. The gray disciple may continue earth gliding as long as he spends 1 _ki_ point every round as a swift action. If he ceases earth gliding within a solid object, he is violently ejected and takes 5d6 points of damage. The gray disciple is not harmed by damage caused to material he is earth gliding through, but a _ [stone to flesh](spells/stoneToFlesh#_stone-to-flesh)_ spell cast upon it causes violent ejection as described above. This ability replaces abundant step.

**Entomb (Su):** At 15th level, a gray disciple can phase a foe into solid rock, killing it instantly. To use this ability, he expends 1 ki point as part of a bull rush or reposition combat maneuver against a creature adjacent to unworked earth or stone. If the attempt succeeds, the gray disciple pushes his foe inside the rock using his earth glide ability. If the creature succeeds at a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the gray disciple's monk level + the gray disciple's Wisdom modifier), it is ejected in the nearest open space and takes 5d6 points of damage. If it fails, it dies instantly as its body merges with the surrounding stone. Entomb is usable once per day, but a failed bull rush or reposition attempt does not count as a use of the ability. Entomb has no effect on creatures that can earth glide, are incorporeal, or can otherwise can survive merging with a solid object. This ability replaces quivering palm.

**Earthen Thrall (Sp)** : At 17th level, a gray disciple can attempt to control a creature with the earth subtype once per day. This ability is treated as _ [dominate monster](spells/dominateMonster#_dominate-monster)_ (DC 10 + 1/2 the gray disciple's monk level + the gray disciple's Wisdom modifier), but is only effective against creatures with the earth subtype, and the gray disciple can keep only a single creature enthralled. If he attempts to control a second creature with this ability, the first creature is automatically released from domination whether or not the second attempt succeeds. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon and empty body.
