The creature can hurl the rock up to five rage increments. Damage from a thrown rock is 2d6 plus 1-1/2 times the throwing creature's Strength bonus.

## Senses Racial Traits

All races start with normal vision. The following traits augment their vision or otherwise enhance their senses.

### Standard Traits

**Carrion Sense (1 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race have a natural ability to sniff out carrion. This functions like the scent ability, but only for corpses and badly wounded creatures (creatures with 25% or fewer hit points).

**Darkvision 60 Feet (2 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Darkvision 120 Feet (3 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race can see in the dark up to 120 feet.

**Deepsight (2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Amphibious racial trait; _Benefit_: Members of this race are specially adapted to the lightless depths of the oceans, but not to air-filled environments. They can see in the dark up to 120 feet while underwater, but do not gain this benefit out of water.

**Low-Light Vision (1 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race can see twice as far as a race with normal vision in conditions of dim light.

**Minesight (2 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race have darkvision 90 feet; however, they are automatically dazzled in bright light and take a –2 penalty on saving throws against effects with the light descriptor.

**Water Sense (1 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Outsider (native) with ties to the Plane of Water or amphibious racial trait; _Benefit_: Members of this race can sense vibrations in water, granting them blindsense 30 feet against creatures that are touching the same body of water.

### Advanced Traits

**Scent (4 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race gain the scent ability .

**See in Darkness (4 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race can see perfectly in darkness of any kind, including that created by spells such as _ [deeper darkness](spells/deeperDarkness#_deeper-darkness)_.

### Monstrous Traits

**All-Around Vision (4 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race have some way of seeing all around them, granting them a +4 racial bonus on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks and making them immune to flanking.

Blindsense 30 Feet (4 RP): Prerequisites: None; Benefit: Using nonvisual senses such as acute smell or hearing, members of this race notice things they cannot see. Members of this race usually do not need to make [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks to pinpoint the location of a creature within 30 feet, provided they have line of effect to that creature. A creature that members of this race cannot see still has total concealment against individuals with blindsense, and members of this race still have the normal miss chance when attacking creatures that have concealment. Visibility still affects the movement of members of this race. Members of this race are still denied their Dexterity bonus to AC against attacks from creatures they cannot see.  

## Weakness Racial Traits

The following racial traits apply weaknesses to members of the race. All weakness racial traits cost negative RP, which means they subtract from a race's total RP spent for the purposes of meeting the race's power level restrictions.

### Standard Traits

**Light Blindness (–2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Darkvision or see in darkness trait; _Weakness_: Abrupt exposure to bright light blinds members of this race for 1 round; on subsequent rounds, they are dazzled as long as they remain in the affected area.

**Light Sensitivity (–1 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Darkvision; _Weakness_: Members of this race are dazzled as long as they remain in an area of bright light.

**Negative Energy Affinity (–1 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Weakness_: A member of this race is alive, but reacts to positive and negative energy as if it were undead—positive energy harms it, while negative energy heals it.

**Resurrection Vulnerability (–1 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Half-undead subtype or undead type; _Weakness_: A _ [raise dead](spells/raiseDead#_raise-dead)_ spell cast on a member of this race can destroy it (Will negates). Using the spell in this way does not require a material component.

**Vulnerable to Sunlight (–2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Native to the Darklands or the Plane of Shadow; _Weakness_: Members of this race take 1 point of Constitution damage after every hour they are exposed to sunlight.

### Advanced Traits

**Elemental Vulnerability (–2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Outsider (native) with ties to an elemental plane; _Weakness_: Pick one of the following energy types: acid, cold, electricity, or fire. Members of this race have vulnerability to the chosen energy type. They cannot posses any racial trait that grants them resistance or immunity to this energy type. _Special_: This trait can be taken multiple times. Each time it is taken, choose a different energy type. If a race has vulnerability to fire and immunity to cold, it gains the cold subtype. If a race has vulnerability to cold and immunity to fire, it gains the fire subtype.

**Sunlight Powerlessness (–2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Half-undead subtype or undead type; _Weakness_: Members of this race are powerless in natural sunlight (this does not include light created by effects such as a _ [daylight](spells/daylight#_daylight)_ spell). A member of this race caught in natural sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.

## Other Racial Traits

This category covers various traits that other categories do not, which can augment your race in a number of different ways.

### Standard Traits

**Amphibious (2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: [Swim](skills/swim#_swim) racial trait; _Benefit_: Members of this race are amphibious and can breathe both air and water.

**Heroic (4 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: In campaigns that use the optional hero point system , each time a member of this race gains a level, it gains 2 hero points instead of 1. If it takes the Blood of Heroes feat, it gains 3 hero points each level instead of 2.

**Hold Breath (1 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race can hold their breath for a number of rounds equal to four times their Constitution score before risking drowning or suffocating.

**Light and Dark (1 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race gain the following supernatural ability: Once per day as an immediate action, a member of this race can treat positive and negative energies as if it were an undead creature, taking damage from positive energy and healing damage from negative energy. This ability lasts for 1 minute once activated.

**Multitalented (2 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race choose two favored classes at 1st level and gain +1 hit points or +1 skill rank whenever they take a level in either of those classes.

**Prehensile Tail (2 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race have a long, flexible tail that can be used to carry objects. They cannot wield weapons with their tails, but they can retrieve small, stowed objects carried on their persons as a swift action.

**Rodent Empathy (1 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Ratfolk subtype; _Benefit_: Members of this race gain a +4 bonus on [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) checks made to influence rodents.

**Treespeech (2 RP)** : _Prerequisite_: Plant type; _Benefit_: Members of this race have the ability to converse with plants as if subject to a continual _ [speak with plants](spells/speakWithPlants#_speak-with-plants)_ spell.

### Advanced Traits

**Grabbing Appendages (6 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: Any type except humanoid, Large size; _Benefit_: Members of this race have a small group of appendages that are useful for little more than to aid in grappling. Members of this race gain Improved Grapple as a bonus feat, and can maintain a grapple and still make attacks with their main appendages.

### Monstrous Traits

**Multi-Armed (4 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: None; _Benefit_: Members of this race possess three arms. A member of this race can wield multiple weapons, but only one hand is its primary hand, and all others are off hands. It can also use its hands for other purposes that require free hands. _Special_: This trait can be taken up to twice. When it is taken a second time, the race gains a fourth arm.

**Quadruped (2 RP)** : _Prerequisites_: Any type except humanoid, Large size, normal speed; _Benefit_: Members of this race possess four legs and two arms, granting them a +4 racial bonus to CMD against trip attempts and a +10 foot bonus to their base speed. In addition, members of this race use weapons and armor as if they were Medium (instead of Large). _Special_: The number of legs can be increased by 2 for each additional 1 RP spent. Each such increase grants an additional +4 racial bonus to CMD against trip attempts, but no other bonus.

## Quadrupeds and Magic Item Slots

Creating a race with more than two legs adversely affects that race's ability to use standard feet slot magic items. The best way to deal with this is to create variant magic item versions of the various boots, shoes, and slippers that can be worn by this race. Allow members of these races to find _ankle bracelets of [speed](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-speed)_ or _horseshoes of [spider climb](spells/spiderClimb#_spider-climb)_ that act just like their traditional magic item counterparts, but fit the new race's form.
