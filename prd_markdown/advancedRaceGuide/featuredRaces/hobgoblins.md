# Hobgoblins

Fierce and militaristic, hobgoblins survive by conquest. The raw materials to fuel their war machines come from raids, their armaments and buildings from the toil of slaves worked to death. Naturally ambitious and envious, hobgoblins seek to better themselves at the expense of others of their kind, yet in battle they put aside petty differences and fight with discipline rivaling that of the finest soldiers. Hobgoblins have little love or trust for one another, and even less for outsiders. Life for these brutes consists of duty to those of higher station, domination of those below, and the rare opportunities to seize personal glory and elevate their status.

**Physical Description** : Burly and muscled, hobgoblins stand a few inches shorter than the average human, and their long arms, thick torsos, and relatively short legs give them an almost apelike stature. Hobgoblins' skin is a sickly gray-green that darkens to mossy green after long exposure to the sun. Their eyes burn fiery orange or red, and their broad faces and sharply pointed ears give their features a somewhat feline cast. Hobgoblins lack facial hair, and even hobgoblin women are bald. Except for their size, hobgoblins bear a strong physical resemblance to their goblin cousins.

**Society** : Hobgoblins live in militaristic tyrannies, each community under the absolute rule of a hobgoblin general. Every hobgoblin in a settlement receives military training, with those who excel serving in the army and the rest left to serve more menial roles. Those deemed unfit for military service have little social status, barely rating above favored slaves. Despite this, hobgoblin society is egalitarian after a fashion. Gender and birth offer no barrier to advancement, which is determined almost solely by each individual's personal merit. Hobgoblins eschew strong attachments, even to their young. Matings are matters of convenience, and are almost always limited to hobgoblins of equal rank. Any resulting baby is taken from its mother and forcibly weaned after 3 weeks of age. Young mature quickly—most take no more than 6 months to learn to talk and care for themselves. Hobgoblins' childhoods last a scant 14 years, a mirthless span filled with brutal training in the art of war.

**Relations** : Hobgoblins view other races as nothing more than tools—implements to be enslaved, cowed, and put to work. Without slaves, hobgoblin society would collapse, so reliant is it on stolen labor. An injured, sickly, or defiant slave is like a broken tool, useless waste to be tossed out with the day's garbage. Not surprisingly, hobgoblin communities count no other races as their friends, and few as allies. Elves and dwarves earn special enmity, and are devilishly hard to break into proper slavery as both races hold blood feuds against goblinkind. Halflings and half-orcs make especially prized slaves—the former for their agile skills and the ease of breaking them to the collar, and the latter for their talent at thriving under the harshest of conditions. Hobgoblins have little love for the rest of goblinkind, though they typically treat goblinoid slaves better than they do other races.

**Alignment and Religion** : Hobgoblin life is nothing if not ordered and hierarchical, and hobgoblins lean strongly toward the lawful alignments. While not innately evil, the callous and brutal training that fills the too-short childhood of hobgoblins leaves most embittered and full of hate. Hobgoblins of good alignment number the fewest, and almost exclusively consist of individuals raised in other cultures. More numerous but still rare are hobgoblins of chaotic bent, most often exiles cast out by the despots of their homelands. Religion, like most non-militaristic pursuits, matters little to the majority of hobgoblins. Most pay lip-service to one or more gods and occasionally make offerings to curry favor or turn aside ill fortune. Those hobgoblins who feel a stronger religious calling venerate fearsome, tyrannical gods and devils.

**Adventurers** : Hobgoblin adventurers tend to be iconoclasts, loners who chafe under the strict hierarchy of military life. Others have fled or been exiled in disgrace for showing weakness or cowardice. Some harbor dreams of one day returning to the hobgoblin flock flush with wealth and tales of great deeds. A few serve farsighted hobgoblin generals, who send the most promising youths out into the world that they might someday return as mighty heroes for the hobgoblin cause. Hobgoblins lean toward martial classes, particularly cavaliers, fighters, monks, and rogues. The arcane arts are distrusted in hobgoblin society and consequently their practitioners are rare, save for alchemists, who gain grudging praise and admiration for their pyrotechnic talents.

**Male Names** : Aronok, Bankanir, Dorduken, Fentanas, Grur, Hagors, Kalmant, Malgroar, Slatark, Talogan.

**Female Names** : Arinet, Eloqi, Eskani, Horinnia, Korumun, Moranassa, Moritla, Nimanisi, Noranillim, Vortiga.

# Alternate Racial Traits

The following racial traits may be selected instead of existing hobgoblin racial traits. Consult your GM before selecting any of these new options.

**Bandy-Legged** : Bandy-legged hobgoblins have an even more exaggerated stature than other hobgoblins, with bowed legs and massive shoulders. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) and [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) checks, and a +2 racial bonus to their CMD against bull rush or trip attempts while on solid ground. The base speed of bandy-legged hobgoblins is reduced to 20 feet.

**Battle-Hardened** : Incessant drills make defense second nature to some hobgoblins. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +1 bonus to CMD. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Engineer** : Hobgoblin engineers tinker endlessly with fire, explosives, and the engines of war. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (alchemy) and [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (engineering) checks. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Fearsome** : Some hobgoblins scorn caution and subtlety for swagger and bluster. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +4 racial bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Magehunter** : Hobgoblins hate and fear arcane casters. A magehunter gains a +2 racial bonus on [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) checks made to identify a spell being cast and a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against arcane spellcasters. He only gains this bonus against creatures that use spells, and not against those that only use spell-like abilities. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Pit Boss** : Slave blood fuels the hobgoblin war machine. Pit bosses extract the last breath of labor from their charges with a liberal touch of the lash. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain proficiency with whips and a +1 racial bonus on combat maneuver checks made to disarm or trip with a whip. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Scarred** : A hobgoblin can scar himself with both blade and fire to toughen his hide into a mass of horny scars. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +1 natural armor bonus to Armor Class. However, the repeated exposure to fire permanently damages their eyes. This racial trait replaces the darkvision racial trait.

**Slave Hunter** : Hobgoblin slavers excel at tracking down runaway slaves and surviving in filthy conditions. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) checks and a +2 racial bonus on Fortitude saves against disease. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

**Unfit** : Hobgoblins who failed to secure a position in the military hold the lowest status in hobgoblin society, and quickly learn the value of currying favor with their betters. Hobgoblins with this racial trait gain proficiency in a single martial weapon and +1 racial bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) and [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) checks. This racial trait replaces sneaky.

# Favored Class Options

The following options are available to all hobgoblins who have the listed favored class, and unless otherwise stated, the bonus applies each time you select the favored class reward.

**Alchemist** : Add +1/2 to the number of bombs per day the alchemist can create.

**Cavalier** : Add a +1/2 bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks and [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) checks.

**Cleric** : Add +1/2 to negative energy spell damage, including inflict spells.

**Fighter** : Add a +1/2 circumstance bonus on critical hit confirmation rolls with a weapon of the fighter's choice (maximum bonus +4). This bonus does not stack with [Critical Focus](feats#_critical-focus).

**Gunslinger** : Add +1/4 to the gunslinger's grit points.

**Inquisitor** : Add a +1 bonus on concentration checks made to cast inquisitor spells.

**Monk** : Add a +1/4 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple or trip.

**Ranger** : Add +1/4 to a single existing favored enemy bonus (maximum bonus +1 per favored enemy).

**Rogue** : Reduce the penalty for not being proficient with one weapon by 1. When the nonproficiency penalty for a weapon becomes 0 because of this ability, the rogue is treated as having the appropriate Martial or [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) feat for that weapon.

# Racial Archetypes

The following racial archetypes are available to hobgoblins.

## Fell Rider (Cavalier)

The fell rider rides a bestial steed, a mount mastered by him alone. He tramples his enemies down, leaving twisted bodies in his wake, and fear rides with him.

**Brute Steed (Ex)** : A fell rider's mount is unusually large and fierce. It gains a +2 bonus to Strength, but takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity. This otherwise works like the cavalier's mount ability and alters that ability.

**Rampage (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a fell rider gains Trample as a bonus feat. The fell rider receives a +2 bonus on overrun attempts made while mounted. In addition, his mount gains a +2 bonus on damage rolls when making hoof attacks or using the trample monster ability, even when not overrunning. This ability replaces cavalier's charge.

**Dread Rider (Ex)** : At 4th level, a fell rider gains a bonus equal to 1/2 his level on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks made while mounted. Once per round as a free action, he can make an [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) check to demoralize a foe he has trampled or charged while mounted. This ability replaces expert trainer.

**Fell Presence (Ex)** : At 5th level, a fell rider inspires dread while mounted. As long as the fell rider is mounted, all enemies within 60 feet receive a –2 penalty on savings throws against fear. At 10th level and every 5 levels thereafter, this penalty increases by –1. This ability replaces banner.

**Deadly Rampage (Ex):** At 11th level, a mounted fell rider no longer provokes attacks of opportunity when he attempts to overrun a creature. He can make a single melee attack against the creature as a free action if the overrun attempt succeeds. This ability replaces mighty charge.

**Terror (Ex):** At 14th level, a fell rider can rear up his mount as a standard action, spreading terror among his enemies. Enemies within 60 feet who can see the fell rider must succeed at a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 the fell rider's level + the fell rider's Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round per level the fell rider possesses. Creatures with half or fewer Hit Dice than the fell rider become frightened instead. An opponent that succeeds at the saving throw is immune to that fell rider's terror ability for 24 hours. This ability is a mind-affecting fear effect, and replaces greater banner.

**Unstoppable Rampage (Ex):** At 20th level, a mounted fell rider can overrun up to four creatures as part of a single overrun combat maneuver. Each attempt made against a creature after the first receives a cumulative –5 penalty (for example, the fourth overrun attempt would be at a –15 penalty). If any overrun attempt fails, the fell rider cannot make further overrun attempts that round. Attacks made by the fell rider or his mount as part of the overrun, such as those provided by the Trample feat or the deadly rampage ability, receive a +4 bonus to hit, and any critical threats from these attacks automatically confirm. This ability replaces supreme charge.

## Ironskin Monk (Monk)

Through discipline and training, an ironskin monk hardens his body to withstand punishing blows. Though slow on his feet, his calloused hands and feet can shatter stone and stagger foes.

**Iron Skin (Ex)** : At 1st level, an ironskin monk gains a +1 bonus to his natural armor. This bonus stacks with any existing natural armor the ironskin monk already has. At 4th level, and every 4 levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +1. This ability replaces the monk's AC bonus ability and the ability to add his Wisdom bonus to his AC.

**Bonus Feat** : At 1st level, an ironskin monk adds [Power Attack](feats#_power-attack) to his list of bonus feats. At 6th level, he adds Improved Sunder to the list. At 10th level, he adds Greater Sunder to the list. These bonus feat choices replace [Dodge](feats#_dodge), Mobility, and Spring Attack on his bonus feat list.

**Resilience (Ex)** : At 2nd level, an ironskin monk can shake off the physical effects of certain attacks. If he makes a Fortitude saving throw against an attack that has a reduced effect on a successful save, he instead avoids the effect entirely. This ability can be used only if the monk is wearing light armor or no armor. A helpless monk does not gain the benefits of resilience. This ability replaces evasion.

**_Ki_ Pool (Su)** : At 4th level, an ironskin monk can spend 1 point from his _ki_ pool to gain a damage bonus equal to 1/2 his level against objects and constructs for 1 round. This replaces the ability to increase speed with _ki_.

**Staggering Blow (Ex)** : At 5th level, an ironskin monk attacking with an unarmed strike can spend 1 point from his _ki_ pool as a free action after a successful critical hit to stagger the creature struck for 1 round (Fort DC 10 + 1/2 the ironskin monk's level + the ironskin monk's Wisdom modifier negates). This ability replaces high jump.

**Tough as Nails (Ex)** : At 6th level, an ironskin monk gains DR 1/—. Subtract 1 point from the damage the ironskin monk takes each time he is dealt damage from a weapon or a natural attack. This damage reduction increases by 1 point at 9th level and every 3 levels thereafter. Damage reduction can reduce damage to 0 but not below 0. This ability replaces fast movement and slow fall.

**Evasion (Ex)** : At 9th level, an ironskin monk gains evasion. This ability replaces improved evasion.

**Surefooted (Ex)** : At 17th level, an ironskin monk's speed is not reduced by difficult terrain. This ability replaces tongue of the sun and moon.

**Unbreakable (Ex)** : At 20th level, an ironskin monk sets aside many of the frailties of mortal flesh. He becomes immune to death effects and stunning. He is not subject to ability damage or ability drain, and has a 75% chance of ignoring the extra damage dealt by critical hits and sneak attacks. This ability replaces perfect self.

# New Racial Rules

The following options are available to hobgoblins. At the GM's discretion, other appropriate races may make use of some of these new rules.

## Hobgoblin Equipment

Hobgoblins have access to the following equipment.

**Brewed Reek** : Animal musk, spoiled meat, pungent plants, and any other foul-smelling substances on hand go into a batch of brewed reek. When boiled, this mixture becomes a thick alchemical slime that adheres to anything it touches. You can hurl brewed reek as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. A creature struck with a direct hit must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 2d6 rounds. If the target fails its save, it must make a second Fortitude save or be nauseated for 1 round. Creatures in the splash area must make a Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. A creature that drinks brewed reek does not get a saving throw and is sickened for 2d6 rounds and nauseated for 1 round.

**Fetters** : Fetters are manacles fitted around the ankles rather than the wrists, and use the same rules for breaking, escape, and cost relative to size. A creature in fetters is entangled and can only move at half speed. In addition, a fettered creature must succeed at a DC 15 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) check to move more than its (reduced) speed in a round. If it fails the check by 5 or more, the creature falls prone.

**Hobgoblin War Draught** : This drink is a foul-smelling alchemical blend of raw alcohol, mashed grubs, and medicinal mushrooms. A hobgoblin under the effects of hobgoblin war draught ignores all penalties resulting from the fatigued and shaken conditions for 10 minutes, after which he must succeed at a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 hour. Anyone lacking the goblinoid subtype who drinks hobgoblin war draught must immediately make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 hour; success means the drinker ignores all penalties resulting from the fatigued and shaken conditions for 1 minute, after which he is sickened for 10 minutes. Hobgoblin war draught has no effect on creatures that are immune to poison.

**Manacle Barbs** : Barbs added to these manacles wound a captive who does more than move slowly and with care. A creature secured in barbed manacles takes 1 point of piercing damage if it takes more than a single move action during a round. Rough movement of any kind, such as being struck in combat or falling prone, likewise causes 1 point of damage. Attempting to break out of barbed manacles with a Strength check deals 1d4 points of piercing damage to the captive regardless of the success of the attempt.

Fetters can also be fitted with barbs, but the wearer can avoid damage by not taking actions that involve moving its legs. Hobgoblins often use such fetters to secure artisans to their worktables. Securing a captive with multiple sets of manacles and/or fetters doesn't cause additional damage.

**Unstable Accelerant** : A volatile mix of incendiary reagents, unstable accelerant can be thrown just like alchemist's fire. In the hands of an alchemist, a flask of unstable accelerant can be used as part of creating a bomb, increasing its fire damage by +1d6 points. It has no effect on bombs that do not deal fire damage. If the bomb lasts for more than an instant, the extra damage only applies to the first round's damage.

[Hobgoblin Equipment]
| Item | Cost | Weight | Craft DC |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Brewed reek | 40 gp | 1 lb. | DC 25 |
| Fetters | 15 gp | 2 lbs. | — |
| Fetters, masterwork | 50 gp | 2 lbs. | — |
| Hobgoblin war draught | 10 gp | 1 lb. | DC 20\* |
| Manacle barbs | +15 gp | 1 lb. | — |
| Unstable accelerant | 50 gp | 1/2 lb. | DC 25 |

## Hobgoblin Feats

Hobgoblins have access to the following feats.

### Deafening Explosion

Your bombs explode with deafening force.

**Prerequisites** : Bomb class feature, hobgoblin.

**Benefit** : You may reduce your bomb damage by one die to give it the ability to deafen the creature struck by it. The bomb must deal fire, force, or sonic damage. If a creature takes a direct hit from your bomb, it must make a saving throw against the bomb's DC or be deafened for 1 minute. This deafening is in addition to any other effects the bomb would normally have.

### Demoralizing Lash (Combat)

You cow your enemies with the lash of a whip.

**Prerequisites** : Base attack bonus +1, [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) 1 rank, hobgoblin.

**Benefit** : To use this feat, you must use a whip (or another weapon in the flails fighter weapon group) to attack a foe demoralized by an [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) check. If the attack hits, you extend the duration the creature is shaken by 1 round. This feat has no effect on creatures whose shaken conditions are from sources other than [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks.

### Focusing Blow (Teamwork)

You and your allies work together to shake off mental effects.

**Prerequisites** : Hobgoblin Discipline, hobgoblin.

**Benefit** : An ally who also has this feat can deal damage to you in order to break an ongoing mind-affecting effect that allows a saving throw. The ally must cause at least 5 points of damage to you with an attack, spell, or other ability. You then reroll your saving throw, with a +1 bonus for every 5 additional points of damage the attack caused. If your save is successful, the mind-affecting effect ends. Only damage actually dealt counts for purposes of this feat; nonlethal damage and damage reduced or eliminated by damage reduction, resistances, and so on does not qualify.

### Hobgoblin Discipline

The presence of other hobgoblins bolsters your resolve.

**Prerequisites** : Base attack bonus +1, hobgoblin.

**Benefit** : While you are within 30 feet of at least two other hobgoblins, you gain a +1 morale bonus on saving throws.

### Taskmaster (Combat)

You intimidate weaker allies into reckless ferocity.

**Prerequisites** : Demoralizing Lash, [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) 5 ranks, hobgoblin.

**Benefit** : As a standard action, you spur an ally, who must have fewer Hit Dice than yourself, to reckless effort. For 1 minute, the ally gains a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and Will saves against mind-affecting effects. However, the ally also takes a –2 penalty to AC and on skill checks. To affect an unwilling ally, you must succeed at an [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) check with the same DC used to demoralize your ally.

**Special** : If you have 10 or more ranks in [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate), the morale bonus increases to +2.

### Terrorizing Display (Combat)

Your battle prowess frightens friend and foe alike.

**Prerequisites** : Dazzling Display, Demoralizing Lash, Taskmaster, [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus), [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) 10 ranks, hobgoblin, proficiency with selected weapon.

**Benefits** : When you use Dazzling Display, in addition to its normal effects, you can use it to spur allies within 30 feet as if you had used the Taskmaster feat. Use the same [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) check to determine the effects of Dazzling Display and this feat.

## Hobgoblin Magic Items

Hobgoblins have access to the following weapon special abilities and magic items.

**Cruel (weapon special ability)** : A _cruel_ weapon feeds on fear and suffering. When the wielder strikes a creature that is frightened, shaken, or panicked with a _cruel_ weapon, that creature becomes sickened for 1 round. When the wielder uses the weapon to knock unconscious or kill a creature, he gains 5 temporary hit points that last for 10 minutes.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feats#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [cause fear](spells/causeFear#_cause-fear)_, _ [death knell](spells/deathKnell#_death-knell)_; Price +1 bonus.

**Deadly (weapon special ability)** : This special ability can only be placed on weapons that normally deal nonlethal damage, such as whips and saps. All damage a _deadly _weapon deals is lethal damage. A whip (or similar weapon that cannot damage creatures with armor or natural armor bonuses) with this special ability deals damage even to creatures with armor or natural armor. On command, the weapon suppresses this ability until told to resume it.

Faint necromancy; CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feats#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [inflict light wounds](spells/inflictLightWounds#_inflict-light-wounds)_; Price +1 bonus.

Hobgoblin Battle Standard

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 50,000 gp (despair), 60,000 gp (ferocity), 45,000 gp (iron resolve); **Weight** 3 lbs.

Description

A battle standard is a cloth flag or standard, typically 2 feet wide and 4 feet long, meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when lying on the ground. _Hobgoblin battle standards_ normally depict the device or insignia of a tribe or nation, and different types of standards grant different effects.

A battle standard may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the standard does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.

> _Despair_: Enemies of the bearer of a _hobgoblin battle standard of despair_ are sickened while within 60 feet of the banner. Any enemy that sustains a critical hit while sickened because of the standard must succeed at a Will saving throw (DC 15) or become dazed for 1 round.
> 
> _Ferocity_: Allies of the bearer of a _hobgoblin battle standard of ferocity_ gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saving throws against mind-affecting effects as long as they are within 60 feet of the banner.
> 
> _Iron Resolve_: Allies of the bearer of a _hobgoblin battle standard of iron resolve_ gain 10 temporary hit points and the benefits of the Diehard feat for as long as they are within 30 feet of the banner. The temporary hit points can only be gained once per day per creature.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [crushing despair](spells/crushingDespair#_crushing-despair) _(despair), _ [rage](spells/rage#_rage)_ (ferocity), _ [aid](spells/aid#_aid)_ and _ [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance#_bear-s-endurance)_ (iron resolve); **Cost** 25,000 gp (despair), 30,000 gp (ferocity), 22,500 gp (iron resolve)

Horseshoes of Crushing Blows

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** feet; **Price** 4,000 gp (+1), 16,000 gp (+2), 36,000 gp (+3), 64,000 gp (+4), 100,000 gp (+5); **Weight** 4 lbs. (for four)

Description

_Horseshoes of crushing blows_ grant an enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls made with hoof attacks; this bonus varies based on the item's price. Alternatively, as described for the _ [amulet of mighty fists](magicItems/wondrousItems#_amulet-of-mighty-fists),_ they can grant melee weapon special abilities so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. _Horseshoes of crushing blows_ cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. _Horseshoes of crushing blows_ are crafted as sets of four, with each shoe in the set bearing the same enhancements. All four shoes must be worn by the same animal to be effective.

_Horseshoes of crushing blows_ may be crafted out of special materials, gaining the usual benefits. For purposes of pricing, they count as a single one-handed weapon weighing 4 pounds (for example, _adamantine horseshoes of crushing blows_ would cost an additional 3,000 gp). The materials needed to make _cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows_ add no extra costs in and of themselves, but enhancing _cold iron horseshoes of crushing blows_ increases the price by the usual 2,000 gp.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feats#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), creator's caster level must be at least three times the amulet's bonus, plus any requirements of the melee weapon special abilities; **Cost** 2,000 gp (+1), 8,000 gp (+2), 18,000 gp (+3), 32,000 gp (+4), 50,000 gp (+5)

Shackles of Durance Vile

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 9th

**Slot** wrists; **Price** 16,200 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Description

These masterwork iron manacles sap the will of their wearer. When attached to a humanoid creature as their command word is spoken, they affect their prisoner with a _ [dominate person](spells/dominatePerson#_dominate-person)_ spell, except that if the prisoner fails its saving throw, the effect lasts for as long as the shackles are attached. Removing or destroying the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The shackles can be so used once per day. _Shackles of durance vile_ can only be activated against a helpless, restrained, or willing creature; if attached to a creature still able to resist they function only as manacles, albeit superior ones. _Shackles of durance vile_ have hardness 15, 20 hit points, and a superior lock. They have a break DC of 30 and an [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) DC of 35.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [dominate person](spells/dominatePerson#_dominate-person)_; **Cost** 8,200 gp

Wound Paste

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Description

Prized by slavers as an affordable way to stop a captive from bleeding to death, a dose of _wound paste_ acts as a _ [stabilize](spells/stabilize#_stabilize)_ spell when slathered on a dying creature. Applying _wound paste_ is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity. A pot of _wound paste_ contains 5 doses.

Construction

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [stabilize](spells/stabilize#_stabilize)_; **Cost** 25 gp

## Hobgoblin Spells

Hobgoblins have access to the following spell.

Agonizing Rebuke

**School** illusion (phantasm) [emotion, mind-affecting]; **Level** antipaladin 2, cleric 3, inquisitor 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 level)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes.

With a word and a gesture, you instill such apprehension about attacking you in your target that doing so causes it mental distress and pain. Each time the target makes an attack against you, targets you with a harmful spell, or otherwise takes and action that would harm you, it takes 2d6 points of nonlethal damage.
