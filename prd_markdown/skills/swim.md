# Swim

## ( [Str](../gettingStarted.html#_strength); Armor Check Penalty)

You know how to swim and can do so even in stormy water.

**Check** : Make a Swim check once per round while you are in the water. Success means you may swim at up to half your speed (as a full-round action) or at a quarter of your speed (as a move action). If you fail by 4 or less, you make no progress. If you fail by 5 or more, you go underwater.

If you are underwater, either because you failed a Swim check or because you are swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your breath. You can hold your breath for a number of rounds equal to twice your [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) score, but only if you do nothing other than take move actions or free actions. If you take a standard action or a full-round action (such as making an attack), the remainder of the duration for which you can hold your breath is reduced by 1 round. (Effectively, a character in combat can hold his breath only half as long as normal.) After that period of time, you must make a DC 10 [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) check every round to continue holding your breath. Each round, the DC for that check increases by 1. If you fail the [Constitution](../gettingStarted.html#_constitution) check, you begin to drown. The DC for the Swim check depends on the water, as given on the table below.

| Water | Swim DC |
| --- | --- |
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Calm water</td>
<td>10</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Rough water</td>
<td>15</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Stormy water</td>
<td>20*</td>
</tr>
</tbody>

Each hour that you swim, you must make a DC 20 Swim check or take 1d6 points of nonlethal damage from fatigue.

**Action** : A successful Swim check allows you to swim a quarter of your speed as a move action or half your speed as a full-round action.

**Special** : A creature with a swim speed can move through water at its indicated speed without making Swim checks. It gains a +8 racial bonus on any Swim check to perform a special action or avoid a hazard. The creature can always choose to take 10 on a Swim check, even if distracted or endangered when swimming. Such a creature can use the run action while swimming, provided that it swims in a straight line.

If you have the [Athletic](../feats.html#_athletic) feat, you get a bonus on Swim checks (see [Feats](../feats.html)).
