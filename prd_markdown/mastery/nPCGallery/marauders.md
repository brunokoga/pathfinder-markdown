# Marauders

Raiders and bloodthirsty savages who prey upon the fringes of empires, marauders view themselves as the unbridled lords of land and sea. From horseback, grim vessels, or on foot, these deadly warriors strike back against the encroachments of law and civilization, wresting food, wealth, and whatever other spoils they please from proud or unwary victims. Many marauders find themselves spearheading a clash between cultures, a conflict not pursued for evil reasons but due to misunderstandings, expanding borders, or dwindling resources, and they refuse to stand down without a fight.

Raiders are the children of the raging storm, wild warriors from the wrinkled hills and jagged mountains. They descend from their aeries with moods as foul and war cries as terrifying as the wild weather that drives them, leaping, scaling the heights, diving from cover to cover, and raining death upon their enemies.

Raiders can be used as skirmishers or scouts, or they can represent any sort of bandits or wild men from the hills who strike the outlying bastions of civilization without warning.

Raiders are often found alone but may travel with a monster hunter (CR 7) or in pairs with a viking (CR 9). Six raiders might form a raiding party with a chieftain, or serve as a chieftain's honor guard (CR 12).

**Boon** Vikings can provide fairly safe sea passage to any port within a 1-week sail and can grant a +2 circumstance bonus on the PCs' [Survival](../../skills/survival.html#_survival) checks during that voyage.

Vikings are riders of the waves, marauding plunderers from the frozen northern lands who are always ready to pillage with axe and spear and blazing torch. They are boastful and proud, shouting battle cries to their savage gods for the glory of combat. Vikings can serve as elite marines or mobile shock troops. A lone viking may travel with a minstrel to chronicle his journeys (CR 8) or with a first mate and captain (CR 12), while five vikings might serve as honor guard to a chieftain (CR 13).

**Boon** A pirate captain can arrange safe passage to virtually anywhere in the world reachable by ship.

Pirate captains are the deadly mistresses of pirate bands, villainous cutthroats who have cursed, looted, ravaged, betrayed, and carved their way to the top. These steel-handed stingrays lead their crews by sheer force of will. Pirate captains make excellent champion pit fighters and deadly assassins. A pirate captain is usually found with a first mate and a dozen shipmates (CR 12).
