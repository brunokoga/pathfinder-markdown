# Scholars

More than merely elusive sages and hermetic wizards, academics and intellectuals might be found anywhere secrets wait to be uncovered. From universities of higher learning to the ruins of forgotten civilizations, researchers endlessly pursue new discoveries, either for the sake of scholarship or for their own personal fame. Tenacious mages test the boundaries of magic, risking their lives and sanity for the chance at greater power. No matter the mystery, one can rest assured that somewhere experts wait to test their minds against new challenges.

**Boon** A hedge wizard can make alchemical items, brew potions, or scribe scrolls for the PCs at half cost. A hedge wizard can also share knowledge about the local area, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (geography), [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (history), [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (local), or [Profession](../../skills/profession#_profession) (herbalist) checks made in the local region.

A hedge wizard is a local dabbler in magic, sometimes a hermit or recluse wanting only privacy, but often a local loremaster or apothecary whose studies include both the natural and the supernatural.

Hedge wizards can serve as alchemists, sages, and scholars, or operate a curiosity shop or trading post dealing in magical and mundane items.

A hedge wizard might apprentice with a conjurist or hermit (CR 7) or partner with a medium as mystical advisors to a mayor (CR 9). Two cultists might be found working with a hedge wizard (CR 6), or a hedge wizard may work with a pilgrim and two acolytes to administer to a remote village (CR 6).

**Boon** An archaeologist can tell PCs secrets of ruins and relics of a specific ancient culture, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on [Appraise](../../skills/appraise#_appraise), [Spellcraft](../../skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft), and [Use Magic Device](../../skills/useMagicDevice#_use-magic-device) checks to identify items relating to that culture, as well as [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (engineering), [Perception](../../skills/perception#_perception), and [Disable Device](../../skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) checks when dealing with traps or secret doors in a ruin from that culture.

An archaeologist is a cunning scholar and explorer of ancient texts and ruins. She is knowledgeable in a wide range of fields, as quick with a quip or quotation as with a blade, bolt, or lash. An archaeologist might partner with a medium to placate the spirits of the dead disturbed in her explorations (CR 7), or supply a traveling merchant with exotic relics (CR 8).

**Boon** A sage can translate any foreign language for PCs or make up to five skill checks (including identifying magic items) for PCs. A sage can also craft magic items at a 10% discount.

A sage is an academic of the first order. Both a polyglot and polymath, a sage can be consulted to answer any number of questions by anyone wealthy enough to afford her considerable fees. A sage is often accompanied by a merchant prince who procures all the research materials she desires (CR 12), and together they may sit on the small council of a queen (CR 13) or king (CR 15).
