# Adventurers

Rapscallions, hired hands, monster hunters, tomb raiders, champions, and scoundrels, adventurers come with all manner of skills and agendas. While they might be questing heroes seeking to thwart villains and right wrongs, they might also be dangerous thieves seeking to make a fortune in valuable relics. These NPCs can serve as allies for a PC party or even as hirelings for a day or a single dungeon crawl. Alternately, they could be rival adventurers seeking to thwart the PCs in their own mission. Whether as allies or rivals, these NPCs might appear any time a party comes to realize they aren't the only adventurers around.

**Boon** A battle mage can create scrolls at a 10% discount.

A battle mage is always ready for a fight. She knows that the one who strikes first strikes best. Never lacking in firepower, her versatility on the battlefield is always appreciated. Battle mages make excellent military fire support and magical bodyguards. They can be found alone, guarding a traveling merchant (CR 7) or guide (CR 8) or adventuring with a medium or minstrel, monster hunter or gladiator, and tomb raider (CR 9). A squad of four battle mages (CR 9) might be attached to an army.

**Boon** A monster hunter can locate and track a particular wild beast or monster, leading the PCs to its lair.

A monster hunter is a clever, experienced hunter, riding the forest trails with her faithful hawk serving as her eyes above. Whether seeking a reward or bounty, an impressive trophy, or simply an epic fireside tale of the hunt, a monster hunter seldom rests or tarries long when she hears whispered tales of wild things on the prowl. Monster hunters can be outriders and protectors of the wilderness or skilled hunters. Different types of monster hunters can be easily created by changing the monster hunter's favored enemy, favored terrain, or animal companion.

A merchant prince often has a pair of monster hunters on payroll (CR 10) to dispose of threats to business. Patrols of four monster hunters (CR 9) might serve as wilderness border guards A monster hunter may also adventure with a battle mage, a medium or minstrel, and a tomb raider (CR 9).

**Boon** A tomb raider could agree to appraise the PCs' goods or to travel with them and disable a trap.

Tomb raiders are cunning explorers of ruined delves and trap-haunted dungeons and daring looters of ancient, treasure-laden crypts. They are invaluable allies, helping any would-be explorers get in and out without falling prey to lurking death and hidden danger. Of course, if a tomb raider should happen to find and keep the choicest bits for himself, who would know? He would never tell. A tomb raider might also be found as a rival inside a dungeon, perhaps seeking to loot the treasure inside before the PCs can. Replacing his [Sleight of Hand](../../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand) skill with [Craft](../../skills/craft.html#_craft) (trapmaking) makes him an even more dangerous foe.

Tomb raiders make excellent burglars and scouts. A tomb raider often works alone, but he may also cooperate with an archaeologist and a pair of burglars (CR 8). A tomb raider scout might be found with a monster hunter (CR 7) or even with a group of four raiders (CR 9). Adventuring tomb raiders often travel with a medium or minstrel, a battle mage, and a gladiator or monster hunter (CR 9).
