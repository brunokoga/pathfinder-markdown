# Frontier

At the edge of civilization, grim individuals scrape a harsh life from unforgiving lands. These masters of the wilderness learn the ways of their chosen lands, forgoing the comforts of cities and cultured company for peace and simplicity among beasts and nature. While some are mere visitors to frontier lands, guiding others or hunting for resources, others are true denizens of the wilds, as at home in nature as any untamed beast—and in many ways, just as dangerous.

**Boon** Trappers can provide food for the PCs for 1 week and can tell them secrets of the wild lands where they live, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on [Survival](../../skills/survival.html#_survival) checks within a 20-mile radius.

Trappers are roving hunters who wander the woods. They take any animal they can safely hunt or trap, but they are best known as the heart of the fur trade, making a variety of handcrafted but deadly effective traps to catch the unwary beasts of the forest. Trappers could be used as royal game wardens, as scouts, or as hunters for a nomadic tribe.

Trappers are typically loners but will sometimes pair up with another trapper (CR 5), a monster hunter (CR 6), or a beast master (CR 7) for companionship.

**Boon** A hermit can offer healing, food, and shelter for up to a week. A hermit can also arrange a meeting with a sentient creature or wilderness NPC with a +5 bonus on related [Diplomacy](../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy) checks due to the hermit's reputation.

Hermits are lonely dwellers in the wilderness, eking out an existence in harmony with nature and delighting in their solitude, far from the noise and bustle of civilization. Hermits can act as woodland sentinels, spying on trespassers. Hermits rarely have companions other than animals, but they may occasionally have a pilgrim or a pair of vagabonds as guests (CR 7) or take counsel with a shaman and beast master (CR 9) whose tribe lives nearby.

**Boon** A guide can track a particular creature or lead the PCs safely through a wilderness area for up to 3 days.

Guides are trailblazers and pathfinders, master trackers and experts at finding their way through the wilderness. They are outriders and scouts par excellence, but they leave the heavy fighting to others, preferring to snipe from long range while keeping well out of harm's way.

Guides might also be used as highly-skilled long-range messengers, or perhaps members of a specially trained royal courier corps. Guides might also serve as elite dragoons or mounted infantry in a powerful army.

A single guide may be encountered escorting two pilgrims (CR 8) or a pair of traveling merchants and their sellsword bodyguard (CR 10), or she might lead an entire caravan, with eight caravan guards and eight vagabonds (CR 10). A guide might also partner with a monster hunter or minstrel (CR 8) or two knights hunting evil in the wilderness (CR 9). A wise guide frequently works with a pair of trappers who are intimately familiar with an area (CR 8).
