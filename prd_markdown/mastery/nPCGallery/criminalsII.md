# Criminals II

The artists and masterminds of all manner of illicit ventures, these criminals make a career of their lawless trades, flaunting the law and gambling with the lives of others for their own gain. While not always outright evil, such characters prove more concerned with themselves than any matter of morality or legality, and they possess the cunning, force of will, or foresight to either dupe or avoid agents of the law. Typically groups of less organized or skilled criminals serve these kingpins, though in some cases, true masters of the illicit arts prefer to work alone.

**Boon** Slavers can provide information on slave-trading routes, major customers, and the likely location of specific enslaved individuals, providing a +2 circumstance bonus on [Diplomacy](../../skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) checks to gather information about such topics.

Slavers are the scourge of free societies, sneaking into towns and villages by night and capturing the innocent, spiriting them away to underground slave markets or taking them by ship to mines, plantations, and pleasure palaces across the sea.

Slavers can also be used as riot police, low-level bounty hunters, exotic gladiators, or any kind of guard or soldier who prefers to capture opponents rather than kill them.

Slavers will sometimes employ a pair of prostitutes to inveigle their victims into a compromising position (CR 5) or a pair of street thugs to help overpower victims (CR 5). Slavers might also be found with captured slaves; these slaves could be any of the NPCs in this chapter, such as commoners or aristocrats.

**Boon** Slayers can obtain poisons for the PCs at a 20% discount. They can also arrange to kill or capture targets for the PCs' for 20% less than their usual fee (as determined by the GM).

Slayers are cold-blooded killers, assassins for hire. They are cunning tricksters, deadly snipers, masters of the knife in the back and the storm of shuriken whistling from either hand. Slayers may also be used as ninjas, spies, or particularly deadly enforcers.

Slayers often work alone, sometimes as chief enforcer for a guild master (CR 11), but many work with accomplices, such as three burglars (CR 9), a pair of highwaymen (CR 10), or a half-dozen slavers (CR 10).

**Boon** A guild master can arrange to smuggle people or items into or out of secured areas, can command a robbery, break-in, or assault on a target, or can arrange to buy or sell illegal items (treat gp limit as that of a community one size category larger).

Guild masters are crime lords par excellence. They are masters of every criminal art and have worked their way up from being common hoods to become cunning masterminds of their own organization. Guild masters can serve as spies, assassins, or master safecrackers, or as bandit lords or shady merchant princes.

A guild master often keeps a slayer or two as bodyguards and enforcers (CR 11 or 12), but some with more flamboyance prefer to keep a gladiatorial champion and sellsword (CR 12) or half a dozen sellswords (CR 13). A guild master may also be found in the company of a pair of nobles or merchant princes of uncertain morals (CR 11).
