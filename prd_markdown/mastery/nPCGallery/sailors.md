# Sailors

Plying the seas and facing danger in pursuit of wealth, adventure, or merely the freedom of the waves, professional sailors arise from every port and ship upon nearly every ocean. Whether as salty sea dogs, hardened marines, sailing traders, seasoned captains, or deadly pirates, those with experience before the mast and skill at reading the tempers of the seas might find new journeys wherever the tides sweep them. The sea breeds colorful characters and seems to harden those who ride its waves, bringing some to nobility and sinking others to the black-hearted depths of cruelty.

**Boon** A shipmate can smuggle a small item onto or off of a ship, or help PCs get on or off of a ship by creating a distraction for any other watchers (–4 on [Perception](../../skills/perception.html#_perception) checks to notice the PCs for up to 1 minute).

Shipmates are ordinary sailors, the rank-and-file deckhands who keep any vessel, great or small, afloat and moving. They are alert for danger and quick on their feet, weathered by wind and wave and sun, but always with an eye for what waits beyond the horizon.

Shipmates can be used as low-level marines, rivermen, bargefolk, or even swamp rats living in stilt-houses.

Replacing a shipmate's [Dodge](../../feats.html#_dodge) feat with [Athletic](../../feats.html#_athletic) reduces his AC and CMD by 1, but increases his [Climb](../../skills/climb.html#_climb) and [Swim](../../skills/swim.html#_swim) skills by 2 each. Replacing his [Profession](../../skills/profession.html#_profession) (fisherman) skill with ranks in [Linguistics](../../skills/linguistics.html#_linguistics) or a [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) skill creates a sailor who has traveled the world and has knowledge of distant lands or languages.

On board a ship, shipmates might serve as crew for a variety of characters: eight shipmates could work for an evil slaver (CR 6), a seagoing traveling merchant (CR 7), a marauding viking (CR 8), or a pirate captain and her first mate (CR 12).

Away from seagoing vessels, six shipmates could form a press gang looking for easy prey to add to a pirate ship's crew (CR 4). A single shipmate might be found in the company of a barmaid (CR 1), or with a vagabond or storyteller (CR 2). A pair of shipmates might take up with a drunkard or prostitute while on shore leave (CR 3).

**Boon** A first mate can arrange for PCs to meet with a captain or merchant prince of their acquaintance, with a +2 circumstance bonus on [Diplomacy](../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy) checks because of the first mate's reputation. He can also accompany PCs with a longboat and crew of four shipmates for up to 1 day.

A first mate is the loyal assistant to a ship's captain. He oversees duties and discipline aboard ship, feared but always respected; he is able to entertain with a sea shanty one moment and ply his trusty lash or flashing cutlasses the next. A first mate could also be the warden of an exotic island prison. Away from their ships, first mates can be found with a traveling merchant quartermaster (CR 9), or a captain (CR 12).

**Boon** A captain can arrange sea passage for PCs or cargo to any navigable destination, and can help PCs find directions to obscure destinations (+5 bonus on [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [geography] or other related checks). Captains working for a larger group can also issue legal decrees in their name.

A captain is mistress of a ship at sea. She may be the legal authority and representative of her nation, company, faith, or faction, or she may be an independent captain owing allegiance to none and claiming no home but the sea itself. Captains may be used as pirates, admirals, or master merchants. A captain is usually accompanied by a first mate and a traveling merchant as quartermaster (CR 12).
