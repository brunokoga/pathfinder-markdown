# Entertainers

Performers of all walks lighten the daily burden of common folk with tales and song, comedy and drama. Yet, within the power of such skilled players also lies the ability to spread news and knowledge, rally the spirit, or incite revolution. Entertainers take a wide variety of forms, from comedians and wandering bards, to evangelists and skilled orators, to fools and scholars. Whatever their path, when entertainers talk, the people listen.

A storyteller is a traveling raconteur, a collector and performer of tall tales, epic poems, and ancient history. They move from town to town reciting their repertoire and picking up new bits of lore and gossip to pass on at the next town. Taverns and inns frequently contain a storyteller entertaining patrons, but storytellers can also be found performing on the street or in market squares. A storyteller could be used as a town crier or herald, or as a revolutionary or rabble-rouser working to stir up public opinion.

A storyteller can be found working for a barkeep (CR 4) or traveling with an out-of-work caravan guard (CR 3).

A minstrel is a professional bard, an accomplished performer used to playing at festivals and lordly tables. He is a versatile performer but specializes in song, story, and especially the playing of the lute, lyre, harp, and other stringed instruments.

A minstrel down on his luck might play for a barkeep (CR 6). Two minstrels could be the apprentices of a celebrity bard (CR 11), while a troupe of three minstrels might play for a noble (CR 10) or even a king and queen (CR 15).
