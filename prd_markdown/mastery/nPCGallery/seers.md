# Seers

Beyond the world of the mundane lie truths and mysteries veiled from mortal eyes. Yet some possess the insight and art to gaze past the veneer of supposed reality, taking in realms both wondrous and terrible. Touched by the gods, magic, or madness, these seers stand apart from other mortals, viewing their powers as blessings or curses even as they explore the interweaving threads of fate and treat with the powers of realms beyond.

**Boon** A doomsayer can spread word of the party's fearsome reputation, granting a +2 circumstance bonus on [Intimidate](../../skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) checks in that community for 1 week. A doomsayer can also scribe scrolls for PCs at a 10% discount.

Doomsayers are ranting demagogues who continuously predict doom, cataclysm, and ruin, crying in the town square and distributing pamphlets in literate communities. A doomsayer may build up a cult of personality, but they are happiest when they can ensure that others are miserable.

Doomsayers can be used as primitive witch doctors or shamans, dark cultists, witches, or rough frontier “priests” in remote villages or other areas without organized clergy.

A doomsayer often keeps a pair of acolytes or beggars as disciples (CR 3 or 4), or works with a group of three wanderers or cultists (CR 6). A doomsayer might also be apprenticed to a hedge wizard (CR 5), while an urban doomsayer could partner with a gang of four pickpockets (CR 4) who work the crowd that gathers to hear the doomsayer speak. Replacing [Skill Focus](../../feats.md#_skill-focus) ( [Intimidate](../../skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate)) with [Skill Focus](../../feats.md#_skill-focus) ( [Heal](../../skills/heal.md#_heal)) creates a lay healer who might be found with a pilgrim (CR 4).

A medium is a speaker who bridges the worlds of the living and the dead. She proclaims rest and blesses gravesites, ushering in birth and consigning the dead to the ground, yet it is also her seance that recalls the shades of the lost and ensures the continuity of a community's past, present, and future.

A medium could be a village priestess or wise woman, or can simply be used as a generic wandering cleric, or one of many low-to-mid-level priests staffing a temple.

A medium might be accompanied by two acolytes or a doomsayer (CR 5), or two cultists (CR 6). A medium and hedge wizard (CR 6), hermit (CR 7), or conjurist (CR 7) could preside over a forest oracle or be traveling mendicant mystics. A medium and two acolytes might accompany a priest (CR 9), while five or six mediums could form the entourage for a saint (CR 12) or high priest (CR 13).
