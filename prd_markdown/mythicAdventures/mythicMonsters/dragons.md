Special Abilities

**Corrupt Water (Sp)** Once per day, a black dragon can stagnate 10 cubic feet of still water within 210 feet, making it foul and unable to support water-breathing life. The ability spoils liquids containing water. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a Will save (DC 21) or become ruined. This ability is the equivalent of a 1st-level spell.

**Swamp Stride (Ex)** A black dragon can move through bogs and quicksand without penalty at its normal speed.

**Water Breathing (Ex)** A black dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon), spells, and other abilities while submerged.

A mythic black dragon eyes can pierce fog to find prey. Its very flesh and blood is infused with deadly acid, and like a snake it can gulp down an entire meal without chewing. A mythic black dragon enjoys regurgitating a swallowed opponent to let it rot for a few days before eating it as an actual meal, or repeats this cycle on a living creature as cruel torture.

Special Abilities

**Bend Bolt (Su)** By expending one use of mythic power, a mythic blue dragon can bend the line of its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) once up to 90 degrees, and cause any creature that fails its save against the [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) to be stunned for 1 round.

**Desert Thirst (Su)** A blue dragon can cast _ [create water](spells/createWater.md#_create-water)_ at will (CL equals its HD). Alternatively, it can destroy an equal amount of liquid in a 10-foot burst. Unattended liquids are instantly reduced to sand. Liquid-based magic items (such as potions) and items in a creature's possession must succeed at a DC 22 Will save or be destroyed. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Dust Cloud (Ex)** Sand and dust swirls around a mythic blue dragon's body, attracted by its natural electrical charge. This provides the dragon with concealment but doesn't interfere with the dragon's senses or attacks in any way.

**Persuasive Whisper (Sp)** A mythic blue dragon can expend one use of mythic power to use _ [charm person](spells/charmPerson.md#_charm-person)_ or _ [suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion)_. Its caster level for these abilities is equal to its Hit Dice.

**Sound Imitation (Ex)** A very young or older blue dragon can mimic any voice or sound it has heard by making a successful [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff) check against a listener's [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) check.

A mythic blue dragon has powers over weaker minds, allowing it to influence events far from its lair. Its magic also influences sand and dust, giving it mastery over the aspects of its desert home.

Special Abilities

**Camouflage (Ex)** The dragon can use [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) to hide in any sort of natural terrain, even if the terrain does not grant cover or concealment.

**Delirious Breath (Su)** Creatures who fail their saves against the dragon's [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) are either confused or nauseated for 1 round. The dragon chooses which effect to apply when it uses its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon), and it can use only one effect per breath.

**Water Breathing (Ex)** A green dragon can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon), spells, and other abilities while submerged.

A mythic green dragon embodies the confusion and fear of becoming lost in a strange forest. It stalks its prey with surprising stealth and subterfuge, preferring the taste of terrified, maddened creatures.

Special Abilities

**Fire Aura (Su)** A wyrm red dragon is surrounded by an aura of intense heat. All creatures within 10 feet take 2d6 points of fire damage at the beginning of the dragon's turn.

**Manipulate Flames (Su)** A wyrm red dragon can control any fire spell within 110 feet of the dragon as a standard action. This ability allows it to move any fire effect in the area, as if it were the caster. This ability also allows it to reposition a stationary fire effect, although the new placement must be one allowed by the spell. Finally, for 1 round following the use of this ability, the dragon can control any new fire spell cast within its area of control, as if it were the caster. It can make all decisions allowed to the caster, including canceling the spell if it so desires.

**Melt Stone (Su)** The dragon can use its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) to melt rock at a range of 100 feet, affecting a 55-foot-radius area. The area becomes lava to a depth of 1 foot. Any creature in contact with the lava takes 20d6 points of fire damage on the first round, 10d6 on the second, and none thereafter as the lava hardens and cools. If used on a wall or ceiling, treat this ability as an avalanche that deals fire damage.

Few creatures inspire such dread as the magnificently wrathful red dragons, and the ones with mythic power are even more fearful. They are the embodiments of destruction, hatred, and draconic arrogance. Magnificent and utterly frightening to behold, mythic red dragons possess a fierce beauty that exceeds all other dragons. From their powerful jaws, capable of snapping iron bars and the masts of ships, to their muscular tails, which can crash through stone walls as easily as whips break skin, red dragons reflect predatory superiority and murderous perfection. A mythic red dragon's body has cordlike muscles that allow it to move more quickly and gracefully than a creature of its size should have a right to.

Villains of the worst kind, mythic red dragons are unflinchingly evil in ways rarely matched even by other mythic evil creatures. Their destructive impulses and wrathful fiery rampages surprise and delight the most heinous demons. These legendary dragons demand annual royal sacrifices or tribute in slaves, and think nothing of working their underlings to death.

An older mythic red dragon spends little time out of its lair, and when it does emerge it prefers to attack humanoid settlements away from the immediate vicinity, burning down buildings, dropping peasants from great heights, and demanding coins and other treasures. This raiding pattern makes it difficult for would-be dragonslayers to find the creature's actual lair.

Mythic red dragons use their magic to protect their lairs with a variety of protective spells. A typical lair also contains slave-built mundane traps, environmental hazards such as steam vents poisonous fumes, and (if within an active volcano) molten rock as part of its defenses.

Special Abilities

**Ice Shape (Su)** A young white dragon can shape ice and snow at will. This ability functions as _ [stone shape](spells/stoneShape.md#_stone-shape)_, but only targets ice and snow, not stone. A white dragon's caster level for this effect is equal to its Hit Dice.

**Ice Slick (Ex)** Ice and slush persists from a mythic juvenile white dragon's [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon), coating all surfaces in the area and turning the area into difficult terrain for 1 minute per age category. The dragon can breathe at a location beyond its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) range, coating it in ice and slush, instead of damaging creatures, in a radius equal to half its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) range and at a range of 30 feet per age category (a 15-foot burst up to 120 feet for a mythic juvenile white dragon).

**Icewalking (Ex)** This ability works like the _ [spider climb](spells/spiderClimb.md#_spider-climb)_ spell, but the surfaces the dragon climbs must be icy. The dragon can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks to run or charge on ice.

**Power Slide (Ex)** If a mythic juvenile white dragon deals trample damage to one or more opponents on ice, snow, frozen tundra, or a similar slippery surface, it can expend one use of mythic power to attempt an awesome blow combat maneuver against each damaged target, as if it had the [Awesome Blow](monsters/monsterFeats.md#_awesome-blow) monster feat (_Bestiary_ 314).

**Snow Vision (Ex)** A very young white dragon learns to see perfectly well in snowy conditions. A white dragon does not take any penalties on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks while in snow.

A mythic white dragon's powers over ice and snow make it a perfect predator for its environment. Its hunger is barely kept in check by its human-level intelligence. It is fond of crashing into enemies and knocking them into ravines so they can be found and eaten later.
