**Treasure** standard (half-plate, greatsword, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Choking Ash (Su)** Any creature that starts its turn in the giant's aura is nauseated for 1 round (Fortitude DC 23 negates). The ash provides the giant with 50% concealment against ranged attacks. Strong wind or fire-quenching magic disperse it for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Fire Vortex (Su)** A mythic fire giant can expend one use of mythic power to create a vortex of fire within 30 feet. The vortex is 5 feet wide at its base, 15 feet wide at the top, and 30 feet tall. Any creature starting its turn adjacent to the vortex takes 6d6 points of fire damage, and any creature passing through it takes 15d6 fire damage. A successful DC 23 Reflex saving throw halves this damage. The fire giant can move the vortex up to 20 feet as a move action. If the vortex moves through a creature, that creature must succeed at a saving throw against the vortex to avoid taking damage. The vortex lasts for 5 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Lava Weapons (Su)** All melee and ranged attacks made by the fire giant deal an additional 4d6 points of fire damage. This ability replaces the heated rock ability of non-mythic fire giants.

A mythic fire giant burns like the heart of a volcano. Wielding weapons of flame and ash, it brands enemies with its fury and strength.

**Treasure** standard (hide armor, greatclub, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Dense Mind (Ex)** If a mythic hill giant fails its saving throw against a hostile mind-affecting effect, at the start of its turn it automatically expends one use of mythic power (if it has any) as a free action to reroll its saving throw against the effect. It rerolls for each ongoing mind-affecting effect each turn.

**Earth Bond (Ex)** A mythic hill giant gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls, weapon damage rolls, and saves while touching the ground (including a stone or earthen floor in a building). As a standard action, a hill giant touching the ground can expend one use of mythic power to rejuvenate itself, gaining the benefits of _ [cure critical wounds](spells/cureCriticalWounds#_cure-critical-wounds)_ and _ [restoration](spells/restoration#_restoration)_.

**Ground Pound (Ex)** As a standard action, a mythic hill giant can expend one use of mythic power and hit the ground with a bludgeoning weapon. Choose one intersection within reach; creatures touching the ground within a 20-foot burst centered on that intersection take double the damage normally dealt by that bludgeoning weapon (Reflex DC 23 for half). Creatures that fail their saves are knocked prone and moved 5 feet directly away from chosen intersection. This ability has no effect on creatures with the earth bond ability. The save DC is Strength-based.

A mythic hill giant is a relic from an earlier age, smarter than its degenerate kin and gifted with magic of stone and earth. Some seek to rule, creating tribes with their non-mythic kin and using smaller beings as serfs. Others prefer lives of solitude, intolerant of all other creatures.
