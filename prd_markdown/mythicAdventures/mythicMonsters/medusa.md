Special Abilities

**Petrifying Gaze (Su)** Turn to stone permanently, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 18 negates. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Poison (Ex)** Snake bite; _save_ Fort DC 18; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ 1d4 Con; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Poison Weapons (Ex)** A mythic medusa can spend a standard action to apply her snake poison to her sword or to two arrows, and normally poisons her weapons in advance.

**Summon Snake (Sp)** As a full-round action, a mythic medusa can summon an [emperor cobra](additionalMonsters/snake#_snake,-emperor-cobra) or 1d3 [amphisbaenas](additionalMonsters/amphisbaena#_amphisbaena) as if using a [_summon monster_](spells/summonMonster) spell. The summoned snakes are immune to the medusa's gaze attack and remain for 8 rounds before disappearing.

**Unpetrify (Su)** A mythic medusa can expend one use of mythic power to return a petrified creature to life (as if using _ [stone to flesh](spells/stoneToFlesh#_stone-to-flesh)_) for 1 minute. The creature is under the medusa's control (as if using _ [dominate monster](spells/dominateMonster#_dominate-monster)_) and reverts to a statue at the end of this time. If the medusa expends three uses of mythic power, the creature remains unpetrified for 24 hours instead of 1 minute. A typical petrified victim in a mythic medusa's lair is a [half-elf fighter 6](npcCodex/core/fighter#_adventuring-blacksmith) or [human warrior 6](npcCodex/npc/warrior#_grizzled-mercenary).

A mythic medusa is one of the near-immortal progenitors of the medusa race, who mate with humanoids in order to produce weaker (but still deadly) offspring. With deadly poison, power over snakes, and the ability to animate and command those she has turned to stone, a mythic medusa is a dangerous foe who can't be easily overcome by mirrored shields and blindfolds; she waits, strikes, and retreats, allowing her minions and venom to weaken her foes before she is ready to take their lives.
