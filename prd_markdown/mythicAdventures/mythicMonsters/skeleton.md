A mythic skeleton is an animated corpse created with mythic magic such as _mythic [animate dead](spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)_. It has an unnatural cunning that belies its mindless nature and a natural instinct for killing.

## Creating a Mythic Skeleton

"Mythic skeleton" is an acquired template that can be added to any creature with the skeleton template (referred to hereafter as the base skeleton).

[**Mythic Subtype**](mythicAdventures/mythicMonsters.md#_mythic-subtype): A mythic skeleton gains the mythic subtype, with a rank equal to half the CR of the base skeleton. Instead of gaining additional abilities according to its CR, it always gains channel resistance +2, relentless, and superior two-weapon fighting. The mythic skeleton gains all other benefits of having the mythic subtype: ability score bonuses, bonus hit points, mythic feats, mythic power, natural armor bonus, and spell resistance increase (if any).

**CR** : Adjust the base skeleton's CR according to its mythic rank (this template doesn't increase the base skeleton's CR other than from the mythic rank).

**Hit Dice** : A mythic skeleton's Hit Dice are determined as though it were a [zombie](monsters/zombie.md#_zombie) instead of a skeleton.

**Relentless (Ex)** : Any melee attack made against a mythic skeleton provokes an attack of opportunity from the skeleton.

**Superior Two Weapon Fighting (Ex)** : A mythic humanoid skeleton usually fights with a scimitar in each hand. It does not take a penalty on attack or damage rolls for attacking with two weapons.

## Other Mythic Skeletons

Other types of skeletons have the following additional or altered abilities.

**Mythic Bloody Skeleton** : Destroying a mythic bloody skeleton in the area of a non-mythic _ [bless](spells/bless.md#_bless)_ spell doesn't prevent it from returning to unlife.

**Mythic Burning Skeleton** : Add half the burning skeleton's mythic rank to its fiery aura damage and melee attack fire damage. Add its mythic rank to the DC of its fiery death ability.

## Mythic Skeletal Champion

To create a mythic skeletal champion, increase its channel resistance by +2, and add the mythic subtype, additional Hit Dice as if the skeletal champion were a zombie of its size, and mythic abilities according to the base skeletal champion's Hit Dice.
