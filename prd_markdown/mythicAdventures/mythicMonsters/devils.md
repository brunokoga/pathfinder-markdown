**Treasure** standard

Special Abilities

**Bone Eruption (Su)** As a standard action, a mythic bone devil can expend two uses of mythic power to call to the bones of all enemies within a 20-foot-radius burst. The bones shudder and twist within each creature, dealing 10d6 points of damage and giving each creature the sickened condition for 1d6 rounds. A successful DC 20 Fortitude save halves the damage and negates the sickened condition. If this damage kills a creature, some of its bones tear free from its body and fuse with the bone devil, healing it for 1d6 points of damage per Hit Die of the slain creature. Creatures immune to critical hits are immune to this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Pain Blast (Su)** Once per round as a free action, a bone devil can stimulate extreme pain in one creature within its reach. The creature takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks until the start of the devil's next turn or until it moves at least 60 feet away from the devil.

**Poison (Ex)** Sting—injury; _save_ Fort DC 20; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ 1d3 Str damage; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Forged from the souls of the first heretics and blasphemers, mythic devils have an ancient legacy of torture and using secrets to lure mortal diabolists into temptation. A mythic bone devil leads Hell's inquisitors in the efforts to root out disobedience among other devils. The authority it wields is even more powerful than its formidable magic, and it commands respect and fear from even pit fiends and dukes of Hell.

Ecology

**Environment** any (Hell)

**Organization** solitary, team (2–3), council (4–10), or contingent (1–3 ice devils, 2–6 horned devils, and 1–4 bone devils)

**Treasure** standard _(+2 [frost](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-frost) spear_, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**[Cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype) Logic (Su)** When a mythic ice devil's spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_resistance) protects it from a mind-affecting effect, it can expend one use of mythic power as an immediate action to turn that effect upon its source, as if using _ [spell turning](spells/spellTurning#_spell-turning)_.

**Favored Enemy (Ex)** A mythic ice devil can expend one use of mythic power to gain a +6 favored enemy bonus against one type of creature for 1 hour, as if it were a 14th-level ranger.

**Ice Burrowing (Ex)** This ability works like the burrow ability, but only through ice and snow (including magical ice such as a _ [wall of ice](spells/wallOfIce#_wall-of-ice)_).

**Ice Shards (Su)** A mythic ice devil's ice-tipped spear embeds jagged shards of supernaturally cold ice in its target. This functions as [bleed](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_bleed) (1d6), except the damage is cold damage. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to the target removes all ice shards. Creatures with the [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) subtype are immune to this ability.

**Slow (Su)** A hit from a mythic ice devil's tail or spear induces numbing cold. The opponent must succeed at a DC 23 Fortitude save or be affected as though by a _ [slow](spells/slow#_slow)_ spell for 1d6 rounds. This effect comes from the devil, not its weapon; it is not a quality possessed by the spear itself. The save DC is Constitution-based.

A mythic ice devil is a master of strategy, able to adapt to the nature of its opponents and turn its enemy's attacks back at them. Its lean form and upright posture sets it apart from the stockier non-mythic ice devils.
