Special Abilities

**Poison (Ex)** Sting—injury; _save_ DC 17; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ 1d4 Constitution damage; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Power Lift (Ex)** A mythic wyvern can expend one use of mythic power to withdraw as a move action (instead of a full-round action), moving up to its speed instead of double. It can even move straight up. If it's grappling a creature, the wyvern can bring the grappled creature with it. Usually a wyvern uses this ability to carry off its prey and drop it from above onto a hard surface. Since this is a move action, the wyvern can damage its target, withdraw, and drop its target all in the same round.

A mythic wyvern has one or more true dragons in its recent ancestry, making it strong and resilient. Despite its greater power and ego, it is more inclined to accept a rider than other wyverns, perhaps because it recognizes the value of an alliance.

## Variant Mythic Wyverns

Some mythic wyverns are closely related to one specific type of chromatic dragon. These lose their energy resistances and the power lift ability, but gain the energy immunity and breath weapon of the appropriate chromatic dragon (80 foot line or 40 foot cone, DC 17, 8d6 energy damage, 1d4 rounds).
