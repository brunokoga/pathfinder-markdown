Special Abilities

**Goblin King (Su)** A mythic barghest has the inspire courage +2 and inspire competence +2 abilities of a 6th-level bard. Goblins, goblin dogs, worgs, hell hounds, and barghests gain double the normal bonuses from this ability.

**Improved Bite (Ex)** A mythic barghest's bite has a critical threat range of 18–20 and critical multiplier of ×3.

**Vorpal Bite (Su)** If a mythic greater barghest confirms a critical hit against a non-mythic opponent, it can expend one use of mythic power as a free action to bite off the opponent's head, instantly killing it (Fort DC 15 negates). The save DC is Constitution-based.

A mythic greater barghest is a near-divine offspring of one of the barghest gods. Infused with the power of foul planes, it leads great tribes of goblins, scaring their minions into something approaching discipline. Its presence is enough for hobgoblins and bugbears to treat goblins almost as equals, having seen the barghest's wrath at disobedience and infighting.

## Mythic Barghest

Only exceptional barghests that feed on mythic humanoids can become mythic greater barghests. To create a mythic barghest, add the [agile mythic simple template](mythicAdventures/mythicMonsters.md#_agile-mythic) to a non-mythic [barghest](monsters/barghest.md).

If the mythic barghest uses its feed ability on a mythic humanoid's corpse, it gains a mythic growth point instead of a growth point. If a mythic barghest reaches 4 growth points, it transforms into a greater barghest with the agile mythic simple template and loses its mythic growth points. If a mythic barghest gains 4 mythic growth points, it transforms into a mythic greater barghest and loses the agile mythic simple template.
