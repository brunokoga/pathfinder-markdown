Special Abilities

**Contemptuous Toss (Ex)** When a mythic great cyclops uses [Awesome Blow](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/monsterFeats.html#_awesome-blow) and expends a use of mythic power, its target flies up to 60 additional feet and takes 1d6 points of damage for every additional 20 feet traveled. If the cyclops uses its gore attack for this ability, it can hurl the target up to 60 feet upward instead of sideways.

**Earthquake (Su)** A mythic great cyclops can punch the ground and expend two uses of mythic power to cause an _ [earthquake](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/earthquake.html#_earthquake)_ (as the spell). Add the cyclops's rank to the save DCs for the earthquake's effects. Other mythic great cyclopes are not affected by the earthquake.

**Flash of Brutality (Su)** Once per day as a swift action, a great cyclops can gain a burst of savage inspiration. When it does, it doubles the threat range of all weapons, natural attacks, and rocks it attacks with until the start of its next turn. Once per day, when the cyclops reaches 0 or fewer hit points and is conscious because of its [Diehard](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_diehard) feat, this ability recharges, allowing it to use the ability a second time that same day.

Mythic great cyclopes are the first and oldest of their kind to succumb to visions of rage and destruction. Said to be the lost offspring of gods of lightning and the forge, they wield power over earth and energy, using it to blast open humanoid defenses so they can pluck out the tasty morsels within.
