**Disorienting Pounce (Ex)** A creature that a mythic owlbear hits when using its [pounce](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_pounce) ability is automatically staggered for 1 round.

A mythic owlbear may have been created by a mythic mage, or adopted as the favored pet of a mythic druid. Though as short-tempered and bloodthirsty as other owlbears, a mythic owlbear has the sense to avoid or flee foes more powerful than itself.

Though created long ago, the very first owlbear still lives. Fecund, nomadic and cantankerous, the First Owlbear's offspring are always owlbears, whether the mother is a bear, a giant owl, or an owlbear. He brings his "harem" of mates with him when he hunts, driving them off when he tires of their company or food becomes scarce.
