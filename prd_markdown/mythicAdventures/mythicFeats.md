# Mythic Feats

Mythic characters and monsters gain mythic feats as they gain tiers or ranks. These feats can be selected only as part of mythic advancement, not as part of a character's normal advancement or in place of any other bonus feat.

Most mythic feats require a non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. These mythic feats enhance the benefits of their prerequisite feats, making them truly awe-inspiring. If a character doesn't possess any of the necessary prerequisite feats when she gains a mythic feat, she can wait to select a mythic feat until the next time she gains a tier or level.

A value in a mythic feat based on a fraction of your tier (such as a +1 bonus for every 3 tiers you possess) always has a minimum of 1.

This section includes some non-mythic feats. These grant a character who hasn't had a moment of ascension a measure of mythic might, and remain relevant if that character later becomes mythic.

## Types of Feats

Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.

### Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.

### Mythic Feats

Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.

Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.

### Mythic and Metamagic Feats

You'll notice there are no mythic metamagic feats. Because mythic versions of spells are, in a way, metamagic of their own, and there are many mythic abilities that empower such spellcasting, there is no need for mythic metamagic feats. If you desire more potent spellcasting power, select the Mythic Spell Lore feat multiple times.

There is also a non-mythic metamagic feat for casting spells as their mythic versions: Ascendant Spell.

## Feat Descriptions

Mythic feats are summarized in the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feat descriptions for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

**Prerequisite** : A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite. Being a mythic character or monster is always a prerequisite for a mythic feat.

**Benefit** : What the feat enables the character ("you" in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

The bonus to save DCs provided by [Spell Focus](feats#_spell-focus) and Greater [Spell Focus](feats#_spell-focus) for that school increases by 1. You can expend one use of mythic power as part of casting a spell from your chosen school to force any of the spell's targets to roll their saving throws twice, taking the lower result.

**Special** : You can gain this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different non-mythic [Spell Focus](feats#_spell-focus) feat.

Spell Mastery (Mythic)

You're so familiar with certain spells you can prepare them with the greatest of ease.

**Prerequisite** : [Spell Mastery](feats#_spell-mastery).

**Benefit** : You can prepare spells you have selected with [Spell Mastery](feats#_spell-mastery) as a full-round action. You must spend the appropriate amount of time preparing other spells you have not mastered. As a full-round action, you can expend one use of mythic power to prepare all your spells that you have selected with [Spell Mastery](feats#_spell-mastery).

Spell Penetration (Mythic)

Your mythic power breaches your enemies' defenses.

**Prerequisite** : [Spell Penetration](feats#_spell-penetration).

**Benefit** : Add half your tier to caster level checks to overcome spell resistance. If you have Greater [Spell Penetration](feats#_spell-penetration), add your full tier instead.

Spellbreaker (Mythic)

You're a spellcaster's worst nightmare.

**Prerequisite** : [Spellbreaker](feats#_spellbreaker).

**Benefit** : Any non-mythic creature you threaten provokes an attack of opportunity from you whenever it uses a spell or spell-like ability, even when casting defensively or casting a quickened spell.

If a non-mythic creature within 30 feet of you uses a spell or spell-like ability, you can expend one use of mythic power to make a ranged attack against that creature as an attack of opportunity (even if the creature wouldn't normally provoke attacks of opportunity). You must have a ranged weapon in hand or have a free hand and the non-mythic [Quick Draw](feats#_quick-draw) feat to use this ability. You can use this ability against a mythic creature by expending two uses of mythic power.

Spirited Charge (Mythic)

Your mounted charge knocks the wind and wits from those foolish enough to stand against you.

**Prerequisite** : [Spirited Charge](feats#_spirited-charge).

**Benefit** : When you hit an opponent with a mounted charge, that opponent must succeed at a Fortitude saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Str modifier) or be staggered for a number of rounds equal to your tier. If you use a lance with this attack, increase the saving throw DC by 2. As a free action before you make the attack, you can expend one use of mythic power to daze your opponent on a failed saving throw instead of staggering it.

Spontaneous Metafocus (Mythic)

You apply metamagic to your spells with greater ease than do other spontaneous casters.

**Prerequisite** : [Spontaneous Metafocus](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_spontaneous-metafocus).

**Benefit** : You can change which spell your [Spontaneous Metafocus](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_spontaneous-metafocus) feat applies to each morning when you restore your expended spell slots. The spell it applies to can be of any level, but it must be a legal selection for the [Spontaneous Metafocus](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_spontaneous-metafocus) feat.

**Special** : You can gain this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different non-mythic [Spontaneous Metafocus](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_spontaneous-metafocus) feat.

Spring Attack (Mythic)

You move across the battlefield in a blur of whirling blades.

**Prerequisites** : [Spring Attack](feats#_spring-attack), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit** : When you use [Spring Attack](feats#_spring-attack), you don't need to move at least 10 feet before making the first attack. If you expend one use of mythic power when you start a [Spring Attack](feats#_spring-attack), the movement you make during the [Spring Attack](feats#_spring-attack) doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

Stealthy (Mythic)

Your grace and fluidity are beyond compare.

**Prerequisite** : [Stealthy](feats#_stealthy).

**Benefit** : The bonus on [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) and [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) skill checks from [Stealthy](feats#_stealthy) increases by 2. In addition, you can expend one use of mythic power to treat an [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) or [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) check as if you had rolled a natural 20. You must decide to use this ability before making the roll.

Strike Back (Mythic)

Your precise counterattacks degrade your foes' advantages in combat.

**Prerequisite** : [Strike Back](feats#_strike-back).

**Benefit** : When you make a melee attack as a readied action against a foe outside your melee reach, you can take a 5-foot step toward that foe. If you expend one use of mythic power, you can move your speed toward the foe instead. Neither of these counts toward the movement made during your turn.

Strong Comeback (Mythic)

You never make the same mistake twice.

**Prerequisite** : [Strong Comeback](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats#_strong-comeback).

**Benefit** : Whenever you're allowed to reroll an ability check, a skill check, or a saving throw, roll two dice and take the higher result, before adding the bonus from [Strong Comeback](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats#_strong-comeback).

Stunning Fist (Mythic)

With greater potency and frequency, your fists stun those who stand against you.

**Prerequisite** : [Stunning Fist](feats#_stunning-fist).

**Benefit** : The DC of your Stunning Fist increases by half your tier, and you can use Stunning Fist multiple times during the same round. As a free action, you can expend one use of your mythic power to use Stunning Fist without spending one of your daily uses of the feat.

Throw Anything (Mythic)

You're so skilled at throwing weapons that it hardly matters what you throw.

**Prerequisite** : [Throw Anything](feats#_throw-anything).

**Benefit** : You gain a +2 bonus on attack rolls and damage rolls made using an improvised thrown weapon or splash weapon. This bonus stacks with the bonus from the non-mythic [Throw Anything](feats#_throw-anything) feat. If you miss with a thrown splash weapon, it always lands adjacent to its target regardless of how many range increments it was thrown.

Titan Strike (Mythic)

Your fists can fell titanic foes.

**Prerequisite** : [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats#_improved-unarmed-strike) (mythic).

**Benefit** : Your unarmed strike deals damage as if you were one size category larger. You also gain a +1 bonus for each size category that your target is larger than you on the following: bull rush, drag, grapple, overrun, sunder, and trip combat maneuver checks and the DC of your Stunning Fist.

Toughness (Mythic)

You have legendary resilience and durability.

**Prerequisite** : [Toughness](feats#_toughness).

**Benefit** : [Toughness](feats#_toughness) provides you twice as many hit points. In addition, when you're below 0 hit points, you gain DR 10/epic. This DR stacks with any other DR/epic you might possess.

Trample (Mythic)

Your rearing mount can stomp foes into the ground, barely breaking stride.

**Prerequisite** : [Trample](feats#_trample).

**Benefit** : Your mount can make two hoof attacks against an opponent you knock down with an overrun, instead of one. You can expend one use of mythic power when you score a critical hit with one or more of those hoof attacks. When you do, the critical is automatically confirmed. If both scored critical hits, expending one use of mythic power automatically confirms both.

Tripping Staff (Mythic)

Your staff is valuable for attack and defensive balance.

**Prerequisite** : [Tripping Staff](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_tripping-staff).

**Benefit** : You add half your tier to CMD against trip maneuvers and on combat maneuver checks to trip with a quarterstaff. When you're wielding a quarterstaff and an opponent you threaten attempts to trip you and fails, it provokes an attack of opportunity from you. You must use your staff for this attack of opportunity.

Turn Undead (Mythic)

The power of your divine energy can not only cause undead to flee but also destroy them where they stand.

**Prerequisites** : [Turn Undead](feats#_turn-undead).

**Benefit** : When you use [Turn Undead](feats#_turn-undead), the range increases by 10 feet per tier, and non-mythic undead take a penalty on their saving throws equal to your tier.

You can expend one use of mythic power when using [Turn Undead](feats#_turn-undead) to destroy undead. Instead of fleeing, undead that fail their saves might be destroyed. You destroy 2d4 Hit Dice worth of undead per tier. Undead with the fewest HD are affected first; among undead with equal HD, those that are closest to the burst's point of origin are affected first. No undead of 9 or more HD can be affected, and HD that aren't sufficient to affect an undead are wasted.

Two-Fisted Drinker (Mythic)

You can pound down drinks with amazing verve.

**Prerequisite** : [Quick Draw](feats#_quick-draw).

**Benefit** : You can draw two potions or other beverages—mundane or magical—from a pouch, bandolier, or similar holder (but not from a backpack) as a move action. As a standard action, you can drink two potions or other beverages. You must have two free hands to use this feat.

Two-Weapon Defense (Mythic)

Your graceful flow between attack and defense makes you difficult to hit.

**Prerequisite** : [Two-Weapon Defense](feats#_two-weapon-defense).

**Benefit** : When using Two-Weapon Defense, you apply the highest enhancement bonus from your two weapons to the shield bonus granted by that feat.

Two-Weapon Fighting (Mythic)

With deft strikes, you gain an advantage over your foes beyond mere damage.

**Prerequisite** : [Two-Weapon Fighting](feats#_two-weapon-fighting).

**Benefit** : As an immediate action, you can expend one use of mythic power to negate the penalties on attack rolls for two-weapon fighting for a number of rounds equal to your tier.

Two-Weapon Rend (Mythic)

Your synchronized dual attacks are even more dangerous, and can leave lasting wounds.

**Prerequisite** : [Two-Weapon Rend](feats#_two-weapon-rend).

**Benefit** : The damage of your Two-Weapon Rend increases to 2d8 points plus twice your Strength modifier. You can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus on this damage equal to twice your tier.

Undead Master (Mythic)

Through your fearsome mythic nature, you have matchless power over the undead.

**Prerequisite** : [Undead Master](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_undead-master).

**Benefit** : When you cast _ [animate dead](spells/animateDead#_animate-dead) _or use the [Command Undead](feats#_command-undead) feat, add your tier to your caster level when determining the number of Hit Dice of undead you animate. This stacks with the increased caster level of [Undead Master](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_undead-master). When you cast _ [command undead](spells/commandUndead#_command-undead)_, your duration is tripled rather than doubled.

Unseat (Mythic)

You knock your opponents down from their mounts with frightening concussive force.

**Prerequisite** : [Unseat](feats#_unseat).

**Benefit** : When you successfully bull rush an opponent off his mount with Unseat, your opponent takes 1d6 points of falling damage per 2 tiers you possess. Items or abilities that reduce falling damage, such as a successful [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) check, can reduce the damage dealt by the impact.

Valiant Vault (Mythic)

Your mount can make heroic leaps.

**Prerequisites** : [Mounted Combat](feats#_mounted-combat), Ride-By Attack, [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) 5 ranks.

**Benefit** : Your mount is always considered to have a running start when using [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) to jump. You can expend one use of mythic power to grant your mount a +10 bonus on an [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) check, or a +20 bonus if the check is made to jump.

When making a mounted charge, you can guide your mount to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) check or your mount makes an [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the [Ride](skills/ride#_ride) skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a Ride-By Attack, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your jump exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your Ride-By Attack.

Vital Strike (Mythic)

You can strike your foes with incredible force.

**Prerequisite** : [Vital Strike](feats#_vital-strike).

**Benefit** : Whenever you use [Vital Strike](feats#_vital-strike), [Improved Vital Strike](feats#_improved-vital-strike), or Greater [Vital Strike](feats#_vital-strike), multiply the Strength bonus, magic bonus, and other bonuses that would normally be multiplied on a critical hit by the number of weapon damage dice you roll for that feat.

Extra damage from sources that wouldn't normally be multiplied on a critical hit isn't multiplied by this feat.

Voice of the Sibyl (Mythic)

You overpower weaker and more vulnerable minds with your voice alone.

**Prerequisite** : [Voice of the Sibyl](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_voice-of-the-sibyl).

**Benefit** : You gain a +1 bonus on all [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff), [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy), and [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (oratory) skill checks for every 3 tiers you possess. This bonus stacks with the bonus from [Voice of the Sibyl](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_voice-of-the-sibyl). If you have 10 or more ranks in at least two of these skills, gain a +2 bonus to the DC of any language-dependent spell you cast.

Warrior Priest (Mythic)

Your faith speeds you in battle and further strengthens your mind and confidence.

**Prerequisite** : [Warrior Priest](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_warrior-priest).

**Benefit** : You gain a bonus equal to half your tier both on initiative checks and on concentration checks to cast a spell or use a spell-like ability when casting defensively or while grappled. These bonuses stack with the bonuses from [Warrior Priest](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_warrior-priest).

Weapon Finesse (Mythic)

You're an expert with weapons that rely on your agility.

**Prerequisite** : [Weapon Finesse](feats#_weapon-finesse).

**Benefit** : When using [Weapon Finesse](feats#_weapon-finesse), you may also use your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on your damage rolls. If you carry a shield, its armor check penalty doesn't apply to either the attack rolls or the damage rolls.

Weapon Focus (Mythic)

You're a master of one type of weapon.

**Prerequisite** : [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus).

**Benefit** : Double the bonuses on your attack rolls from [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus) and Greater [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus). As a swift action, you can expend one use of mythic power to gain a bonus on attack rolls with your selected weapon equal to half your tier until the end of your turn.

**Special** : If you have taken non-mythic [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus) multiple times, you must choose which of those feats this enhances. You can take this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different non-mythic [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus) feat you have.

Weapon Specialization (Mythic)

The damage you deal with your chosen weapon is truly awesome to behold.

**Prerequisite** : [Weapon Specialization](feats#_weapon-specialization).

**Benefit** : When using your chosen weapon, you gain a bonus equal to half your tier on damage rolls. This stacks with the bonus from Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization.

**Special** : If you have taken non-mythic Weapon Specialization multiple times, you must choose which of those feats this enhances. You can take this feat multiple times. The effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a different non-mythic Weapon Specialization feat you have.

Witch Knife (Mythic)

Your witch knife is as much an extension of your body as it is an extension of your power.

**Prerequisite** : [Witch Knife](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_witch-knife).

**Benefit** : You can use your witch knife as an additional focus component for all your witch spells, not just your patron spells, adding 1 to their DC. This bonus stacks with the bonus to patron spells granted by [Witch Knife](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats#_witch-knife), granting your patron spells a total +2 bonus to their DC. Additionally, the hand holding the witch knife is still considered free for the purpose of casting spells and delivering touch attacks.
