# Mythic Feats

Mythic characters and monsters gain mythic feats as they gain tiers or ranks. These feats can be selected only as part of mythic advancement, not as part of a character's normal advancement or in place of any other bonus feat.

Most mythic feats require a non-mythic feat as a prerequisite. These mythic feats enhance the benefits of their prerequisite feats, making them truly awe-inspiring. If a character doesn't possess any of the necessary prerequisite feats when she gains a mythic feat, she can wait to select a mythic feat until the next time she gains a tier or level.

A value in a mythic feat based on a fraction of your tier (such as a +1 bonus for every 3 tiers you possess) always has a minimum of 1.

This section includes some non-mythic feats. These grant a character who hasn't had a moment of ascension a measure of mythic might, and remain relevant if that character later becomes mythic.

## Types of Feats

Many feats belong to a category that has special rules associated to it. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this section.

### Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.

### Mythic Feats

Only characters with mythic tiers or creatures with mythic ranks can take these feats. If a creature becomes non-mythic, it no longer gains the benefit of these feats, but it doesn't lose them permanently. If the creature becomes mythic again, it regains the use of all the mythic feats it once had.

Many mythic feats enhance non-mythic feats with the same name. When a creature has a mythic version of a feat, that feat is denoted with a superscript "M" in the feat line of its stat block.

### Mythic and Metamagic Feats

You'll notice there are no mythic metamagic feats. Because mythic versions of spells are, in a way, metamagic of their own, and there are many mythic abilities that empower such spellcasting, there is no need for mythic metamagic feats. If you desire more potent spellcasting power, select the Mythic Spell Lore feat multiple times.

There is also a non-mythic metamagic feat for casting spells as their mythic versions: Ascendant Spell.

Unseat (Mythic)

**Prerequisite** : [Unseat](feats.md#_unseat).

**Benefit** : When you successfully bull rush an opponent off his mount with Unseat, your opponent takes 1d6 points of falling damage per 2 tiers you possess.

You can expend one use of mythic power to grant your mount a +10 bonus on an [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check, or a +20 bonus if the check is made to jump.

When making a mounted charge, you can guide your mount to leap over a foe between your starting position and the target of your charge. You make a [Ride](skills/ride.md#_ride) check or your mount makes an [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check (whichever is lower) during the charge, using the rules for the leap task under the [Ride](skills/ride.md#_ride) skill. If the height you clear with that check exceeds the creature's height, you jump over it and continue your charge on the opposite side. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity. Alternatively, you can vault over your target while making a Ride-By Attack, allowing you to move over or through its space and continue moving on the opposite side of it. If your jump exceeds the target's height, you gain a +1 bonus on the attack roll for higher ground, and if any of your allies threatens the target, you treat the target as flanked for purposes of your Ride-By Attack.

This bonus stacks with the bonus from [Voice of the Sibyl](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.md#_voice-of-the-sibyl).

The damage you deal with your chosen weapon is truly awesome to behold.

**Prerequisite** : [Weapon Specialization](feats.md#_weapon-specialization).

**Benefit** : When using your chosen weapon, you gain a bonus equal to half your tier on damage rolls. This stacks with the bonus from Weapon Specialization and Greater Weapon Specialization.
