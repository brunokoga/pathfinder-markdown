Sands of Time

**Source** [_sands of time_](ultimateMagic/spells/sandsOfTime#_sands-of-time)

You age the target by two categories instead of one. The damage dealt to objects, constructs, and undead increases to 5d6 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +20).

**Augmented (8th)** : If you expend four uses of mythic power, the duration changes to instantaneous. If the target is a living creature, its age increases to venerable, regardless of its current age. A non-mythic creature receives no saving throw against this, but a mythic creature can attempt a Fortitude save against the spell's DC to reduce the duration to 10 minutes per level and the effect to two age categories instead of automatically changing to venerable.

If the target is an object, construct, or undead, it takes 30 points of damage per caster level. A mythic creature that succeeds at a Fortitude takes only half damage.
