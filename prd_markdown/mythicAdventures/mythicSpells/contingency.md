Contingency

**Source** [_contingency_](spells/contingency.md#_contingency)

You can cast this spell on yourself or another willing creature as if the spell had a range of touch. A companion spell placed on another creature must be a spell from you, not from the creature, and affects that creature when triggered. The target can have only one _ [contingency](spells/contingency.md#_contingency)_ spell upon it at a time unless it also knows _mythic contingency_. The number of companion spells you can have on yourself is equal to 1 + half your tier.

**Augmented (5th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the casting time changes to 1 full round plus the casting time of the companion spell, but the duration of _mythic contingency_ decreases to 1 hour per level or until discharged.
