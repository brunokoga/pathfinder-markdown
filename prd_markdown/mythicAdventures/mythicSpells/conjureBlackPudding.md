Conjure Black Pudding

**Source** [_conjure black pudding_](ultimateMagic/spells/conjureBlackPudding.md#_conjure-black-pudding)

The black pudding has fast healing equal to your tier, as do any puddings that [split](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_split) off from it. The black puddings from this spell never attack you, though they're otherwise uncontrolled and might attack your allies if there are no other obvious opponents.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the pudding gains the savage mythic template (see page 224). Puddings that split off from the giant pudding don't gain the template.
