Disfiguring Touch

**Source** [_disfiguring touch_](ultimateMagic/spells/disfiguringTouch#_disfiguring-touch-)

The target takes two different penalties (chosen from the same list) instead of one.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target also gains the fatigued condition because of its painful disfigurement. If this fatigue is negated without removing the curse, it returns after 1 hour.
