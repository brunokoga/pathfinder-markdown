Nightmare

**Source** [_nightmare_](spells/nightmare#_nightmare)

The spell's damage increases to 4d6 points of damage, and the target is also shaken for 24 hours.

**Augmented (6th)** : You can deliver a mind-affecting spell through a _mythic nightmare_. The maximum level of the delivered spell is equal to half your tier, and you must expend one use of mythic power for each spell level of the imbued spell in addition to the one use needed to cast _mythic nightmare_. You choose whether the delivered spell affects the creature immediately or when it awakens. The delivered spell affects only the target, even if it normally affects multiple creatures or an area.
