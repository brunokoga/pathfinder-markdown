Damnation Stride

**Source** [_damnation stride_](advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/tieflings.md#_damnation-stride)

The burst of fire created reeks of sulfur and brimstone and also acts like _ [stinking cloud](spells/stinkingCloud.md#_stinking-cloud)_ (with the same duration as that spell and a separate Fortitude save).

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you bring one unwilling adjacent creature with you. You may bring additional creatures, but each must be adjacent to you and each requires you to expend one additional use of mythic power. These creatures must first attempt a saving throw against the burst of flame and _ [stinking cloud](spells/stinkingCloud.md#_stinking-cloud)_, then can attempt a Will saving throw to resist being teleported with you.
