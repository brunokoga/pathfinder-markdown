Feather Fall

**Source** [_feather fall_](spells/featherFall#_feather-fall)

The spell affects one additional target per level. The targets don't have to be within 20 feet of each other.

**Augmented (4th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell absorbs the targets' velocity and transforms it into a concussive blast. Targets fall at the normal rate (not slowed) but land safely. When a target lands, it creates a 10-foot-radius burst of force that deals 1d6 points of damage per caster level (maximum 5d6, Reflex half, DC equal to the DC of _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall#_feather-fall)_). The targets of this spell are unaffected by these concussive blasts.
