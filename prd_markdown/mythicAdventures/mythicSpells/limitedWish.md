Limited Wish

**Source** [_limited wish_](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)

When using _mythic limited wish_ to duplicate another spell, you can duplicate a mythic spell you know (if you're a spontaneous caster) or have prepared (if you're a caster who prepares spells). If you don't know or haven't prepared the mythic spell, you can expend a second use of mythic power duplicate the mythic version of the desired spell.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast a silent, stilled _mythic limited wish_, even if you're helpless or couldn't otherwise take actions (but not unconscious).
