Resist Energy

**Source** [_resist energy_](spells/resistEnergy.md#_resist-energy)

The target gains a +4 bonus on saves against effects that deal damage of the selected energy type. Once each round as a free action, the target can choose one adjacent ally to gain energy resistance 5 against the chosen energy type for 1 round. This increases to energy resistance 10 at caster level 7 and energy resistance 15 at caster level 11.
