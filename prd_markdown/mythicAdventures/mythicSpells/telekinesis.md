Telekinesis

**Source** [_telekinesis_](spells/telekinesis#_telekinesis)

The duration of this spell changes to 1 round per level. You may spend a move action to use the sustained force or combat maneuver effects of the spell.

When using sustained force, you can move a number of objects up to your tier. These must be in the same square and together must weigh no more than the weight limit of the spell.

Using the violent thrust effect ends the spell, but the weight restriction increases to 50 pounds per caster level (maximum 750 pounds).
