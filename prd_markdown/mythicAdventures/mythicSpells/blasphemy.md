Blasphemy

**Source** [_blasphemy_](spells/blasphemy#_blasphemy)

When determining the spell's effect on non-mythic creatures, add your tier to your caster level. Nonevil creatures that fail the save take a –4 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws, and their spell resistance decreases by 5 for as long as the spell's other effects last.
