Ear-Piercing Scream

**Source** [_ear-piercing scream_](ultimateMagic/spells/earPiercingScream#_ear-piercing-scream)

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d8) and the duration that creatures in the area are dazed is a number of rounds equal to your tier.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell affects a 30-foot cone rather than a single target.
