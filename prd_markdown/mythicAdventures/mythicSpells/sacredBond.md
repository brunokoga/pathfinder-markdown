Sacred Bond

**Source** [_sacred bond_](advanced/spells/sacredBond.md#_sacred-bond)

The range at which you and the target can cast conjuration (healing) spells on each other increases to medium (100 feet + 10 feet per caster level). When you or the target uses the _sacred bond_ to cast a healing spell on the other, the caster also heals a number of hit points equal to the minimum amount the spell can heal.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, casting a healing spell through the link heals the caster the normal amount instead of the minimum amount.

You and the target can use the link to heal each other with targeted healing abilities such as lay on hands. Unlike with healing spells, a character using a healing ability in this way doesn't heal herself.
