Silence

This spell also applies to telepathy, cutting off any mental communication within the area. At the time of casting, you can choose to be immune to your own _mythic silence_ effect and can designate up to one creature per tier to also gain this immunity. Creatures immune to the _mythic silence_ are subject to sonic effects as normal.
