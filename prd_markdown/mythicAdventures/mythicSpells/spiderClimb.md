Spider Climb

**Source** [_spider climb_](spells/spiderClimb#_spider-climb)

The target gains a climb speed equal to its base land speed or 30 feet, whichever is higher. The target can take the run action while climbing and needs only one hand free to climb.

The target can move freely across spider webs (including giant spider webs), _ [web](spells/web#_web)_ spells, and similar adhesives of 2nd level or less (including tanglefoot bags) as if it were using _ [freedom of movement](spells/freedomOfMovement#_freedom-of-movement)_.
