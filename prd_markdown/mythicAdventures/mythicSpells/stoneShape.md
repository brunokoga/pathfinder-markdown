Stone Shape

**Source** [_stone shape_](spells/stoneShape#_stone-shape)

The duration changes to 1 round/level and instantaneous (see text). Each round after the round you cast the spell, you can spend a standard action to shape up to 5 additional cubic feet of stone you touch. Shaped stone has an instantaneous duration (meaning it does not revert to its previous form when the spell ends).
