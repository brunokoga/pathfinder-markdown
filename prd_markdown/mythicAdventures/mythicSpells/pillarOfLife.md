The damage dealt to undead increases to 1d8 points of damage per caster level (maximum 10d8), or 2d6 points of damage per caster level for undead vulnerable to bright light (maximum 20d6). If a dead creature is brought into the pillar's square and that creature could be revived by _ [breath of life](spells/breathOfLife#_breath-of-life)_, the _pillar of life_ ends and the creature returns to life as per _breath of life_.
