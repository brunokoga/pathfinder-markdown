Blade Barrier

**Source** [_blade barrier_](spells/bladeBarrier#_blade-barrier)

You may cast this spell as an immediate action. The barrier's damage increases to 1d8 per caster level (maximum 20d8).

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend a move action to move the barrier up to 10 feet in any direction. The shape (flat or ring) and orientation (vertical or horizontal) of the wall must remain the same. If you move the barrier through a creature's space, it can attempt a saving throw to avoid the wall, as if you had created it where the creature is.
