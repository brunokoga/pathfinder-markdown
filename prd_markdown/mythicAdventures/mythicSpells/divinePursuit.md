The speed of the movement form provided by the spell increases by 30 feet. This adjustment is treated as an enhancement bonus. You gain a bonus on [Perception](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception) and [Survival](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival) skill checks attempted against the selected creature. This is a sacred bonus if you're good or a profane bonus if you're evil; if you're neutral, choose either the sacred or profane bonus.
