Sanctify Armor

**Source** [_sanctify armor_](advanced/spells/sanctifyArmor#_sanctify-armor)

You gain DR 5/evil while wearing the target armor. While you're using your judgment or smite ability, this improves to DR 10/evil.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use judgment or smite, add half your tier to your AC as a sacred bonus.
