Blink

**Source** [_blink_](spells/blink.md#_blink)

You may spend a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn (you automatically resume blinking at the end of your turn).

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can spend either a swift action or a move action to remain corporeal or incorporeal until the end of your turn.
