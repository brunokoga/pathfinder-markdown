The range increases to 30 feet. Add half your tier to the spell's Hit Dice categories to determine its effects on creatures. (At 3rd tier a creature with 3 or fewer HD is unconscious, blinded, and stunned; one with 4 or 5 HD is blinded and stunned, and one with 6 or more HD is stunned.) Creatures that succeed at their saves are dazzled for 1 minute.
