The duration increases to concentration + 1 round per caster level, and the effect increases to a visual figment that can't extend beyond eight 10-foot cubes + 1 10-foot cube per caster level.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the duration changes to concentration + 1 minute per caster level and the effect changes to a visual figment no larger than a 50-foot emanation. An augmented _mythic silent image_ can't move.
