Beast Shape (all)

**Source** [_beast shape_](spells/beastShape)

Each _mythic beast shape_ spell must be learned individually, and you must know the respective non-mythic _beast shape_ spell to learn its mythic version. You don't have to learn them in order and are not required to know a lower-level _mythic beast shape_ spell before you learn a higher-level one (for example, you can learn _mythic beast shape II _if you know _ [beast shape II](spells/beastShape#_beast-shape-ii)_, even if you don't know _mythic beast shape I_). Each _mythic beast shape_ spell adds the following benefits to its respective non-mythic version.

The spell's bonuses to ability scores increase by 2, the natural armor bonus increases by 1, and the ability score penalties decrease by 2 (minimum penalty of 0). Choose one natural attack type the animal form has, such as bite or claws. The critical multiplier for this attack type increases by 1 (maximum ×4).

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the ability score bonuses increase by an additional 2. During each casting of the spell, a number of times equal to your tier, you can act as if you had the [Natural Spell](feats#_natural-spell) feat for 1 round. For example, if you're 2nd tier, you can use the [Natural Spell](feats#_natural-spell) feat for 2 rounds per casting of _mythic beast shape_.
