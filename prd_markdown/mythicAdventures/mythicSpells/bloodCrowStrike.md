Unarmed strikes attempted with this spell are treated as if you had the [Improved Critical](/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_improved-critical) (unarmed strike) feat. Use your tier plus your monk level (if any) when determining your unarmed strike damage for this spell. Fire damage from this spell bypasses fire resistance.
