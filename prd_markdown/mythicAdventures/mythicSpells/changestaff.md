Changestaff

**Source** [_changestaff_](spells/changestaff.md#_changestaff)

The treant-like creature created with this spell is considered a mythic creature, and it gains DR 10/epic and slashing instead of gaining DR 10/slashing.

**Augmented (7th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the creature gains the savage mythic template.
