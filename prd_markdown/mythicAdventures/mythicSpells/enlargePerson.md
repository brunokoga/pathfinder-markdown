Enlarge Person

**Source** [_enlarge person_](spells/enlargePerson.md#_enlarge-person)

You can increase the target's size by up to two size categories, to a maximum of Huge. If the target grows two sizes, its weight increases by a factor of 25, it gains a +4 size bonus to Strength, and takes a –4 size penalty to Dexterity and a –2 penalty on attack rolls and to AC because of its increased size. A Medium humanoid creature whose size increases to Huge has a space of 15 feet and a natural reach of 10 feet. _Mythic enlarge person_ counters and dispels [_mythic reduce person_](mythicAdventures/mythicSpells/reducePerson.md).
