Faerie Fire

**Source** [_faerie fire_](spells/faerieFire#_faerie-fire)

Outlined creatures are dazzled. The spell outlines figment illusions in the burst, revealing them as such. This effect applies only to figments with a caster level equal to or less than your tier.

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, each creature in the burst must succeed at a Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round.
