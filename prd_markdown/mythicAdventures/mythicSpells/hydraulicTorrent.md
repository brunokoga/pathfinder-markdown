The water is boiling hot or freezing cold, dealing 1d6 points of fire or cold damage per 2 caster levels. Add your tier to your CMB for the spell and on the Strength check to destroy immovable targets.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can extinguish magical fires as if using a targeted _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_. Freezing cold water hardens into ice on the ground, lasting as long as prevailing conditions allow. Boiling hot water turns into steam, creating an area of concealing mist (equivalent to _ [obscuring mist](spells/obscuringMist#_obscuring-mist)_) that fills the affected squares and all squares adjacent to the line of the spell.
