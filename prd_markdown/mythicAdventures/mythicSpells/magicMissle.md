Magic Missile

**Source** [_magic missile_](spells/magicMissile.md#_magic-missile)

The damage dealt by each missile increases to 2d4+1. The missiles bypass the _ [shield](spells/shield.md#_shield)_ spell and similar effects that block the non-mythic version of this spell.

**Augmented (4th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell creates double the normal number of missiles (affecting up to 10 creatures), its range increases to line of sight, and it bypasses the targets' spell resistance and spell immunity.
