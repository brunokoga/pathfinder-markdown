Dust of Twilight

**Source** [_dust of twilight_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/spells/dustOfTwilight.html#_dust-of-twilight)

A creature that fails its Fortitude save against the spell must also succeed at a Will save at the same DC or fall asleep (as the _ [sleep](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/sleep.html#_sleep)_ spell). Creatures that succeed at their saves are merely drowsy (as the _ [lullaby](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/lullaby.html#_lullaby)_ spell).

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, add half your tier to the level of light spells _mythic dust of twilight _dispels.
