Hold Portal

**Source** [_hold portal_](spells/holdPortal.md#_hold-portal)

The target portal can be as large as 30 square feet per caster level. A creature attempting to force open the portal must first succeed at a Will save against the spell's DC. This is a mind-affecting effect. Failure means the creature can't open the door while the spell is in effect.
