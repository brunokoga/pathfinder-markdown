Flesh to Stone

**Source** [_flesh to stone_](spells/fleshToStone#_flesh-to-stone)

A creature that succeeds at its saving throw is partially petrified, becoming slowed (as the _ [slow](spells/slow#_slow)_ spell) for a number of rounds equal to your tier. The creature can end this effect early by spending a full-round action breaking away its own petrified flesh, dealing 5d10 points of damage to itself. Any effect that removes or reverses petrification negates this partial petrification and the _ [slow](spells/slow#_slow)_ effect.

The spell can affect objects and undead, as long as the target is primarily made of flesh or bone, such as a corpse or zombie. The spell doesn't affect the target's gear. If cast on a creature with equipment, the creature transforms into stone but its gear doesn't.

**Augmented (9th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, any Large or smaller creature fully petrified by the spell immediately animates and follows your commands, as if you had cast _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.
