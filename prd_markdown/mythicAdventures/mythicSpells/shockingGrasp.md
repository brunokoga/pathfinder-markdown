Shocking Grasp

**Source** [_shocking grasp_](spells/shockingGrasp.md#_shocking-grasp)

The spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 5d8). If the target is wearing metal armor or is made of metal, you may attempt a free grapple combat maneuver against the target.

Alternatively, if the target is carrying a metal weapon, you may attempt a free disarm combat maneuver against that weapon. This free combat maneuver doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power and the free grapple or disarm combat maneuver is successful, the target is staggered until your next turn. This is an electricity effect.
