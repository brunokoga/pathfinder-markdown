Burning Gaze

**Source** [_burning gaze_](advanced/spells/burningGaze.md#_burning-gaze)

You may focus your burning [gaze](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_gaze) on a creature or object as a move action instead of as a standard action. The target takes 1d8 points of fire damage for failing its save and for each round it's on fire.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, once during the spell's duration you can, as a full-round action, direct your burning gaze at up to one creature per caster level.
