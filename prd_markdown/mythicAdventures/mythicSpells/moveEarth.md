Move Earth

**Source** [_move earth_](spells/moveEarth#_move-earth)

This spell can move earth much more quickly, with each full round of casting allowing you to reshape a 25-foot-square area up to 10 feet deep. All creatures on or under the ground within that area are knocked prone and moved to the closest square outside the area being shaped. A successful Reflex save prevents a creature from being knocked prone, but it's still moved.
