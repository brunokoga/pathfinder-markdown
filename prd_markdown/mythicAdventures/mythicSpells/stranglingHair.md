Strangling Hair

**Source** [_strangling hair_](ultimateMagic/spells/stranglingHair.md#_strangling-hair)

You may use your hair to attempt dirty trick, disarm, steal, or trip combat maneuvers instead of grapple combat maneuvers. Add your tier to combat maneuver checks attempted with your hair and to your hair's damage rolls made as part of a grapple.
