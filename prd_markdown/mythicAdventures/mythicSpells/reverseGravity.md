Reverse Gravity

**Source** [_reverse gravity_](spells/reverseGravity.md#_reverse-gravity)

Creatures in the area or that enter the area must succeed at a Fortitude save or be nauseated.

**Augmented (8th)** : If you expend three uses of mythic power, once per round as a move action you may select one secured creature (one that succeeded at its Reflex save) or attached object (such as a tree or cottage) and force it to attempt a Fortitude save against the spell. The selected creature or object can weigh no more than 100 pounds per caster level. If it fails the save, it's pulled free and falls upward.
