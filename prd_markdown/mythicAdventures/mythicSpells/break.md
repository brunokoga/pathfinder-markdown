Break

**Source** [_break_](advanced/spells/break.md#_break-)

You can target up to 1 Medium or smaller object per caster level.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, target objects gain the broken condition on a successful save and are destroyed on a failed save. This doesn't affect mythic objects or objects held or carried by mythic creatures.
