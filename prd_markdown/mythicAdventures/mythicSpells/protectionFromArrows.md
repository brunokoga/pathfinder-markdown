Protection from Arrows

**Source** [_protection from arrows_](spells/protectionFromArrows.md#_protection-from-arrows)

The damage reduction increases to 15/magic. The maximum damage prevented by the spell increases to 15 points per caster level (maximum 150 points). If the spell prevents all damage from a ranged weapon attack, it turns the projectile or weapon back on the attacker, using the same attack roll result. If the attacker is also protected by _mythic protection from arrows_ and its spell completely prevents the damage from the rebounded attack, the weapon or projectile is destroyed.
