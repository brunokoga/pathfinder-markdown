Sending

**Source** [_sending_](spells/sending.md#_sending)

You can contact a number of additional creatures equal to your tier. Each creature must receive the same message, and can communicate back only to you.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can send the message to unfamiliar creatures (using the same number of creatures as non-augmented _mythic sending_). You must either describe the intended recipients in general or specific terms (such as "orcs," "the queen of this country," or "left-handed half-elven males") or specify restrictions such as range, creature type, and alignment (such as "all good-aligned humanoids in the castle on the hill"). If a greater number of creatures meet your description than the maximum number you can send to, the closest ones to you receive the message.
