Cup of Dust

On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist dehydration as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires drinking, such as potions and elixirs (though these are still used up when the target drinks them).
