Boiling Blood

**Source** [_boiling blood_](ultimateMagic/spells/boilingBlood.md#_boiling-blood)

A target that fails its save takes 1d3 points of fire damage per round. If a target has the [orc](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_orc-subtype) subtype, it also gains fire resistance 5.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can affect allies as though they had the orc subtype.
