Orb of the Void

**Source** [_orb of the void_](ultimateMagic/spells/orbOfTheVoid.md#_orb-of-the-void)

A creature that fails its save against the orb gains 2 negative levels rather than 1. A successful Fortitude save reduces this to 1 negative level.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the orb doesn't automatically stop when in enters a space with a living creature, but the saving throw DC decreases by 2 for each creature after the first it affects each round.

An individual creature can be affected by the _orb of the void_ only once per round, even if the orb moves through its space more than once.
