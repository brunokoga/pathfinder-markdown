True Form

**Source** [_true form_](advanced/spells/trueForm.md#_true-form)

The spell's target changes to up to one creature per 2 caster levels. If a target is a creature that has the ability to [change shape](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_change-shape) between a specific set of forms (such as a barghest or lycanthrope), you may choose which form the creature takes. To force such a creature into a form, you must have either seen it in that form or succeeded at an appropriate [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) check to know the creature has the ability to take that form.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend three uses of mythic power, the spell creates an area affecting all shapechanging creatures. The range changes to 30 feet and the spell affects all creatures in a 30-foot radius around you. Each creature must attempt a saving throw against the spell every round it remains in the area.
