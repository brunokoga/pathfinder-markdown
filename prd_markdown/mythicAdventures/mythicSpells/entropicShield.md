Entropic Shield

**Source** [_entropic shield_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/entropicShield.html#_entropic-shield)

When a ranged attack misses because of this spell, there is a 50% chance that the attack is redirected back at the attacker rather than just being deflected harmlessly. The attack uses the same result as the attack roll the attacker made against you.
