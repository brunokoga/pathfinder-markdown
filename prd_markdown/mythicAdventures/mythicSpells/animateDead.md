Animate Dead

**Source** [_animate dead_](spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)

Add your tier to your caster level when determining how many Hit Dice of undead you can animate with a single casting of this spell. This doesn't increase the total number of Hit Dice worth of undead you can control. By expending a second use of mythic power, you can ignore the spell's material component cost.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, any skeletons or zombies you create gain either the agile or savage mythic template. This template lasts for a number of days equal to your tier.

Alternatively, if you're 8th tier and expend 10 uses of mythic power, any skeletons you create permanently gain the mythic skeleton template.
