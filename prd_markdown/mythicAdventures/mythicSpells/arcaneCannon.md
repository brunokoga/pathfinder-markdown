Arcane Cannon

**Source** [_arcane cannon_](ultimateCombat/spells/arcaneCannon.md#_arcane-cannon)

The cannon deals 6d10 points of damage on a successful hit. Add your tier to the cannon's hardness and your tier Ã— 5 to its hit points. Its _ [conductive](advanced/magicItems/weapons.md#_conductive)_ property can channel any spell with a range of touch (you have to expend only one spell for this, not two). You may cast a spell with an energy descriptor on the cannon. If you do, for a number of rounds equal to the spell's level, half the cannon's damage is untyped damage and the other half is energy damage of the spell's type. Casting a spell with a different energy descriptor onto the cannon replaces its current energy type with that of the new spell.
