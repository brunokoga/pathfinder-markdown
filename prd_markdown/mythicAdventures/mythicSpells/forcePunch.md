Force Punch

**Source** [_force punch_](ultimateMagic/spells/forcePunch.md#_force-punch)

The damage dealt increases to 1d6 points of force damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). If moving the target would push it into another creature's space and it has at least 10 feet of distance remaining, you can attempt to overrun the other creature, adding your tier on the combat maneuver check. For each creature you overrun with the target, reduce the distance the target moves by 5 feet. If moving the target would push it into a solid obstacle (such as a wall or tree), the target takes damage as if it had fallen the distance pushed.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can cast this spell as a ranged touch attack with a range of close (25 feet + 5 feet per 2 caster levels), and the target is treated as two size categories smaller for the purpose of determining the total distance pushed.
