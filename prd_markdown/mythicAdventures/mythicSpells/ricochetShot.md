Ricochet Shot

**Source** [_ricochet shot_](ultimateCombat/spells/ricochetShot.md#_ricochet-shot)

If the attack hits the secondary target, the wielder can select a tertiary target within 20 feet of the secondary target. This functions like a ricochet off the primary target. The tertiary target must be a different creature than the primary target.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the secondary and tertiary attacks gain the enhancement bonus and magic qualities of the attack against the primary target.
