Wall of Thorns

**Source** [_wall of thorns_](spells/wallOfThorns#_wall-of-thorns)

The damage dealt increases to 30 minus the creature's AC. Any creature adjacent to the wall is automatically grappled by it. Any creature that begins its turn grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of damage. Half of this damage is bludgeoning, and the other half is piercing. For the purpose of escaping this grapple, the wall's CMD is 10 + your caster level + your tier.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the wall automatically grapples creatures other than you within 10 feet. Any creature grappled by the wall takes 2d6 points of bleed damage. If a creature doesn't escape the wall's grapple, on its next turn the wall automatically pins it.
