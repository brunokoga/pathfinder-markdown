Gust of Wind

**Source** [_gust of wind_](spells/gustOfWind.md#_gust-of-wind)

The force of the wind increases to windstorm (approximately 70 mph). All effects described in the spell affect creatures one size larger. Ranged attacks can't be attempted in the area of the spell. The wind automatically blows out unprotected flames and has a 75% chance of blowing out protected flames.

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell lasts for 1 additional round and the range increases by 30 feet. As a swift action at the start of your turn, you can expend another use of mythic power to extend the duration by 1 round and the range by another 30 feet.
