Guards and Wards

**Source** [_guards and wards_](spells/guardsAndWards.md#_guards-and-wards)

You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental _ [alarm](spells/alarm.md#_alarm)_ spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using _ [arcane eye](spells/arcaneEye.md#_arcane-eye)_. When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (_ [dancing lights](spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights)_ and so on) instead of one.

**Augmented (3rd)** : You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.
