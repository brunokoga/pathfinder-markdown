Guards and Wards

**Source** [_guards and wards_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/guardsAndWards.html#_guards-and-wards)

You are alerted whenever any creature enters the warded area as if by a mental _ [alarm](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/alarm.html#_alarm)_ spell as long as you're on the same plane as the warded area. At will, you can concentrate to observe the warded area as if using _ [arcane eye](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/arcaneEye.html#_arcane-eye)_. When you start concentrating, the sensor always appears at a point you designate when you cast the spell. You can place two of the five effects listed in the spell (_ [dancing lights](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dancingLights.html#_dancing-lights)_ and so on) instead of one.

**Augmented (3rd)** : You can place the following effects anywhere within the warded area by expending one additional use of mythic power per effect.
