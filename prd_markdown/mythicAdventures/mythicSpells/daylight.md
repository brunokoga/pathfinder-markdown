The illumination in the additional 60 foot radius increases to at least normal light regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Creatures that take penalties in bright light double those penalties while in the area of bright light produced by this spell. All other creatures in the area of bright light gain a +2 circumstance bonus on [Perception](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception) checks and saves to resist [fear](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_fear).
