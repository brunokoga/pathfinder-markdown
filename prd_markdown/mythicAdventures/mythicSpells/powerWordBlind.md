Power Word Blind

**Source** [_power word blind_](spells/powerWordBlind.md#_power-word-blind)

Treat the target's current hit point total as though it were lowered by 5 times your tier. For example, a 3rd-tier archmage casting _mythic power word blind_ would affect a creature with 60 hp as though it had 45 hp, and the spell would permanently blind the target.

You can target a creature with more hit points than this spell could normally affect, causing it to treat all opponents as though they had concealment (20% miss chance) for 1d4 rounds.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the magic of the word lingers around the target. Until the beginning of your next turn, if the target's hit points are reduced enough to put it in a lower category for the spell's effects, the spell affects the creature according to its new hit point total. For example, a creature in the 101â€“200 hp category reduced to 80 hp immediately becomes blinded for 1d4+1 minutes instead of 1d4+1 rounds. The spell's effects don't diminish if the target regains hit points.
