Confusion

**Source** [_confusion_](spells/confusion.md#_confusion)

Roll on the table below instead of the non-mythic version at the start of each subject's turn to see what it does in that round.

| d% | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| 01–25 | Subject acts normally, but takes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls, skill checks, and ability checks until its next turn. |
| 26–50 | Subject does nothing but babble incoherently, and takes a –4 penalty to AC until its next turn. |
| 51–75 | Subject deals 2d8 points of damage + Str modifier to self with item in hand. |
| 76–100 | Subject attacks nearest ally (for this purpose, a familiar counts as an ally). |

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power when casting the spell, you force one affected creature per round to roll on the table twice and take the higher result.
