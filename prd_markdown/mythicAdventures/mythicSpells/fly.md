Fly

**Source** [_fly_](spells/fly.md)

The fly speed changes to 120 feet (or 80 feet if the target is wearing medium or heavy armor, or carrying a medium or heavy load) with perfect maneuverability. When the duration expires, the target is protected by _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_ for a number of rounds equal to your caster level.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target adds your tier on Reflex saves and as a dodge bonus to AC. It gains these bonuses only while flying.
