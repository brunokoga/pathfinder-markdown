Heroism

**Source** [_heroism_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/heroism.html#_heroism)

The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks, attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against [fear](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_fear) effects.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round when taking a full attack action (as if using a _ [haste](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/haste.html#_haste)_ spell). The target can use this additional attack ability a number of times equal to your tier.
