Heroism

**Source** [_heroism_](spells/heroism#_heroism)

The morale bonus increases to +4 and applies on all checks, attack rolls, saves, and weapon damage rolls. Allies adjacent to the target gain a +4 morale bonus on saves against [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_fear) effects.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can attempt one additional attack per round when taking a full attack action (as if using a _ [haste](spells/haste#_haste)_ spell). The target can use this additional attack ability a number of times equal to your tier.
