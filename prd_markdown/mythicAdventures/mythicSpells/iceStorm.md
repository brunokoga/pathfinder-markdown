Ice Storm

**Source** [_ice storm_](spells/iceStorm.md#_ice-storm)

The bludgeoning damage increases to 4d8 points of damage and the cold damage increases to 3d6 points of damage. The ground in the area is covered in ice and hailstones, acting as though a _ [grease](spells/grease.md#_grease)_ spell were cast on it. Dealing 5 or more points of fire damage to a square melts the ice and hail, negating the _ [grease](spells/grease.md#_grease)_ effect.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, one creature in the area is paralyzed (as if by _ [hold person](spells/holdPerson.md#_hold-person)_) and gains vulnerability to fire as long as it's paralyzed.
