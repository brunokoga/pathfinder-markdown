Scorching Ash Form

**Source** [_scorching ash form_](advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/ifrits#_scorching-ash-form)

The damage dealt increases to 3d6 points of fire damage. This otherwise makes the same changes as [_mythic gaseous form_](/pathfinderRPG/mythicAdventures/mythicSpells/gaseousForm).

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of _scorching ash form_ as a move action.
