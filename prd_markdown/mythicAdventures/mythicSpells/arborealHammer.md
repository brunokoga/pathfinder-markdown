Arboreal Hammer

**Source** [_arboreal hammer_](ultimateMagic/spells/arborealHammer.md#_arboreal-hammer)

You animate two branches instead of one, allowing the tree to attack twice per round. Add your tier to your caster level when determining the tree's Strength score. A creature struck by both slam attacks in the same round must succeed at a Fortitude save against the spell's DC or be staggered for 1 round.

**Augmented (7th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the tree attempts three slam attacks per round and its slams bypass all damage reduction. A creature struck by all three slam attacks in the same round is stunned for 1 round and staggered for 1d4 rounds after the stun ends. A successful Fortitude save negates the stun and reduces the duration of being staggered by half.
