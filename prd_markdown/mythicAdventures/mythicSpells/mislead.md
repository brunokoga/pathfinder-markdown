Mislead

**Source** [_mislead_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/mislead.html#_mislead)

You create one illusory double per 5 caster levels, each of which appears in your square or in an unoccupied square adjacent to yours. When you cast the spell, you can give each of these doubles a simple programmed task as a telepathic command, such a "walk south," "beg for mercy," or "follow that troll."

You can change or modify a single illusory double's programmed task by spending a swift, move, or standard action; this requires concentration.

**Augmented (4th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, this spell also grants you the benefits of augmented [_mythic invisibility_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/mythicAdventures/mythicSpells/invisibility.html) instead of _ [greater invisibility](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility-greater)_.
