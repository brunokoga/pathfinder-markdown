True Strike

**Source** [_true strike_](spells/trueStrike#_true-strike)

The affected attack bypasses all [damage reduction](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_damage-reduction).

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you gain a +10 insight bonus on your second attack that round and a +5 insight bonus on your third attack that round. The second and third attacks can be on your turn or on another creature's turn before your next turn (such as when you attempt an attack of opportunity).
