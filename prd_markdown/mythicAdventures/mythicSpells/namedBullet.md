Named Bullet

**Source** [_named bullet_](ultimateCombat/spells/namedBullet#_named-bullet)

Increase the critical multiplier of the target weapon by 1 (maximum ×4).

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target ammunition or weapon returns to the creature that shot or threw it just before that creature's next turn (similar to a _ [returning](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-returning)_ weapon). The spell isn't discharged until the target is used to attempt a second attack against the named creature. Ammunition that hits is destroyed and doesn't return.
