Darkness

**Source** [_darkness_](spells/darkness.md#_darkness)

The illumination level in the area drops to darkness regardless of the existing lighting conditions. Non-mythic spells and effects can't increase the light level in the area. Creatures with darkvision and the power to [see in darkness](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_see-in-darkness) have difficulty seeing through this darkness, and can see as well as a human can in dim light. Creatures in the area of darkness take a â€“2 penalty on saves against [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear).
