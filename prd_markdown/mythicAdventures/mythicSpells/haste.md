Haste

**Source** [_haste_](spells/haste.md#_haste)

Affected creatures gain an additional move action each round. The movement speed increase changes to 50 feet, to a maximum of three times the creature's normal speed for that movement type.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the movement speed increase changes to 70 feet, with no limit based on the creature's normal speed. If an affected creature moves at least 30 feet on its turn, it can travel across liquid as if the liquid were solid. If the liquid deals damage on contact, the creature takes only half damage from moving across it.
