The bonuses to AC and on saves increase to +4. Any [evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_evil-subtype) creature attempting to possess or exercise mental control over the target must attempt a Will save against this spell. If it fails, the creature takes 1d6 points of damage per 2 caster levels (maximum 5d6) from mental feedback. An evil creature that uses spell resistance to bypass the spell's protection against contact must successfully save or take this damage once each round it attacks the protected target.
