Gaseous Form

**Source** [_gaseous form_](spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)

The [damage reduction](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_damage-reduction) changes to DR 10/epic and magic, and the fly speed increases to 30 feet. The target can expand itself as a free action, filling an area equal to double its normal space and height (a Medium creature fills a 10-foot-by-10-foot space to a height of about 10 feet) and blocking vision as _ [obscuring mist](spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)_. Returning from expanded to normal size is also a free action.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the target can shift into or out of gaseous form as a move action.
