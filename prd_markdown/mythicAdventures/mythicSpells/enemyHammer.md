Enemy Hammer

**Source** [_enemy hammer_](advanced/spells/enemyHammer.md#_enemy-hammer-)

The target becomes entangled whether or not it succeeds at its saving throw. When using the target as a weapon, add half your tier to your attack roll, and add your tier to the damage roll.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, when you use the target to hit a creature, you can attempt a free bull rush combat maneuver against that creature. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your attack bonus for _mythic enemy hammer_, except you add your tier instead of half your tier.
