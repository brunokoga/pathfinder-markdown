Plane Shift

**Source** [_plane shift_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift)

If you've been to the destination plane and are familiar with a location there, you may choose that location and arrive on target at that location with anyone else you transport with the spell.

**Augmented** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you grant transported creatures the effects of a _ [planar adaptation](/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/spells/planarAdaptation.html#_planar-adaptation)_ spell upon arrival, lasting for 1 hour.
