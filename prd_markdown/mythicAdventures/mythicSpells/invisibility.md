Invisibility

**Source** [_invisibility_](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)

The invisible target can't be detected with _ [detect magic](spells/detectMagic.md#_detect-magic)_ or other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility)_ or _ [glitterdust](spells/glitterdust.md#_glitterdust)_), though _ [true seeing](spells/trueSeeing.md#_true-seeing)_ and _ [dust of appearance](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_dust-of-appearance)_ can reveal the invisible target's presence.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.
