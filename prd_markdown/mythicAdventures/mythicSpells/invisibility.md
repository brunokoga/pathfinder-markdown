Invisibility

**Source** [_invisibility_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility)

The invisible target can't be detected with _ [detect magic](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic)_ or other spells that detect magic auras. The invisibility can't be penetrated, revealed, or dispelled by spells of 2nd level or lower (such as _ [see invisibility](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility)_ or _ [glitterdust](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/glitterdust.html#_glitterdust)_), though _ [true seeing](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing)_ and _ [dust of appearance](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_dust-of-appearance)_ can reveal the invisible target's presence.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the invisible target is undetectable by blindsense, blindsight, scent, and tremorsense.
