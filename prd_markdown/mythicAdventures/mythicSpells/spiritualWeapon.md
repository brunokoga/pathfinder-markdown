**Source** [_spiritual weapon_](spells/spiritualWeapon.md#_spiritual-weapon)

The weapon gains your choice of one of the following magic weapon special abilities: _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming)_, _ [frost](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-frost)_, _ [keen](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-keen)_, _ [merciful](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-merciful)_, _ [shock](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-shock)_, or _ [thundering](magicItems/weapons.md#_thundering)_. Before or after the weapon attempts all of its attacks for the round, you can redirect it to a different target as a swift action instead of a move action.
