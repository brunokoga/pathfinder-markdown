Enervation

**Source** [_enervation_](spells/enervation.md#_enervation)

The number of negative levels inflicted increases to 1d6, and the target is sickened for 24 hours. An undead creature struck by the ray gains 1d6 Ã— 5 temporary hit points for a number of hours equal to your caster level.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, any creature attempting to remove the target's negative levels must succeed at a caster level check (DC 10 + your caster level + your tier).
