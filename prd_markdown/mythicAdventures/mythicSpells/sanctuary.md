Sanctuary

**Source** [_sanctuary_](spells/sanctuary#_sanctuary)

If an attacker succeeds at its Will save to attack the protected target, add your tier to the target's AC against the attack. If the target uses a healing spell or ability on another creature, that creature gains the benefit of non-mythic _sanctuary_ for 1 round. If the creature breaks the non-mythic _sanctuary_ by attacking, subsequent healing by the target doesn't create another non-mythic _sanctuary_ effect on the creature.

**Augmented (2nd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, select a number of additional creatures equal to half your tier that are within reach. These creatures gain the benefit of non-mythic _sanctuary_.
