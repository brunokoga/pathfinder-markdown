Lightning Arc

**Source** [_lightning arc_](ultimateMagic/spells/lightningArc#_lightning-arc)

The damage dealt increases to 1d8 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d8). A target that fails its save is blinded by the flash for 1 round and deafened by thunder for 1d4 rounds.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the two targets can be up to 120 feet apart, the lightning can turn once up to 90 degrees to connect the targets, and the spell's electrical damage bypasses electricity resistance and electricity immunity.
