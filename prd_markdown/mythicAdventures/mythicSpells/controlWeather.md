Control Weather

**Source** [_control weather_](spells/controlWeather#_control-weather)

The casting time changes to 1 standard action, and the duration doubles. The weather changes after a number of rounds equal to 11 – your tier.

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you can create weather of any type regardless of the season, and the weather changes after 1 round.
