Feast of Ashes

On a failed save, the target immediately takes 1d6 points of nonlethal damage per tier. Add your tier to the DC of any further Constitution checks the target attempts to resist the effects of starvation as part of this spell's effects. While the curse is in effect, the target gains no benefit from any spell, effect, or item that requires eating, such as the food from a _ [heroes' feast](spells/heroesFeast.md#_heroes-feast)_ spell (though the food is still used up when the target eats it).
