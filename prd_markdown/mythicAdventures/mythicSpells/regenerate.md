Regenerate

**Source** [_regenerate_](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/regenerate.html#_regenerate)

The casting time changes to 1 standard action and the target changes to 1 living creature or corpse touched. The spell removes the blinded, dazzled, and deafened conditions. The target gains regeneration equal to your tier (overcome by acid and fire) for 1 round per caster level. If the target was killed by amputation or decapitation (such as from a _ [vorpal](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_vorpal)_ weapon) within the past 1 round, the spell regenerates lost body parts and brings the creature back to life (as _ [breath of life](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/breathOfLife.html#_breath-of-life)_), treating it as if it had negative hp equal to its Constitution score.
