Meteor Swarm

**Source** [_meteor swarm_](spells/meteorSwarm#_meteor-swarm)

The meteors created by this spell deal bludgeoning damage in a line extending from you to the target destination where it explodes. Creatures in the path of a meteor take 2d10 points of bludgeoning damage and must succeed at a Fortitude save or be knocked prone. The damage from the exploding meteors increases to 6d10 points of fire damage. Creatures that fail their Reflex saves against the fire damage are also knocked prone and deafened for 1d4 rounds.

**Augmented (10th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, creatures in the path of a meteor also take 4d10 points of fire damage and the damage from the exploding meteors increases to 10d10 points of fire damage; this fire damage bypasses fire resistance and fire immunity.
