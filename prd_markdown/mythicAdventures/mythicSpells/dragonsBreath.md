Dragon's Breath

**Source** [_dragon's breath_](advanced/spells/dragonSBreath.md#_dragon's-breath)

The spell's duration changes to 1 minute/level or until discharged. You can use the [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) up to three times during this duration. On the round you cast the spell, using the breath weapon is a free action; later uses require a standard action. You must wait 1d4 rounds between each use of the breath weapon. All uses for a particular casting have the same range, area, and energy type. You can have only one _dragon's breath_ spell in effect at a time; casting a new one ends the previous one.
