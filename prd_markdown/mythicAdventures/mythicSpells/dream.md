Dream

You or the messenger may gain information from the dreamer you contact by asking questions as if using _ [speak with dead](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/speakWithDead.html#_speak-with-dead)_ to speak with a corpse. An unwilling dreamer can attempt to resist this probing with a Will save (as _speak with dead_, using the DC _ [dream](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dream.html#_dream)_ would have if it allowed a saving throw). Answers to these questions are still generally brief and cryptic.
