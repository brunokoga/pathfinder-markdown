Vomit Twin

**Source** [_vomit twin_](advancedRaceGuide/featuredRaces/goblins.md#_vomit-twin)

Any spell you cast that has a range of touch, close, medium, or long can originate from the twin instead of you. The twin gains a deflection bonus to AC equal to your tier, and has hit points equal to double your caster level. The twin can attempt attacks of opportunity using your base attack bonus, but has no ability score modifiers, skills, or feats. It threatens an area appropriate for your size and wields a copy of the weapon you were wielding when you cast _mythic vomit twin_. If the twin's weapon is destroyed or disarmed, on your turn the twin generates a new weapon from its own substance. Its attacks deal damage using that weapon's die type.

**Augmented (5th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you create two copies when you cast the spell, and both can be active at the same time. If you instead expend three uses of mythic power, you create three copies when you cast the spell, and all three can be active at the same time.
