Shatter

**Source** [_shatter_](spells/shatter.md#_shatter)

Add your tier to your caster level when determining the maximum object weight you can affect. When targeting a crystalline creature, the spell's damage increases to 1d8 points of sonic damage per caster level (maximum 10d8). You may damage a single magical object as if it were a crystalline creature. If the spell destroys an object or damages a crystalline creature, broken shards litter the spell area or creature's space and act as caltrops.
