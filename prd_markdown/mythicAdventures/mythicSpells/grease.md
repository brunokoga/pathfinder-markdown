Grease

**Source** [_grease_](spells/grease.md#_grease)

If you cast _mythic grease_ on an area, add your tier to the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) DC to move within or through the area. If you cast it on a creature's armor or clothing, add your tier to its [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) checks and combat maneuver checks attempted to escape a grapple and to its CMD to avoid being grappled.

**Augmented** : You can expend two uses of mythic power to make the grease flammable. It ignites from any fire at least the size of a candle flame. If a greased area is ignited, any creature in the area on your turn takes 1d3 points of fire damage and might catch on fire. If a greased creature is ignited, it takes 2d6 points of fire damage, and might catch on fire; add your tier to the save DC.
