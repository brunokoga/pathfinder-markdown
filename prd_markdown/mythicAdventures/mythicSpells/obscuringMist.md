Obscuring Mist

**Source** [_obscuring mist_](spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)

The range increases to 50 feet, and the cloud's radius and height both increase to 50 feet.

**Augmented (3rd)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the range increases to 500 feet. The cloud's radius increases to 500 feet, and its height increases to 100 feet. Winds can't dissipate the mist unless the area of the wind affects the entire area of this spell. Areas of mist burned away by fire spells become obscured again 1d4 rounds after the fire effect ends.

If you're at least 6th tier and expend three uses of mythic power, the range increases to 1 mile, the cloud radius increases to 1 mile, and its height increases to 500 feet. The cloud is as resistant to wind and fire effects as the 3rd-tier version.
