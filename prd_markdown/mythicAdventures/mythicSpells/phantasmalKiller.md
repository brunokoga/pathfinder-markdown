Phantasmal Killer

**Source** [_phantasmal killer_](spells/phantasmalKiller.md#_phantasmal-killer)

If the target fails its Will save but succeeds at its Fortitude save, the phantasmal killer persists in the target's mind, giving it the dazed condition until your next turn. On your next turn, the target must attempt another Fortitude save against the phantasm. Success means it takes 3d6 points of damage; failure means it dies from [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear).

**Augmented (6th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, the spell can affect a living target that is immune to fear, illusions, or mind-affecting effects.
