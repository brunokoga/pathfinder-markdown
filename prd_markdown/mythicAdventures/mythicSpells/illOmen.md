Ill Omen

**Source** [_ill omen_](advanced/spells/illOmen.md#_ill-omen)

For the target's unlucky d20 rolls, it must roll three times and take the lowest result. Spending a move action to utter a prayer or good luck charm allows the target to roll twice instead of three times.

**Augmented (4th)** : If you expend two uses of mythic power, you afflict the target with especially foul luck. Any natural 20 it rolls counts as a natural 1 instead.
