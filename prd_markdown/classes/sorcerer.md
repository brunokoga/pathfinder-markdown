# Sorcerer

Scions of innately magical bloodlines, the chosen of deities, the spawn of monsters, pawns of fate and destiny, or simply flukes of fickle magic, sorcerers look within themselves for arcane prowess and draw forth might few mortals can imagine. Emboldened by lives ever threatening to be consumed by their innate powers, these magic-touched souls endlessly indulge in and refine their mysterious abilities, gradually learning how to harness their birthright and coax forth ever greater arcane feats. Just as varied as these innately powerful spellcasters' abilities and inspirations are the ways in which they choose to utilize their gifts. While some seek to control their abilities through meditation and discipline, becoming masters of their fantastic birthright, others give in to their magic, letting it rule their lives with often explosive results. Regardless, sorcerers live and breathe that which other spellcasters devote their lives to mastering, and for them magic is more than a boon or a field of study; it is life itself.

**Role** : Sorcerers excel at casting a selection of favored spells frequently, making them powerful battle mages. As they become familiar with a specific and ever-widening set of spells, sorcerers often discover new and versatile ways of making use of magics other spellcasters might overlook. Their bloodlines also grant them additional abilities, assuring that no two sorcerers are ever quite alike.

**Alignment** : Any.

**Hit Die** : d6.

## Class Features

All of the following are class features of the sorcerer.

**Weapon and Armor Proficiency** : Sorcerers are proficient with all [simple](../equipment.html#_simple-martial-and-exotic-weapons) weapons. They are not proficient with any type of armor or shield. Armor interferes with a sorcerer's gestures, which can cause her spells with somatic components to fail (see [Arcane Spells and Armor](wizard.html#_arcane-spells-and-armor)).

**Spells** : A sorcerer casts arcane spells drawn primarily from the sorcerer/wizard spell list presented in [Spell Lists](../spellLists.html). She can cast any spell she knows without preparing it ahead of time. To learn or cast a spell, a sorcerer must have a [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score equal to at least 10 + the spell level. The Difficulty Class for a [saving throw](../magic.html#_saving-throw) against a sorcerer's spell is 10 + the spell level + the sorcerer's [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

Like other spellcasters, a sorcerer can cast only a certain number of spells of each spell level per day. Her base daily spell allotment is given on Table: Sorcerer. In addition, she receives bonus spells per day if she has a high [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score (see [Table: Ability Modifiers and Bonus Spells](../gettingStarted.html#_table-1-3-ability-modifiers-and-bonus-spells)).

A sorcerer's selection of spells is extremely limited. A sorcerer begins play knowing four 0-level spells and two 1st-level spells of her choice. At each new sorcerer level, she gains one or more new spells, as indicated on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. (Unlike spells per day, the number of spells a sorcerer knows is not affected by her [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) score; the numbers on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known are fixed.) These new spells can be common spells chosen from the sorcerer/wizard spell list, or they can be unusual spells that the sorcerer has gained some understanding of through study.

Upon reaching 4th level, and at every even-numbered sorcerer level after that (6th, 8th, and so on), a sorcerer can choose to learn a new spell in place of one she already knows. In effect, the sorcerer loses the old spell in exchange for the new one. The new spell's level must be the same as that of the spell being exchanged. A sorcerer may swap only a single spell at any given level, and must choose whether or not to swap the spell at the same time that she gains new spells known for the level.

Unlike a wizard or a cleric, a sorcerer need not prepare her spells in advance. She can cast any spell she knows at any time, assuming she has not yet used up her spells per day for that spell level.

**Bloodline** : Each sorcerer has a source of magic somewhere in her heritage that grants her spells, bonus feats, an additional class skill, and other special abilities. This source can represent a blood relation or an extreme event involving a creature somewhere in the family's past. For example, a sorcerer might have a dragon as a distant relative or her grandfather might have signed a terrible contract with a devil. Regardless of the source, this influence manifests in a number of ways as the sorcerer gains levels. A sorcerer must pick one bloodline upon taking her first level of sorcerer. Once made, this choice cannot be changed.

At 3rd level, and every two levels thereafter, a sorcerer learns an additional spell, derived from her bloodline. These spells are in addition to the number of spells given on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known. These spells cannot be exchanged for different spells at higher levels.

At 7th level, and every six levels thereafter, a sorcerer receives one bonus feat, chosen from a list specific to each bloodline. The sorcerer must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats.

**Cantrips** : Sorcerers learn a number of cantrips, or 0-level spells, as noted on Table: Sorcerer Spells Known under âSpells Known.â These spells are cast like any other spell, but they do not consume any slots and may be used again.

**Eschew Materials** : A sorcerer gains [Eschew Materials](../feats.html#_eschew-materials) as a bonus feat at 1st level.

## Sorcerer Bloodlines

The following bloodlines represent only some of the possible sources of power that a sorcerer can draw upon. Unless otherwise noted, most sorcerers are assumed to have the arcane bloodline.

## Aberrant

There is a taint in your blood, one that is alien and bizarre. You tend to think in odd ways, approaching problems from an angle that most would not expect. Over time, this taint manifests itself in your physical form.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (dungeoneering).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [enlarge person](../spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person)_ (3rd), _ [see invisibility](../spells/seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility)_ (5th), _ [tongues](../spells/tongues.html#_tongues)_ (7th), _ [black tentacles](../spells/blackTentacles.html#_black-tentacles)_ (9th), _ [feeblemind](../spells/feeblemind.html#_feeblemind)_ (11th), _ [veil](../spells/veil.html#_veil) _(13th), _ [plane shift](../spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift)_ (15th), _ [mind blank](../spells/mindBlank.html#_mind-blank)_ (17th), _ [shapechange](../spells/shapechange.html#_shapechange) _(19th).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell of the [polymorph](../magic.html#_polymorph) subschool, increase the duration of the spell by 50% (minimum 1 round). This bonus does not stack with the increase granted by the [Extend Spell](../feats.html#_extend-spell) feat.

**Bloodline Powers** : Aberrant sorcerers show increasing signs of their tainted heritage as they increase in level, although they are only visible when used.

_Acidic Ray [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can fire an acidic ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. The acidic ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

_Long Limbs [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 3rd level, your reach increases by 5 feet whenever you are making a melee touch attack. This ability does not otherwise increase your threatened area. At 11th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 10 feet. At 17th level, this bonus to your reach increases to 15 feet.

_Unusual Anatomy [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 9th level, your anatomy changes, giving you a 25% chance to ignore any [critical hit](../combat.html#_critical-hits) or sneak attack scored against you. This chance increases to 50% at 13th level.

_Alien Resistance [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 15th level, you gain spell resistance equal to your sorcerer level + 10.

_Aberrant Form [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 20th level, your body becomes truly unnatural. You are immune to critical hits and sneak attacks. In addition, you gain blindsight with a range of 60 feet and [damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/—.

## Abyssal

Generations ago, a demon spread its filth into your heritage. While it does not manifest in all of your kin, for you it is particularly strong. You might sometimes have urges to chaos or evil, but your destiny (and [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)) is up to you.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (planes).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [cause fear](../spells/causeFear.html#_cause-fear)_ (3rd), _ [bull's strength](../spells/bullSStrength.html#_bull-s-strength)_ (5th), _ [rage](../spells/rage.html#_rage)_ (7th), _ [stoneskin](../spells/stoneskin.html#_stoneskin)_ (9th), _ [dismissal](../spells/dismissal.html#_dismissal)_ (11th), _ [transformation](../spells/transformation.html#_transformation)_ (13th), _ [greater teleport](../spells/teleport.html#_teleport-greater)_ (15th), _ [unholy aura](../spells/unholyAura.html#_unholy-aura)_ (17th), _ [summon monster IX](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-ix)_ (19th).

**Bonus Feats** : [Augment Summoning](../feats.html#_augment-summoning), [Cleave](../feats.html#_cleave), [Empower Spell](../feats.html#_empower-spell), [Great Fortitude](../feats.html#_great-fortitude), [Improved Bull Rush](../feats.html#_improved-bull-rush), [Improved Sunder](../feats.html#_improved-sunder), [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), [Skill Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus) ( [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [planes]).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell of the [summoning](../magic.html#_summoning) subschool, the creatures summoned gain [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)/good equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the creature might have.

**Bloodline Powers** : While some would say that you are possessed, you know better. The demonic influence in your blood grows as you gain power.

_Claws [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 1st level, you can grow claws as a free action. These claws are treated as natural weapons, allowing you to make two claw attacks as a full attack action using your full base attack bonus. These attacks deal 1d4 points of damage each (1d3 if you are Small) plus your [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength) modifier. At 5th level, these claws are considered magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction). At 7th level, the damage increases by one step to 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if you are Small). At 11th level, these claws become _flaming_ _weapons_, each dealing an additional 1d6 points of fire damage on a successful hit. You can use your claws for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

_Demon Resistances [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain resist electricity 5 and a +2 bonus on [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) made against poison. At 9th level, your resistance to electricity increases to 10 and your bonus on poison [saving throws](../combat.html#_saving-throws) increases to +4.

_Strength of the Abyss [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 9th level, you gain a +2 inherent bonus to your [Strength](../gettingStarted.html#_strength). This bonus increases to +4 at 13th level, and to +6 at 17th level.

_Added Summonings [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 15th level, whenever you summon a creature with the demon subtype or the fiendish template using a _ [summon monster](../spells/summonMonster.html#_summon-monster-i)_ spell, you summon one additional creature of the same kind.

_Demonic Might_ _ [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 20th level, the power of the Abyss flows through you. You gain immunity to electricity and poison. You also gain resistance to acid 10, cold 10, and fire 10, and gain telepathy with a range of 60 feet (allowing you to communicate with any creature that can speak a language).

## Arcane

Your family has always been skilled in the eldritch art of magic. While many of your relatives were accomplished wizards, your powers developed without the need for study and practice.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) (any one).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [identify](../spells/identify.html#_identify)_ (3rd), _ [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility)_ (5th), _ [dispel magic](../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)_ (7th), _ [dimension door](../spells/dimensionDoor.html#_dimension-door) _(9th), _ [overland flight](../spells/overlandFlight.html#_overland-flight) _(11th), _ [true seeing](../spells/trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing)_ (13th), _ [greater teleport](../spells/teleport.html#_teleport-greater)_ (15th), _ [power word stun](../spells/powerWordStun.html#_power-word-stun)_ (17th), _ [wish](../spells/wish.html#_wish)_ (19th).

**Bonus Feats** : [Combat Casting](../feats.html#_combat-casting), [Improved Counterspell](../feats.html#_improved-counterspell), [Improved Initiative](../feats.html#_improved-initiative), [Iron Will](../feats.html#_iron-will), [Scribe Scroll](../feats.html#_scribe-scroll), [Skill Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus) ( [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [arcana]), [Spell Focus](../feats.html#_spell-focus), [Still Spell](../feats.html#_still-spell).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you apply a [metamagic feat](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats) to a spell that increases the slot used by at least one level, increase the spell's DC by +1. This bonus does not stack with itself and does not apply to spells modified by the [Heighten Spell](../feats.html#_heighten-spell) feat.

**Bloodline Powers** : Magic comes naturally to you, but as you gain levels you must take care to prevent the power from overwhelming you.

_Arcane Bond_ _ [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 1st level, you gain an [arcane bond](wizard.html#_arcane-bond), as a wizard equal to your sorcerer level. Your sorcerer levels stack with any wizard levels you possess when determining the powers of your familiar or bonded object. This ability does not allow you to have both a familiar and a bonded item. Once per day, your bond item allows you to cast any one of our spells known (unlike a wizard's bonded item, which allows him to cast any one spell in his spellbook).

_Metamagic Adept [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 3rd level, you can apply any one metamagic feat you know to a spell you are about to cast without increasing the casting time. You must still expend a higher-level spell slot to cast this spell. You can use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 19th level. At 20th level, this ability is replaced by arcane apotheosis.

_New Arcana [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 9th level, you can add any one spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list to your list of spells known. This spell must be of a level that you are capable of casting. You can also add one additional spell at 13th level and 17th level.

_School Power [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 15th level, pick one school of magic. The DC for any spells you cast from that school increases by +2. This bonus stacks with the bonus granted by [Spell Focus](../feats.html#_spell-focus).

_Arcane Apotheosis [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 20th level, your body surges with arcane power. You can add any [metamagic feats](../feats.html#_metamagic-feats) that you know to your spells without increasing their casting time, although you must still expend higher-level spell slots. Whenever you use magic items that require charges, you can instead expend spell slots to power the item. For every three levels of spell slots that you expend, you consume one less charge when using a magic item that expends charges.

## Celestial

Your bloodline is blessed by a celestial power, either from a celestial ancestor or through divine intervention. Although this power drives you along the path of good, your fate (and [alignment](../additionalRules.html#_alignment)) is your own to determine.

**Class Skill** : Heal.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [bless](../spells/bless.html#_bless)_ (3rd), _ [resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy) _(5th), _ [magic circle against evil](../spells/magicCircleAgainstEvil.html#_magic-circle-against-evil)_ (7th), _ [remove curse](../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)_ (9th),_ [flame strike](../spells/flameStrike.html#_flame-strike)_ (11th), _ [greater dispel magic](../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic-greater)_ (13th), _ [banishment](../spells/banishment.html#_banishment)_ (15th), _ [sunburst](../spells/sunburst.html#_sunburst)_ (17th),_ [gate](../spells/gate.html#_gate) _(19th).

**Bonus Feats** : [Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge), [Extend Spell](../feats.html#_extend-spell), [Iron Will](../feats.html#_iron-will), [Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility), [Mounted Combat](../feats.html#_mounted-combat), [Ride-By Attack](../feats.html#_ride-by-attack), [Skill Focus](../feats.html#_skill-focus) ( [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) [religion]), [Weapon Finesse](../feats.html#_weapon-finesse).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell of the [summoning](../magic.html#_summoning) subschool, the creatures summoned gain [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction)/evil equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level (minimum 1). This does not stack with any [DR](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) the creature might have.

**Bloodline Powers** : Your celestial heritage grants you a great many powers, but they come at a price. The lords of the higher planes are watching you and your actions closely.

_Heavenly Fire [(Sp)](../glossary.html#_spell-like-abilities-sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash a ray of heavenly fire as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. Against evil creatures, this ray deals 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. This damage is divine and not subject to energy resistance or immunity. This ray heals good creatures of 1d4 points of damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. A good creature cannot benefit from your heavenly fire more than once per day. Neutral creatures are neither harmed nor healed by this effect. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your [Charisma](../gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier.

_Celestial Resistances [(Ex)](../glossary.html#_extraordinary-abilities-ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and resist cold 5. At 9th level, your resistances increase to 10.

_Wings of Heaven [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 9th level, you can sprout feathery wings and fly for a number of minutes per day equal to your sorcerer level, with a speed of 60 feet and good maneuverability. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.

_Conviction [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 15th level, you can reroll any one ability check, attack roll, skill check, or [saving throw](../combat.html#_saving-throws) you just made. You must decide to use this ability after the die is rolled, but before the results are revealed by the GM. You must take the second result, even if it is worse. You can use this ability once per day.

_Ascension [(Su)](../glossary.html#_supernatural-abilities-su)_: At 20th level, you become infused with the power of the heavens. You gain immunity to acid, cold, and petrification. You also gain resist electricity 10, resist fire 10, and a +4 racial bonus on saves against poison. Finally, you gain unlimited use of the wings of heaven ability. Finally, you gain the ability to speak with any creature that has a language (as per the _ [tongues](../spells/tongues.html#_tongues) _spell).

## Destined
