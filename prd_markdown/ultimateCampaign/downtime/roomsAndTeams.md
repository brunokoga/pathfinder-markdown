# Rooms and Teams

Many players want to run inns, found mercenary companies, build temples, or lead cabals of mages. The downtime system allows you to do this by presenting small constituent units: rooms for constructing buildings and teams for forming organizations.

A room can be as simple as a 10-foot-by-10-foot area surrounded by wooden walls, or as complex as a stone-walled guard tower with a heavy wooden gate. A team can be as simple as a few beggars or pickpockets, as skilled as a group of acolytes trained in the healing arts, or as dangerous as a band of veteran mercenary soldiers. The details of the room or team are left vague to allow you greater versatility—they provide the game mechanics for your building or organization, but you decide the layout or hierarchy that suits your aesthetics.

Each room and team costs one or more kinds of capital (gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic). When you construct a building or create an organization, determine what rooms or teams you want, add up the gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic prices for these rooms, and spend that capital to begin construction or start recruiting.

**Constructing Buildings from Rooms** : If you are constructing a building, you can connect these rooms in any way you see fit using normal doors and hallways, or fit them together without interior partitions into a large common space. Unless otherwise stated, each room includes a floor, ceiling, walls, furniture, doors, windows, and other details that are appropriate to the room's purpose in your building.

_Example_: A Common Room is a large area designed for use by many people at once. In a Fort, a Common Room has tables and chairs and functions as a mess hall for soldiers. In a Tavern or Inn, it has tables and chairs and is the main place for socializing and drinking. In a Temple, it has chairs or pews and is used for conducting worship services. In a Bardic College, it has chairs and music stands and is used for practicing performances.

Exterior doors are good wooden doors with simple locks. Interior doors are simple wooden doors with no locks. You may install different locks by paying the normal price for locks.

You don't need to construct all of a building's rooms at once. The price of constructing a two-room building is the same whether you build them together or complete the first one and add the second one later.

**Broken Rooms:** If a room takes damage in excess of half its hit points (or is otherwise rendered sufficiently damaged by a downtime event or at the GM's discretion), it gains the broken condition. A room with the broken condition generates half the normal income. In general, repairing a broken room requires spending an amount of gp or other capital equal to half the price of constructing the room from scratch. Certain building events may have alternative prices for repairing rooms with the broken condition.

Entire buildings can also gain the broken condition. Treat the building as if each room in it had the condition, except you must repair the entire building at once rather than repairing rooms one at a time.

**Creating Organizations from Teams** : Unless otherwise stated, the people on a team have clothing, a small amount of personal gear appropriate to their line of work, and a place to live—in other words, lives outside of their involvement with you. You may outfit them with better gear and construct or purchase a place for them to live.

You don't need to add every team to your organization at once. The price for recruiting a team of beggars and a team of burglars is the same whether you recruit them together or recruit one and add the second team later.

The composition of a team is flexible and can change over time depending on the nature of your organization. For example, if your thieves' guild has Cutpurses and Robbers, some of them might get caught and jailed, but it is assumed your organization replaces them with individuals of similar skill. In the same way that you don't have to track routine maintenance on a building you own, replacing individuals who leave your organization is factored into the price of the team.

You can only recruit a team if the character levels of its individual members are equal to or lower than your [Leadership](feats#_leadership) score. Even if you don't have the [Leadership](feats#_leadership) feat, calculate your [Leadership](feats#_leadership) score as your character level + your Charisma modifier.

Unless otherwise noted, the members of a team are not adventurers and are unwilling to accompany you into dungeons and other deadly locations.

_Example_: An Acolyte is a low-level divine spellcaster. In a Cult, Acolytes are the lowest-ranked members of the group and handle most of the interactions with new converts. In a Thieves' Guild, they are responsible for patching up members of the guild after a robbery or gang war. In a Mercenary Company, they look after the spiritual needs and physical injuries of the soldiers.

**Teams and Leadership** : One advantage of having followers from the [Leadership](feats#_leadership) feat is that they increase the effect of Influence and Labor you spend in a settlement. As the primary component of the price of recruiting teams is Influence, having followers in a settlement makes it easier to get the word out about the organization you want to build.

The people in your organization obey you because you pay them, or at least keep regular contact with them and direct their activities. Unlike with cohorts and followers gained from the [Leadership](feats#_leadership) feat (who are loyal toward you because of your reputation and behavior), if you're away from your organization for a long period of time, you might lose your connection with it. In the [Upkeep Phase section](ultimateCampaign/kingdomsAndWar/kingdomBuilding#_upkeep-phase), see Step 3—Determine Capital Attrition.

In addition to the ways to combat attrition mentioned in the Upkeep Phase section, recruiting your followers into your organization can help with this problem. You can automatically add followers to your organizations as you recruit teams. For every five of your followers who are also members of your organization, you gain a +1 bonus on the leadership check to avoid attrition. As most followers are low-level characters with NPC classes, most teams of followers aren't trained for combat and are usually recruited to be Acolytes, Bureaucrats, Craftspeople, Lackeys, and so on.

**Combining Rooms and Teams** : This system allows you to construct a building that has no workers, create an organization that has no base of operations, or combine the two to make a fully staffed building or an organization with a headquarters. For example, if you build a Temple and recruit Acolytes in that settlement, you can have the Acolytes work at your temple. If the Temple has a place for the Acolytes to sleep, they can even live there. If you later want the Acolytes to go somewhere else or disperse, you still have the Temple and can use it for whatever purpose you see fit.

## Reading a Unit Stat Block

The unit stat blocks are essentially the same for rooms and teams, and are organized as follows. Where an entry in a stat block would have no value (for example, a room that can't be upgraded from or into something else), that entry is omitted from the stat block.

**Earnings** : This entry indicates what bonuses the room or team gives to its building's or organization's checks made to generate capital. Buildings and organizations act like characters in that they can attempt a check each day to earn capital performing skilled work (without costing you any downtime). You must pay for capital earned in this way as normal.

If the room or team's Earnings entry says "capital" and a number, it can contribute a bonus on the building's or organization's skilled work check for any type of capital (gp, Goods, Influence, Labor, or Magic). If the Earnings entry lists specific types of capital, it can contribute a bonus on its building's or organization's skilled work checks only for capital of those types. You can apply each room's or team's bonus to any one listed type or capital each day or divide it among multiple listed types of capital. For example, an Alchemy Lab can generate only gp, Goods, or Magic, and not Influence or Labor. One day you could use all +10 of its bonus on the building's capital check to generate gp, on the next day you could use +5 on a check for generating gp and +5 on a check for generating Goods, and so on.

Most of the time, it's simplest and quickest to just apply all the gp bonuses from all the rooms in each of your buildings and take 10 on the roll. Other times, you might want to generate other types of capital to construct new rooms, recruit new teams, and make upgrades.

If you have multiple buildings or organizations in a settlement and they can generate the same kind of capital, you don't have to roll for them separately—you may add all their capital modifiers together and attempt one check for that kind of capital. If you spend a downtime day earning capital on your own, you may add your building and organization bonuses to your roll instead of rolling separately for yourself and each of your businesses or organizations.

For a room, the Earnings amount already subtracts the cost of having unskilled employees to do the basic work for you. For example, the Earnings listed for having a Bar already account for the wages of a bartender and servers. For a team, the Earnings amount assumes they are working at a building you own. If you don't provide a building for the team to work in or from, halve the Earnings for that team.

The description section of the unit stat block might list other benefits unrelated to the downtime system.

_Example_: The Inn example in the sidebar on page 92 has a Bar, a Common Room, a Kitchen, a Lodging, and a Stall. The Bar gives gp or Influence +10; the Common Room gives gp or Influence +7; the Kitchen gives gp or Goods +4; the Lodging gives gp +12; and the Stall gives gp, Goods, or Labor +8. All of those rooms can earn gp, so if you want to earn gp, just add all the room bonuses together (total +41) and make a skilled work check for the Inn to see how much gp you earn (see page 78). If you wanted to use the Bar's bonus to contribute to generating Influence and use the rest of the rooms' bonuses on gp, you'd attempt one skilled work check for Influence with a +10 modifier (the Bar's bonus) and another skilled work check for gp with a +31 modifier (the total bonuses from the Common Room, Lodging, and Stall).

**Benefit (Rooms Only)** : This entry lists what non-downtime bonuses the room provides, such skill bonuses or changes to settlement modifiers (such as Corruption, Crime, and Danger). If a room provides a skill bonus, that bonus applies only when you're in the location specified. For example, just because you have a Ballroom in your castle doesn't mean you get its [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) bonus when you're in a dungeon.

The stat block doesn't list obvious benefits that aren't related to game mechanics. For example, a Bar allows you to sell drinks, a Kitchen allows you to serve food (either for your personal guests or to paying customers if the building is an Inn), and a Magical Repository allows you to research spells.

**Create** : This entry lists how much Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic are required to construct the room or recruit the team. It also includes a gp value for purchasing a completed room of that type or recruiting an existing team of that type.

**Time** : This entry indicates how long it takes to complete the room or recruit the team. You may divide the Time price for a room by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Labor price. You may divide the Time price for a team by 2, 3, or 4 by spending 2, 3, or 4 times its Influence price. You must be in the settlement at the start of the construction or recruitment period, but don't have to spend any of your downtime days to begin construction or recruitment. In effect, you have to be present only to give the order to begin.

If a team doesn't have a Time price, spending capital to recruit that team doesn't count as a downtime action.

Note that the Time prices for teams are for recruiting the team for long-term employment and don't reflect the availability of these kinds of NPCs for temporary work. For example, if you need to hire a 3rd-level cleric to cast _ [lesser restoration](spells/restoration#_restoration-lesser)_, you don't have to spend 7 days of downtime recruiting a Priest team—you can just make standard spellcasting arrangements as described in the _Core Rulebook_.

**Size** : If the unit is a room, this entry indicates a range of how many 5-foot squares are needed for a standard room of its type. For example, a Kitchen is 2—6 5-foot squares. If you need a larger room of this type, construct two rooms and join them. If you need a smaller room of this size, you can make it that smaller size for free. For example, if you only need a 5-foot-square Kitchen, you can construct one at the listed price, even though the smallest size listed is 2 5-foot squares.

If the unit is a team, this entry indicates how many people are needed for a standard team of its type. Typically the team is no smaller than 50% of this amount and no larger than 150% of this amount. If you need a larger team of this size, recruit two teams and combine them.

**Upgrade** : Some rooms and teams are variants of or improvements on others. You can change the room or team into the listed upgrade by spending the difference in both capital and time between the original and the new one. For example, if your building includes a Book Repository and you want to upgrade it to a Magical Repository, you can either spend 1 point of Goods, 1 point of Influence, 1 point of Labor, and 2 points of Magic, or spend 270 gp (the difference between the Create entry for a Book Repository and a Magical Repository). You must also spend 4 days (the Time difference between a Book Repository and a Magical Repository).

Pay the price only for types of capital that increase. For example, if you are converting Bunks into Lodging, you spend 3 points of Goods, 3 points of Labor, and 6 days; even though a Lodging costs less Influence, you don't regain any Influence for performing this upgrade.

You can't downgrade a room or team. With the GM's permission, you may repurpose any room or team into another room or team as if the change were an upgrade.

**Description** : A description of the unit follows the statistics, along with more detail about the benefits of having the unit.

## Construction and Recruitment Delays

If the settlement's nature is contrary to the kind of building or organization you're trying to construct or create (such as a Black Market or Thieves' Guild in a settlement with low Crime and high Law settlement modifiers), the GM might decide that construction or recruitment takes 1d6 × 10% longer than normal (minimum 1 extra day) if you aren't monitoring the work.

You can shorten this extra time before or during the delay by spending 1 point of Influence, which reduces the additional time by 1d6 days (minimum 0 days of delay). You can instead have a cohort monitor the work, or hire a competent employee (see page 88) to do so; either of these options completely prevents the delay.

## Moving an Organization

You can move an organization to a different settlement by paying half the price of recruiting it. This price accounts for paying relocation expenses for your teams, hiring replacements for people unwilling to move, and so on. Arranging the movement of an organization usually takes 1d6 days per team in the organization; the time needed to actually move the teams is the amount of time it takes to travel from the old settlement to the new one. The organization provides only half its benefits during the time you are arranging the move, and none of its benefits while traveling to the new settlement.

Instead of moving an entire organization, you can move just some of the teams within that organization. For example, if your Thieves' Guild includes two Robber teams, you could move one of the teams to a different settlement by spending 2 points of Influence and 1 point of Labor (half the price of recruiting a Robber team in the new location). This otherwise works like moving an entire organization. You may add these teams to an existing organization in the new settlement or use them to create a new organization.

For an additional 200 gp, this area can be consecrated as holy or unholy ground. A corpse buried in holy ground cannot be animated as an undead creature. A corpse buried in unholy ground has a 5% chance every month of reanimating as an uncontrolled zombie. If you upgrade a Burial Ground, the area retains the consecration effect.

Cell

**Create** 5 Goods, 4 Labor (180 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 1—9 squares

This uncomfortable room can imprison 1 to 4 captives. It is typically nothing more than a stone room with a straw-lined floor, though some might have the barest of comforts, like cots or chamber pots.

**Create** 2 Goods, 3 Labor (100 gp); **Time** 4 days

**Size** 2—4 squares

This pair of tiny, linked rooms allows for private conversations. Alternatively, you may construct a hidden space that allows you to watch another room without being observed, such as through a peephole in a tapestry or mosaic. One side of this room provides a +4 bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks to hide from creatures in the adjoining room. A Confessional can be constructed in a way that allows this bonus to apply to creatures in both sides or just in one.

Courtyard

**Earnings** capital +5 (of a type the building already generates)

**Create** 4 Goods, 5 Labor (180 gp); **Time** 24 days

**Size** 20—40 squares

**Size** 8—30 squares

**Upgrades From** Burial Ground

This space is dedicated to the storage of prominent corpses. Above ground this space might take the form of a tomb. The duration of spells that preserve or protect corpses (such as _gentle_ _repose_) are doubled when cast on a corpse that remains in this room.

Defensive Wall

**Create** 5 Goods, 2 Influence, 5 Labor (260 gp); **Time** 12 days

**Size** 20—40 squares

This simple wooden wall, fence, or hedge surrounds your structure and provides a modicum of security. It is no taller than 10 feet, includes a single gate with a simple lock, and can be scaled with a DC 14 [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) check. It can be constructed as a stone wall—increasing the height by up to 10 feet and the [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) DC to 20—by doubling the price. If combined with a Guard Post, this can be a walkable wall with a parapet.

Dock

**Earnings** gp, Goods, Influence, or Labor +12

**Create** 7 Goods, 2 Influence, 6 Labor (320 gp); **Time** 20 days

**Size** 10—30 squares

This is a series of walkways and sturdy posts used to safely moor a water vessel such as a boat or ship. If attached to Storage, it allows you to easily move cargo to and from the water.

Dojo

**Earnings** gp, Influence, or Labor +8

**Benefit** counts as a training facility for training or retraining

**Create** 7 Goods, 1 Influence, 7 Labor (310 gp); **Time** 20 days

**Size** 15—30 squares

This open area is used for practicing combat or other physical skills. If used for combat training, it includes humanoid-shaped training dummies or silhouettes for target practice. Most Dojos include simple floor mats or straw pallets to cushion falls, plus racks containing nonlethal versions of standard weapons. If used by a Thieves' Guild, instead of combat the Dojo might instead focus on evasion training, picking locks, and disabling traps. You can use a Dojo to train up to 10 people at a time. It can be used as Bunks, though it is much less comfortable than using actual beds or cots.

Drawbridge

**Create** 8 Goods, 2 Influence, 5 Labor (320 gp); **Time** 6 days

**Size** 4—8 squares

This retractable bridge spans a pit, moat, or similar danger, allowing you to control access to an area. You can raise or lower the bridge by spending a full-round action to operate the mechanisms constructed on either side of the span. When raised, the bridge creates a wooden barrier (hardness 5, 40 hit points). If the Drawbridge is destroyed, it can be rebuilt in the same place for half the initial construction price.

Escape Route

**Create** 9 Goods, 9 Labor (360 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 6—12 squares

**Upgrades From** Secret Room

This is a hallway or tunnel leading to a hidden exit from the building. The exit door is typically a simple wooden door with an average lock ( [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) DC 20 to open). Either or both ends of the hallway can be secret doors ( [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) DC 20 to notice).

False Front

**Earnings** gp or Goods +2

**Benefit** bonus to [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) DCs

**Create** 4 Goods, 1 Influence, 4 Labor (190 gp); **Time** 12 days

**Size** 10—20 squares

**Upgrades To** Storage and Storefront (see below)

This simple, nondescript business uses an innocuous front to hide criminal dealings. It might appear to be a low-quality pawnshop or ill-stocked market. It has the bare necessities for functioning as the kind of business it pretends to be, but its true purpose is to conceal the nature of the building—typically a criminal enterprise or secret meeting place, such as a cult's sanctuary or a den of thieves. The room includes a secret door leading to the rest of the building. The room increases [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) DCs by 5 for those trying to notice unusual activity or determine whether the building is what it seems. Since a False Front contains both a false Storefront and false display area, its space can be upgraded to both Storage and a Storefront simultaneously (or upgraded to just one, leaving the remaining area unused).

**Create** 5 Goods, 4 Labor (180 gp); **Time** 12 days

It includes a strong wooden door with a good lock. You can improve this to an iron door for 500 gp. You can add a wooden portcullis for 500 gp or an iron portcullis for 1,000 gp. For an additional 80 gp, you can also count this room as a Gauntlet, allowing defenders to fall back and trap intruders here. You can construct this room in a tower layout (at no additional cost), which includes a second story that also counts as a Gatehouse. The listed price includes the cost of having unskilled employees as guards (1st-level commoners or experts with uniforms, but no armor or weapons). If the building has an Armory, these employees are armed and armored, but still mostly for show. If you want trained guards who can defend against dangerous intruders, hire professional guards or recruit a team of Guards or Soldiers. You can use a Gatehouse as a Tollbooth, which provides the same Earnings (gp or Goods +4). Any defender using the Gatehouse's defenses gains a +1 bonus on initiative checks and on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks against intruders at the Gatehouse.

The listed price includes the cost of having unskilled employees as guards (1st-level commoners or experts with uniforms, but no armor or weapons).

If you want trained guards who can defend against dangerous intruders, hire professional guards or recruit a team of Guards or Soldiers.

Depending on the building and settlement, a Lavatory might be an outhouse, a closet with a chamber pot, or a stool connected to an external system such as a cesspit or pig trough. If the building has a Sewer Access, you can automatically connect all Lavatories in the building to the settlement's sewer system (see page 101). The sanitation improvement from having a Lavatory mean residents, guests, employees, and others who frequent the building gain a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist contracting a disease while in the settlement.

If you construct this room from scratch, it grants someone who studies there for 1 hour a +3 bonus on a [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (arcana) check to answer a question.

## Construction Examples

The following are examples of how you can construct your own Inn using rooms or create your own Thieves' Guild using teams.

### Inn

Suppose you want to spend downtime constructing a friendly traveler's Inn. It needs a Bar so it can sell drinks, and a Kitchen so it can serve food. Guests need a place to eat and rooms to sleep in, so it must include a Common Room and a Lodging. To keep your guests' horses safe, it must include a Stall. By adding up all the Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic values in the Create and Time entries of the rooms' stat blocks, you get a total of 33 points of Goods, 3 points of Influence, 32 points of Labor, and 90 days. By spending that capital, after 90 days of construction time your inn is finished.

Alternatively, if you just wanted to purchase a completed Inn and the GM says one is available, you can add up the gp cost listed in the Create entries of the Inn's rooms and pay that amount to the current owner. For the friendly traveler's Inn described above, that total price is 1,390 gp.

### Thieves' Guild

Suppose you want to create a network of thieves and spies in town. You need eyes and ears on the street, so you should include a Cutpurse team. You want people to be able to break into homes and steal valuables, so you should include a Robber team. To hide your wealth from the tax collector, you need a Bureaucrat team. By adding up all the Goods, Influence, Labor, and Magic values in the Create and Time entries of the rooms' stat blocks, you get a total of 3 points of Goods, 11 points of Influence, 6 points of Labor, and 6 days. If you spend that capital, after 6 days of recruiting, your guild is ready to work.

Alternatively, if you wanted to just purchase an existing guild, with the GM's approval you can add up the gp prices for those teams and pay that amount to the current guildmaster. For the Thieves' Guild described above, the total price is 510 gp.

## Restrictions on Earnings

Whether a unit generates its listed capital depends on your intentions for the building or organization, and should follow common sense. For example, if you construct a building with a Bar, Common Room, and Kitchen, you might want to use it as a tavern or a headquarters for your adventuring party. If it's a tavern, it's open to the public and generates capital. Otherwise, it's a private building and doesn't generate capital because it's used by only you and your friends. If you start your own cult with Acolytes and Priests, you might decide they sell healing and generate income. If your thieves' guild has Acolytes, you might decide they only heal members of your guild, and therefore don't generate income.

If you intend for your building or organization to generate capital, you must explain to the GM how it does so. You can change the purpose of your building or organization (for example, renovating an old military barracks into an inn or turning your greedy cult into a generous one) and in doing so change the capital it generates. You should choose one idea and stick to it, however, as a business that's open to the public on an irregular basis makes less money, as does a business that frequently changes its purpose. The GM might reduce the capital buildings generate in such situations.

Trophy Room

**Earnings** gp or Influence +5

**Create** 6 Goods, 1 Influence, 5 Labor (250 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 4—20 squares

This is a place to hang trophies from your adventures, such as stuffed monster heads, rare paintings, strange statues, and old magic items you don't need any more. Because of the display cases and clutter, this room isn't much good for anything else, though it might include chairs or benches to allow people to sit while they admire your treasures. If you want to use your trophies to decorate another room instead of placing them in their own room, construct the Furnishings augmentation instead. A Museum makes money by charging visitors or sponsors to view items like these.

Vault

**Create** 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 4—8 squares

**Upgrades From** Reliquary, Storage; **Upgrades To** Secret Room

This is a secure room designed to keep out intruders. The access to this space is controlled by an iron door with a good lock. If you upgrade this room to a Secret Room, the door retains its material and lock and also becomes a secret door.

War Room

**Benefit** bonus on mass combat and skill checks while scheming

**Create** 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 4—12 squares

This is a room for planning military maneuvers, plotting grand heists, or providing briefings. It contains a large central table with plenty of chairs, maps, and figures to simulate troops and structures. When it's used for planning a battle, your army gains a +2 bonus on attack rolls and morale checks for their next battle within 24 hours. To grant the army this bonus, the army's commander must be present at the planning meeting for the battle or you must have some way of communicating these instructions to the commander. When used to scheme for an upcoming adventure (see page 87), a War Room allows you to use the scheme's planning bonus on two skill checks instead of one.

Workstation

**Earnings** gp, Goods, or Influence +8

**Benefit** counts as masterwork artisan's tools for one [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) or [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) skill

**Create** 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 16 days

**Size** 8—16 squares

This includes a table, chair, and appropriate masterwork artisan's tools for one [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) or [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) skill you choose when you build the room. For example, if intended for a carpenter, it has clamps, saws, nails, hammers, and a sturdy worktable. Up to three people can use the room at a time.

### Room Augmentations

Augmentations modify a room to be more productive, durable, or useful. Augmentations are permanent and can't be removed. If you upgrade a room you have augmented, the augmentation carries over to the upgrade, but the augmentation's cost isn't considered when you look at the difference between the base and upgrade room.

You can put more than one augmentation in a room, as long as they aren't the same augmentation.

Fortification (Augmentation)

**Benefit** increases room's durability

**Create** 8 Goods, 7 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 30 days

**Size** As original room

This upgrade can be applied to any room, reinforcing walls, improving doors, and treating or replacing flammable materials. Upon buying this upgrade, the room's walls have their hardness increased by +2, the doors are improved to strong wooden doors (hardness 5, hit points 20), and walls and floors gain fire resistance 5. This upgrade doesn't affect items within the room (for example, upgrading a Book Repository affects the structure, not the books within it).

Furnishings (Augmentation)

**Earnings** +5 on the room's check to generate capital

**Create** 9 Goods, 6 Labor (300 gp); **Time** 20 days

**Size** as original room

This upgrade adds fancy furnishings to one room, such as wooden paneling, marble floors, fine ceramic teacups, lifelike paintings, and canopies for beds. The decoration is appropriate to the nature of the room and building. For example, if applied to a Bar frequented by soldiers, it includes patriotic heraldry and placards memorializing war heroes.

Trap (Augmentation)

Adding a Trap augmentation to a room costs the same as adding a dedicated Trap room; see the Trap room on page 103.
