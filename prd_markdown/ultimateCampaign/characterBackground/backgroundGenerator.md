# Background Generator

The background generator is intended to remove the creative pressure that can sometimes frustrate players as they try to flesh out the murky details of their characters' backgrounds. This generator provides these details with either a simple roll of the die or the players deliberately selecting from options on the furnished tables and lists. Think of each element on the background generator's tables as a piece of story material that you can link together with other random pieces to create a story you otherwise might now have imagined. Use this tool to inspire creativity rather than as hard-and-fast rules to mandate rigid and seamless character backgrounds. Though the generator provides many foundational details of a character's background, it takes some creative thought to massage the specifics together. As you use the generator, feel free at any point to reject or reroll contradictory elements or ones that go against your vision of the emerging character. Like the background questions presented earlier in this chapter, the ideas on these tables are simply suggestions designed to channel and focus your imagination.

To generate a background, you roll on a number of tables and subtables, but before you do this, you must decide the gender, race, and class of your PC. Such decisions will help to inform the tables you'll use. After you've determined these basic character elements, you can begin using the background generator to determine your character's unique background by following the three steps summarized below, which are detailed further in the pages that follow.

**Step 1—Homeland, Family, and Childhood** : Determine the circumstances of your birth, your parents' profession, and a major childhood event. To determine the number of siblings you have, roll on the table appropriate for your race. For each sibling you have, roll d%; 01—50: the sibling is female, 51—100: the sibling is male. Then roll on the Relative Age of Sibling table to determine the relative age of the sibling.

**Step 2—Adolescence and Training** : Determine the circumstances and events that defined your adolescence and the training you received, as well as create an influential associate from this time in your life.

**Step 3—Moral Conflict, Relationships, and Vulnerabilities** : Determine a major conflict in your past, the other party involved, and how you resolved the conflict. Also determine your romantic relationships, relationships with fellow adventurers, and personality drawbacks.

While rolling on the tables in these three steps, you are sometimes granted access to a trait, story feat, or drawback. Upon gaining access to one of these rules elements, write it down. At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you've gained access to. If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection). When you gain access to a story feat, it means you've met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation.

### Step 1—Homeland, Family, and Childhood

The tables below determine the basics of your family and homeland. These establish the circumstances of your upbringing, the composition of your family, and your family's social standing, as well as a major event you experienced in childhood. To determine these aspects of your background, do the following:

1. Find the sections for your race and roll on the Homeland, Parents, and Siblings tables within the section. If you have siblings, also consult Relative Age of Sibling table and the [Race of Adopted Sibling table](table-race-of-adopted-sibling) to determine the relative age of your siblings and the race of adopted siblings.

2. Roll on the Circumstance of Birth table, to determine the circumstance of your birth. Based on those circumstances, you may have to roll on the subsequent tables to determine details of those circumstances.

3. Roll on the Major Childhood Event table to determine a major childhood event.

4. Proceed to Step 2—Adolescence and Training.

You gain access to the Fearless Defiance faith trait and the Arisen story feat. |
| 31—35 | **Fall of a Major Power** : In your early years, an old power with far-reaching influence fell into decline.

| 36—40 | **Fell in with a Bad Crowd** : In your youth, you ran with a brutal, evil, or sadistic crowd. You might have belonged to a gang, a thieves' guild, or some other nefarious organization.

| 91—95 | **Raiders** : A horde of raiders attacked your settlement and killed several of your people. This could have been a tribe of brutal humanoids or the conquering army of a civilized nation.

## Alchemist

Instead of wielding magic as divine and arcane casters know it, alchemists master fiery concoctions and mutagens by studying formulae that unlock the secrets of reagent reactions. Though some alchemists use their discoveries and knowledge of rare and exotic components to benefit the world, others are not so scrupulous with their powerful potables. Roll on the table below to determine what event inspired you to study alchemy.

[Alchemist Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Accidental Discovery** : Your keen intellect has always been an asset in your studies of the alchemical arts, but along with your logic and rationale, you have a "sense" for alchemy. This intuition sometimes leads to discoveries through methods most of your peers would never have thought possible, but that you somehow know will work. You gain access to the Alchemical Intuition magic trait. |
| 11—20 | **Firebug** : Although you've studied all aspects of the alchemist's craft, your have a talent for fire. Fire has always been a seductive and powerful force that you have either embraced with glee or focused care. You are adept at exploiting a weakness to fire when you recognize it. You gain access to the Focused Burn magic trait. |
| 21—30 | **Wasn't Strong Enough** : You suffered something at an early age that made you feel powerless. Maybe a relative died from plague, a friend was crushed beneath rubble you were too weak to move, or some other horrible tragedy occurred. You turned to alchemy to transcend the limitations of your physical form. Your relentless dedication has made your bolstering abilities more persistent. You gain access to the Enduring Mutagen magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **Magic for the Uninclined** : You were always interested in the arcane, but lacked the innate magic of sorcerers or the single-minded dedication possessed by wizards. As a disciple of science, the magic of faith was also closed to you. You dedicated yourself to alchemy, focusing on extracts that mimic the magic you once hoped to wield. That original interest in magic still grants you occasional rare insight into the workings of your formulae. You gain access to the Cross-Knowledge magic trait. |
| 41—50 | **Master Craftsman** : The first time you saw air mix with the shapeless goo of a tanglefoot bag or shielded your eyes at the heatless light of a sunrod, you became ensnared by the wonders of alchemy. You've since labored to learn the secrets to crafting such items. You gain access to the Alchemical Adept magic trait. |
| 51—60 | **Physician** : Alchemy was the natural outgrowth of your time spent learning the healer's craft. Your first extracts were the accidental byproduct of making poultices and elixirs. Continuing your studies, you found the natural compassion you had as a healer mixing with an alchemist's cold logic, forging you into a clinician unlike most others. You gain access to the Precise Treatment magic trait. |
| 61—70 | **Formulae Stickler** : To you, alchemy is a delicate and complex symphony requiring multiple different elements to work together to produce the perfect result. Though others in your craft come up with ways to substitute certain ingredients when making bombs or mutagens, you disdain such practices, deeming them pollutions. To you, there is always a perfect ingredient and its addition makes your alchemy more potent. You gain access to the Meticulous Concoction magic trait. |
| 71—80 | **Nature's Foe** : You lost something or someone important to you through the cruel indifference of nature. Perhaps you watched someone get swallowed by a storm-tossed sea or witnessed a summer forest fire destroy your home and all of your possessions. No matter the impetus, the unpredictability of nature made you feel small and helpless. Your subsequent devotion to alchemy has been in no small part due to a desire to exert control over nature itself, a domineering intent palpable to all creatures of nature. You gain access to the Unnatural Revenge social trait. |
| 81—90 | **To Recreate a Miracle** : Your life or the life of someone you loved was saved by a magical elixir. Witnessing this instilled a sense of awe for the art of alchemy. Although your research has not yet been able to recreate the sheer potency of that draught long ago, your years questing to duplicate it have made you adept at brewing potions. You gain access to the Perfectionist's Brew magic trait. |
| 91—100 | **Mad Alchemist** : Rampant curiosity and a near fearlessness of the unknown drove you to experiment with the rudiments of alchemy. That curiosity has uncovered interesting alchemical secrets, at the cost of alchemical instability. Some consider your experiments mad. You gain access to the Unstable Mutagen magic trait. |

## Barbarian

Barbarians are fueled by an almost supernatural rage that helps them loose the volatile stores of adrenaline within their bodies. This rage stays with the barbarian throughout her life as an adventurer, and she learns to refine her fits of passionate anger only over time. Yet each barbarian's rage is different and personal. It comes from the primal depths of her soul, and cannot be manufactured. Only a select few can channel that purest, deepest rage into overpowering combat prowess.

| 11—20 | **Champion of a God** : At your coming-of-age ritual, your deity, totem, or patron spirit sparked your soul with a religious zeal. This entity might be a beast spirit, a warmongering god, a demon lord, or some other supernatural entity. In the name of this otherworldly force you become an unstoppable warrior—the bane of all your tribe's foes. You gain access to the Inspired faith trait and the Champion story feat. |
| 21—30 | **Conquest** : Upon coming of age, you went on your first raid, where you learned the thrill of violence and chaos and the satisfaction that came with the spoils of your victory.

| 31—40 | **Hated Foe** : In your formative years, you learned to despise a certain individual, tribe, kingdom, empire, race, or monster due to some slight it inflicted upon you or your people.

You gain access to the Reckless combat trait and the Foeslayer story feat. |
| 41—50 | **Personal Flaw** : There is a part of yourself that you hate more than anything else. In your adolescence, you first realized this imperfection— to your lasting shame.

Your rage is fueled by self-loathing, or by projecting this part of yourself onto a foe you wish to destroy. You gain access to the Axe to Grind combat trait. |
| 51—60 | **Hatred of Civilization** : When you first encountered civilization in your youth, its weak and decadent people revolted you. Once, such people were free and strong, but rules and laws made them feeble. Your rage is the wild part—the pure part—of yourself that separates you from the craven ways of "civilized" people. You gain access to the Savage social trait. |
| 61—70 | **Persecution** : You grew up under the persecution of another power—perhaps a rival tribe, an expansionistic empire, or a tribe of violent monsters. Beaten and bloodied, your people barely survived the onslaught. But the beatings made you strong and taught you how to channel the pain into something useful. Since that time, the flame of rage has burned inside you, waiting to be released against your oppressors. You gain access to the Bullied combat trait. |
| 71—80 | **One of a Dying Breed** : You grew up knowing that your people were slowly dying out—that your extinction was inevitable in the face of the changing world. In youthful vigor, you declared that your fire would not be snuffed without a fight. Your rage stems from the desperate desire to be remembered, to make a mark upon the world before the sun sets on your dwindling kind. When you rage, a single thought permeates your burning mind: If you're going down, you're taking everyone with you. You gain access to the Reactionary combat trait. |
| 81—90 | **Chaos Embraced** : You grew up in wild lands where there were no laws except for those of nature—the laws of the predator and the prey. You searched for meaning in the world, in the gods, in the prayers of priests, in the patterns of the stars, but you found nothing. There is no true order to the natural universe except for that of raw and unbridled power. Chaos is the natural state of all things, and that's how you like it. You gain access to the Unpredictable social trait. |
| 91—100 | **Bloodthirsty** : The first time you spilled a deserving foe's blood and watched the thing's life ebb out onto the hard ground, you found yourself filled with a mad, euphoric ecstasy like none other. The memory of this visceral experience returns to you in every battle, like an insatiable addiction that can only be abated with further bloodshed. You gain access to the Bloodthirsty combat trait and the Innocent Blood story feat. |

| 11—20 | **Conscripted** : You didn't choose the military life so much as you were drafted into it. You have a non-military background and skill set. Who knows what course your life might have taken had you not been forced to take up arms? You gain access to the Worldly social trait. |
| 21—30 | **Duty** : You took up the sword because no one else would. When a great danger threatened your home, you stepped forth to meet the challenge, though you were only a youth with just the strength of your arm and steadfastness of your courage to see you through. You gain access to the Courageous combat trait. |
| 31—40 | **Gladiator** : As an adolescent, you learned to fight and kill because your master made you, and if you had not learned, you would be dead. Killing was a way of life—a means of survival. At first you did it because you had to, but that soon changed when you heard the chorus of the crowd. You gain access to the Killer combat trait, the Life of Toil social trait, and the Champion story feat. |
| 41—50 | **Joined the Watch** : Your village, town, city, or tribe needed new recruits for the volunteer watch patrol, and you joined up—whether for money, duty, peace, or power. This rudimentary training gave you an understanding of civilized justice and showed you how to wield a weapon with skill. You gain access to the Militia Veteran regional trait. |
| 51—60 | **Knighted** : Your military path began when you were knighted or made a squire to a knight. Your family's status could have influenced this event, or you might be a simple commoner rewarded with a title for a rare feat of courage. As a member of the nobility, you gain access to the Influence social trait. |
| 61—70 | **Mercenary** : Everyone needs to earn a living, and in your youth you were fast, strong, or tough enough to fight for pay. There are good causes and bad causes, but at the end of the day, it all comes down to money. Sometimes you got easy jobs, like guarding merchant caravans; other times the jobs are rough, like fighting in a rebel lord's private army. You gain access to the Mercenary social trait. |
| 71—80 | **On the Street** : You spent adolescence in a seedy part of town. You learned to fight dirty and fight mean. Turns out you were good at it. Your skills drew the interest of gang and guild leaders, tavern keepers, and anyone else who needed hired muscle. You gain access to the Child of the Streets social trait. |
| 81—90 | **Schooled** : You learned to fight in a structured environment where you were exposed to a variety of weapons, armor, strategies, and tactics. You learned to fight as part of a unit, how to follow orders and how to command a squad. You gain access to the Tactician combat trait. |
| 91—100 | **[Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival)** : You spent some part of your life in the wild—in places that abide by the laws of nature rather than those of civilization. You survived by being stronger, faster, and more cunning than the predators. That meant you fought not for coin, honor, or principle, but for your very life. You gain access to the Resilient combat trait. |

## Gunslinger

Armed with dangerous, emergent technology and blessed with death-defying luck and skill, gunslingers are practically born to be legends. But for every gunslinger who rises to epic fame as a hero or villain, another has been left lifeless at the hands of the weapon she sought to master. Regardless of this destiny, however, no other class is so wedded and intrinsically linked to a single kind of weapon as the gunslinger. How she came to possess, learn, and master the unique power of firearms forms the backbone of every gunslinger's current motivations. Roll on the table below to determine what event caused you to choose the way of the gun.

[Gunslinger Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Any Fool Can Swing a Sword** : Sometime during your youth, you came to the conclusion that most melee and ranged weapons are crude and primitive compared to firearms. It puzzles you that anyone with martial aptitude deigns to devote their skill to anything other than firearms. You disregard such "lesser" weapons and prefer the feel of your trusty firearm over any other tool of war. You gain access to the Reckless Contempt combat trait. |
| 11—20 | **Bucking Tradition** : You come from a proud tradition of ancient arms and august codes of conduct like those followed by paladins, cavaliers, and samurai. Instead of following in the vaunted steps of your predecessors, though, you chose to learn the art of firearms to the shock and perhaps even anger of your family and peers. Your break with tradition fostered in you a nearly insurmountable will that fuels your identity as a gunslinger. You gain access to the Resolve of the Rejected combat trait. |
| 21—30 | **Custodian of the Future** : Firearms are not just an effective implement for killing or a curious mechanical trinket; they are the next step in the technological development of your people. Your passion for the workings of your weapons has you constantly assembling and dismantling firearms to truly understand their mechanics. This ongoing dedication improves your ability to repair firearms and make them deadlier while in your skilled hands. You gain access to the Unblemished Barrel combat trait. |
| 31—40 | **Defining Moment** : Guns are inexorably linked to a moment where your life dramatically changed. Perhaps you were so sickly as a child that you couldn't turn a crossbow's winch or bend a bow, but firearms showed you that you could still hunt and fight. Perhaps you picked up a firearm in a desperate moment to help a wounded gunslinger and knew that you had just taken your first step along the same path. A firearm at your side instills in you a sense of purpose and destiny that no one can take away. You gain access to the Black Powder Fortune combat trait. |
| 41—50 | **Look at What I Can Do** : The lure of something new and showy drove you to first pick up a gun. Although several near mishaps taught you to respect the volatile weapon and the powder that powers it, you still enjoy doing trick shots and getting the oohs and aahs of a crowd. You gain access to the Black Powder Bravado combat trait. |
| 51—60 | **Mechanical Savant** : For you, the lure of firearms is not the effect they produce, but the science and mechanical process behind the effect. Your endless tinkering and perfectionism have made your own gun easier to upgrade. You gain access to the Just Like New combat trait. |
| 61—70 | **Black Powder Presence** : You grew up belittled and even beaten for not being the biggest or the strongest of your compatriots, family, or race. With no burgeoning aptitude for magic, you looked for some other way to exceed those who found superiority in brute strength—and you found it in gunslinging. You gain access to the Larger Than Life combat trait. |
| 71—80 | **Sacred Charge** : Your gunslinger training is more than just martial skill—it's a calling. Perhaps you are part of an elite group of guards serving and defending a temple or faith. Conversely, you might come from a land where firearms represent the pinnacle of your society's advancement or are the last vestige of those who came before. Your sense of higher purpose allows you to fight on and keep firing when winning seems impossible. You gain access to the Never Stop Shooting combat trait. |
| 81—90 | **Shock and Awe** : The sound and fury of gunfire is as potent a weapon as the pellets and bullets your weapon discharges. You live for the reflexive wince that others make when they jump at the sound of a firearm, and laugh heartily at the amazement you inspire in others with your cacophonous black-powder weapons. You gain access to the Startling Report combat trait. |
| 91—100 | **Some Things Are Stronger Than Magic** : You grew up either oppressed by magic cruelly wielded or loathing the elitism of those who possessed such arcane or divine power. Searching for something nonmagical that relies on skill and practice led you to the study and wielding of firearms. You relish trumping pompous spellcasters with a quick draw and a keen eye. You gain access to the Black Powder Interjection combat trait. |

## Inquisitor

Bolstering the ranks of both good and evil deities, inquisitors draw their power from unwavering convictions to the causes of their gods. Unlike clerics and oracles, however, inquisitors are less interested in the theological and metaphysical aspects of faith and belief than what they consider to be the harsh realities of defending that faith. Roll on the table below to determine what event made you temper your faith with stern judgment.

[Inquisitor Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Bureaucracy's Bane** : You chose the inquisitor's path because you have no taste for the petty rules and regulations that mire the leaders of your faith in inaction and inefficacy. You know that you are an instrument of your deity and that your directives do not require intercession by the less motivated. You gain access to the Focused Disciple faith trait. |
| 11—20 | **Chaplain** : You learned long ago that in the heat of battle and under the pall of war, even the most devout can waiver in faith. You subsequently dedicated yourself to stewarding the faith of soldiers and allies in times of great conflict. You gain access to the Battlefield Disciple combat trait and the Battlefield Healer story feat. |
| 21—30 | **Exemplar** : You found early on that you lacked the logic or the vocabulary to communicate the virtues of faith—more precisely, _your_ faith—to others. You decided that the best way to foster respect and appreciation for your god was not with words, but with action. You gain access to the Beacon of Faith faith trait. |
| 31—40 | **Failed Cleric** : Your original training in divine magic was as a cleric, but your faith eventually distilled into you the ability to hear lies and see weaknesses in the "unfaithful." You gain access to the Schooled Inquisitor faith trait. |
| 41—50 | **Faith-Bringer** : You know that in order to bring the light of your deity to others, you must traverse hostile territories and face even more hostile inhabitants. You gain access to the Weathered Emissary social trait and the Fearless Zeal story feat. |
| 51—60 | **False Witness** : You've seen innocent people suffer due to another's lies. While these injustices made you feel powerless, they've also kindled a desire in you to punish those who regard truth so cheaply. You gain access to the Vigilant Battler combat trait. |
| 61—70 | **Few Left to Safeguard the Faith** : You are the vanguard of your faith. Perhaps you are a pilgrim for a good deity in an unholy land, or the secret enforcer of a sect that operates in the shadows of the world. You are accustomed to working alone and with little guidance from the superiors of your church, trusting your own moral judgment to act on behalf of your god. This certainty acts as a defense against the magic of other, "lesser" deities. You gain access to the Disdainful Defender faith trait. |
| 71—80 | **Temple Detective** : Your ability to sniff out falsehood and see weakness in others made you uniquely suited to guard the religious houses of your order. You gain access to the Truth's Agent social trait. |
| 81—90 | **The Path of Righteous Rage** : Your faith does not manifest in calm prayer or serene meditation. You achieve the transcendent feeling of the divine when you are in the throes of battle for your deity. You gain access to the Indelible Ire combat trait. |
| 91—100 | **Zealot** : Your devotion is fanatical and your powers are clearly proof of your connection with the divine. Although you know that other gods bestow similar powers upon their own disciples, you either revile or pity those of "lesser" faiths. You gain access to the Zealous Striker faith trait. |

## Magus

The rare spellcasters known as magi dedicate themselves to the synthesis of two separate disciplines: sword and spell. This core of all magi can be embraced only with ambition and purpose. Roll on the table below to determine what event drove you to blend martial powers and magical ability.

[Magus Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **A Mage without Magic** : Early in your arcane training, you were exposed to antimagic. The powerlessness you felt from all of your magic being stripped away left you feeling desperate and helpless. You vowed to never be that helpless child again, to be strong in such moments, putting you on the path of the magus. You gain access to the Dispelled Battler combat trait. |
| 11—20 | **Conflicting Legacy** : You were born to a family or clan with two great pedigrees: one of magic and one of battle. Unable to choose either path for fear of alienating a mentor or parent, you sought to master both. Your dedication to the blending of martial and magical has been so intense that your martial prowess feeds your arcane power. You gain access to the Arcane Revitalization magic trait. |
| 21—30 | **Ready for Anything** : For you, the path of the magus is not about the fluid blend of disparate fields of study or conquering an insurmountable challenge, but the art of preparation for any obstacle that comes your way. A dedicated and logical person, you hone the magus affinity for operating all manner of magical devices from blind luck to a refined procedure. You gain access to the Pragmatic Activator magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **Lost Teacher** : Your magus training was interrupted when you lost your teacher through the displacement of your family, lack of funds to continue schooling, or the teacher's unexpected death. Despite this hardship, the time you spent with your mentor had already sown the seeds of your training and you've been able to continue on your own in the time since—ceaselessly seeking, reading, and learning from any magical text you can find. You gain access to the Self-Taught Scholar magic trait. |
| 41—50 | **Promise Keeper** : Your dreams of becoming a wizard were cut short by unfortunate circumstances, such as the death of your family or clan's matriarch or patriarch, hostile invading forces, conscription in the army, and so on. This forced you to become a protector and stunted the growth of your studies. Though you have successfully blended the two disciplines, you still long for the unfulfilled potential of your career as a wizard. You gain access to the Cross-Disciplined magic trait. |
| 51—60 | **Shameful Secret** : You come from either a proud military and martial background or a legacy of skilled wizards. When you developed an aptitude for two different powers viewed as incompatible by your family or teachers, it drove you to hide half of your abilities and to pretend full-blown competency with the other. Some of the tricks you used to perpetrate this deception have stayed with you to this day. You gain access to the Partial Protege magic trait. |
| 61—70 | **Spell Backfire** : At some point during your magical training, you attempted to cast a spell and failed. But rather than being wasted, the arcane energy reabsorbed itself into your body, waiting to be reused in some other way. When the arcane energy exploded outward through your staff or some other instrument you wielded, you received your first glimpse of the ways that magic could be repurposed—a versatility you retain today. You gain access to the Malleable Magic magic trait. |
| 71—80 | **Spell's Edge** : The first time you held a magic weapon and felt the thrum of arcane energy within, you knew that magic and melee were meant to be joined. Since that moment, magic weaponry has become symbolic of the most potent syntheses of your magus training, and your ability to create magical weapons and imbue mundane arms with magic still resonates with this focus. You gain access to the Bladed Magic magic trait. |
| 81—90 | **Vindication** : You spent your formative years trying to convince combat instructors of the virtues of magic and arcane mentors of the importance of strength in arms, only to be mocked and exiled from both disciplines. Since then, you've wandered from master to master, honing your knowledge of both fields of study to show them all that not only have you achieved power, but you've also eclipsed all those who shunned you. You gain access to the Arcane Temper magic trait. |
| 91—100 | **What If** : You don't know the meaning of impossible. Everyone around you thinks you have your head stuck in the clouds, but you continually strive to achieve things that have never been accomplished before—perhaps things that have never even been dreamed of. Bucking convention has brought numerous failures, but you've learned from your mistakes and are able to snatch victory over seemingly impossible odds. You gain access to the Inspired faith trait. |

## Monk

Masters of the martial arts, monks are the pinnacle of discipline and perfection. Wielding strange arms and stranger fighting arts, monks are defined by their training. Whether brought up as the protege of a grand master or self-taught through stolen glimpses into the windows of a secret school, a monk's story is emblazoned in every step, cut, and strike he makes. Roll on the table below to determine the origin of your exotic training.

You gain access to the Martial Manuscript faith trait. |
| 51—60 | **Nature's Disciple** : Just as many great masters learned and crafted styles from the beauty and majesty of nature, your fighting style comes from time spent in the wild rather than from formal training. You have seen firsthand how the mantis hunts, how the tiger swipes, and how the crane beats its wings. Your observance of the natural world gave you the ability to extrapolate combat forms without traditional training. You gain access to the Nature's Mimic combat trait. |
| 61—70 | **Secret Student** : Your teacher and fellow students grew up as part of a conquered people, forbidden to train at war and forced to conceal the fighting style as seemingly harmless dances and your weapons as mundane tools… until the day you all you could rise up against tyranny. You gain access to the Hidden Hand combat trait. |
| 71—80 | **Spirit Teacher** : Your martial training is both physical and metaphysical in nature, allowing you to unlock a higher state of consciousness that allows you to draw on the wisdom and power of long-dead masters. You gain access to the Spirit Sense faith trait. |

| 91—100 | **Wandering Savant** : Although you've received some formal training in exotic combat, you decided to put your skills to the test and further your learning by wandering the wide world. You gain access to the Wanderer's Shroud faith trait. |

| 11—20 | **Bones** : In your formative years, you were entombed or buried alive in a graveyard. For days, you lay within the grave until your terror strangely turned to comfort.

| 21—30 | **Flame** : A great fire consumed you and laid waste to the environment around you.

| 31—40 | **Heavens** : The night sky's mysteries have always enthralled you.

| 51—60 | **Lore** : You were able to speak before any other child your age. Rather than stumble through the rudimentary syllables of language, you spoke in full sentences, reciting the greatest literature of many languages in story, song, and poem. Sometimes you spoke of events that had not yet come to pass, and the wise came to seek your counsel. Your gift came at a cost, however—though your knowledge is vast, your body and mind carry a curse. You gain access to the Scholar of the Great Beyond faith trait. |
| 61—70 | **Nature** : You became separated from your family and lost in the untamed wilderness for many days, months, or years. The wilderness took its toll, but when you finally emerged from the wild, you were its master. You gain access to the Child of Nature religion trait. |

## Paladin

Champions of virtue and the rule of law, many paladins are called to their path at a young age. Some hear the whispers of celestial beings in their minds, while other are drawn down the path of the paladin by tragedy and a sincere desire to strike a blow to the evil that stalks the world. Paladins sometimes take on younger charges such as orphans or runaways during their journeys, and the seeds of goodness can be sowed into these impressionable youths to grow another knight on the quest for righteousness.

| 01—10 | **Divine Calling** : An otherworldly agent of law and good—such as an angel, empyreal lord, or perhaps some other celestial envoy of the gods—tasked you to be a divine champion. You accepted the calling (maybe grudgingly) because ultimately you realize that the laws of destiny and one's divine calling cannot be denied. In return, that celestial agent watches over you and makes sure you can fully realize your destiny and meet the course that has been set for you by a higher power. You gain access to the Blessed faith trait. |
| 11—20 | **Dread Penance** : You, or perhaps your family, owe a debt for some past wrongdoing or vice. Maybe you made deals with some unscrupulous loan sharks during a gambling binge or your not-so-distant ancestors were responsible for the persecution of a marginalized group of people. Whatever the offense, your past action hangs over your head and fills you with guilt. You've taken a solemn oath to make good on this past misdeed. Only then will you feel like your life is truly worthwhile. You gain access to the Oathbound faith trait. |
| 21—30 | **Holy Epiphany** : Your faith and purpose came in a brilliant flash of insight.

Whatever the nature of your epiphany, it guides your actions and gives you insights others lack. You gain access to the Inspired faith trait. |
| 31—40 | **Zealous Devotion** : Maybe your faith was not popular among those around you during your youth. Maybe you have strange or controversial views regarding your religion, and the other members of your congregation find your practices bizarre or insulting. Whatever the case, your faith is constantly being questioned regardless of your obviously pious nature, and such persecution only serves to embolden your zeal. You gain access to the Indomitable Faith faith trait. |
| 41—50 | **Moral Debt** : The world and all things material are intrinsically corrupt. All creatures are born with a moral debt, and only by fighting evil, upholding law, and championing the common good can one be truly free of that corruption. You work every day to pay off this debt and move those around you to do the same. You gain access to the Principled faith trait and the Fearless Zeal story feat. |
| 51—60 | **Mark of Faith** : You were born with the mark of your faith. Maybe at some point you rebelled against such branding, or it could be you've always accepted the mark as an indicator of your destiny. In either case, it was a harbinger of the paladin path. You gain access to the Birthmark faith trait. |
| 61—70 | **Righteous Mentor** : A paladin of note and great honor took you under her wing and taught you many things.

| 71—80 | **Warrior of Truth** : Early in your life, you learned that the philosophies of law and good not only create the best society but also reveal truths that would otherwise remain obscured.

| 81—90 | **Knight-Errant** : You know that evil stalks the world, and only one who is dedicated to the spread of good can stop these vile forces.

Your goal is the relentless pursuit to seek out evil and put it down. You gain access to the Seeker social trait. |
| 91—100 | **Terrible Secret** : You know a terrible secret about an ancient evil that threatens your homeland or perhaps even the entire world.

This at times contradictory path has led you many places in your travels, and the knowledge you have gleaned from your adventures continues to serve you well in your fight against the wicked. You gain access to the Scholar of the Great Beyond faith trait. |

## Ranger

Rangers are the hunters of legend. Although known for their ability to master varying environments and their dangers, rangers often achieve this expertise through the dedicated pursuit of their quarry. Though such a target could be a lost or kidnapped friend or a forgotten ruin, more often a ranger's target is a hated enemy, and no feature of the class lends itself better to the establishment of character than his favored enemy. While a professional headhunter might hone his skills to track down humans or other civilized folk, a ranger whose family was murdered by ravenous orcs likely has a different set of priorities while on the hunt. Roll on the table below to determine the formative events that led you to become a ranger.

You gain access to the Tireless Avenger faith trait and the Foeslayer story feat. |
| 11—20 | **Ancient Hatred** : The history of your people is a saga of struggle against another race. Though common among elves and orcs or dwarves and giants, many different races can have such longstanding animosity. Your choice of a favored enemy was a simple outgrowth of this racial antipathy. You gain access to the Knowing the Enemy social trait. |
| 21—30 | **Big Game Hunter** : Whether you sought out the thrill of hunting large prey or merely grew up in the shadows of creatures large enough to crush an entire village with a careless step, you have learned how to be quick and to size up weaknesses in those behemoths who seem to have none. You gain access to the Evasive Sting combat trait. |
| 31—40 | **Blood Cleansing** : Either you have forsaken your kinsfolk or they have forsaken you. Maybe you grew up among a wicked or corrupt people who you needed to escape, or maybe they exiled you for being different.

| 41—50 | **Bounty Hunter** : You have always been good at finding and extracting people from their hidey-holes. Most likely you hunt humanoids of either your own subtype or of one common to your region. You gain access to the Easy Way or the Hard Way combat trait and the Town Tamer story feat. |
| 51—60 | **Detached Observer** : You set yourself apart with a pall of cold logic that allows you to see weaknesses in members of your own race that you strive not to succumb to yourself.

You gain access to the Cold and Calculating combat trait. |
| 61—70 | **Divine Purpose** : Not all those who hear the voices of the gods can distill that echo into magical power like clerics or oracles.

You gain access to the Faith's Hunter combat trait. |
| 71—80 | **Nightmare Slayer** : From an early age, you stood up against some of the most terrifying creatures imaginable, facing off against creatures most mortals only dream of in their wildest nightmares.

You gain access to the Fearless Defiance faith trait. |
| 81—90 | **Opportunist** : You are an expert in creatures both common and exotic, particularly in terms of what valuable items you can harvest from their remains. The natural world exists for the benefit of those who know what to take, and you have learned how to scavenge pelts, toxins, and even rare spell components from your defeated foes. You might pick animals, magical beasts, or dragons as your dominant favored enemy—or humanoids if you're a particularly grisly trophy collector. You gain access to the Harvester social trait. |
| 91—100 | **Survivalist** : You were orphaned at a young age and left to fend for yourself in the wilds, or simply lived a life at the edge of society that required a constant scrabble for basic existence. You probably have animals or magical beasts (the edible ones) as your dominant favored enemy, and are adept at lying in wait and springing into action. You gain access to the Hunter's Knack combat trait. |

## Rogue

The rogue's path is one of cunning, quickness, skill, and stealth. One of the broadest character archetypes, the rogue is found among all walks of life—from highborn spies infiltrating the courts of kings to common criminals making their livings preying on passersby in the alleys and streets. Roll on the table below to determine how you came to the profession.

[Rogue Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Gang War** : Growing up in the backstreets of an urban jungle, you were forced to choose between surviving as a predator or suffering as prey. You affiliated with a guild, gang, or group of thieves and thugs, carrying out illicit missions to further their interests and sabotage those of rival gangs. You gain access to the Dirty Fighter combat trait. |
| 11—20 | **Greed** : No matter how much or little you had growing up, it was never enough. You discovered a talent for lifting items and coin purses from others' belts. The world always provided for you, and when you saw something you wanted, you learned to take it. You gain access to the Ambitious social trait and the Thief of Legend story feat. |
| 21—30 | **Poverty** : In your youth, you rarely had enough food to keep from starving. Poverty and hunger forced you to steal to survive, or to help your loved ones survive. You gain access to the Poverty-Stricken social trait. |
| 31—40 | **Spy** : You've always had an innocent expression and a silver tongue, so naturally you were recruited as a spy during your childhood. You could have come from any social class; you might have gathered information as an urchin on the streets or acted as servant to one lord while you reported to another. You gain access to the Fast Talker social trait. |
| 41—50 | **The Kill** : You killed someone when you were relatively young. You might have done it in self- defense, in anger, or as part of an initiation ritual. And it was easier than you suspected. Afterward, some individuals or groups started paying you to kill for them, and you made a lucrative career of assassination. You gain access to the Killer combat trait and the Innocent Blood story feat. |
| 51—60 | **The Trained** : Your early talent for feats of agility and acrobatics garnered you an experienced mentor. Impressed by your natural ability, this mentor taught you how to fight, dodge, and throw. He may have been a master thief, circus performer, fencing master, or swashbuckling pirate. You gain access to the Mentored social trait. |
| 61—70 | **Outlawed** : For reasons just or unjust, you became a fugitive at an early age. You have lived outside the light of society for some time, risking capture or punishment whenever you need to break the law again. You gain access to the Criminal social trait. See the Crime and Punishment sidebar on page 23. |
| 71—80 | **Thrill Seeker** : As an adolescent, you and your friends took turns daring one another to take risks, each new challenge inspiring greater excitement. Since then, you've become an adrenaline junkie, performing dangerous tasks in order to chase that high. You gain access to the Acrobat social trait. |
| 81—90 | **Henchman** : You've always worked for someone else. You do what you are told and in return you are appreciated by the boss, rewarded, and paid. You gain access to either the Oathbound faith trait or the Child of the Streets social trait. |
| 91—100 | **Scout** : Your natural ability turned into employment in an elite squad of stealthy infiltrators. You penetrate enemy lines, gather information, deliver coded messages, and sabotage enemy supplies. You likely work for a private individual or military order. You gain access to the Canter social trait. |

## Sorcerer

Wielders of power on a seemingly impossible scale, sorcerers are conduits of the arcane energies inside them. These powers stem universally from the sorcerers' distinctive bloodlines. Either linked to powerful scions of mystical power like angels, devils, or dragons or touched by the forces of destiny themselves, sorcerers prove that sometimes when magic is involved, either you have it or you don't. Roll on the table below to determine the event that made you aware of the forces at work within your own blood.

| 01—10 | **Awakened Moment** : At some point, the dormant power within you awakened with a fright. It might have been the first time you came close to a dragon, celestial, or genie. Or the moment could have come at the grave of a great ancestor or in a lush and verdant glen. What slumbered in your blood has never quieted, and you frequently draw upon the inspiration of your awakening. You gain access to the Ascendant Recollection magic trait. |
| 11—20 | **Dreams of Something Different** : The first hints of your exceptional nature came to you as fragments of remembered dreams or split-second visions. As these episodes increased in both frequency and clarity, they unlocked a power in your blood you didn't know you had. You gain access to the Strength Foretold magic trait. |
| 21—30 | **Failed Wizard** : Although your arcane aptitude was evident at an early age, you were pushed toward wizardry as the conduit for your magic. While you never mastered magic in this fashion, your time spent studying arcane tomes gave you obscure but often pertinent knowledge. You gain access to the Reluctant Apprentice magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **One of a Kind** : You know that sorcerous power comes from the blood, but as far as you know, none of your ancestors possessed your gift. You keep searching for the reason for your magical powers, which has led you to greater proficiency with divinations and a keen interest in the workings of your bloodline. You gain access to the Knowledgeable Caster magic trait. |
| 41—50 | **Outcast** : Driven away by your family and people, your arcane gifts have always inspired both fear and revulsion. You've become adept at spotting hostility in others who would despise you for your power. You gain access to the Outcast's Intuition magic trait. |
| 51—60 | **Proud Heritage** : You hail from a long line of prominent sorcerers with even more prominent ancestral features. Your acceptance of your bloodline brings with it a pride and imposing mien that becomes amplified among others. You gain access to the Imposing Scion social trait. |
| 61—70 | **Shameful Heritage** : The obvious hints of your heritage were a source of shame to your family. No matter the manifestation of your differences, being a pariah taught you to practice your arts in secret. You gain access to the Unseen But Not Undone magic trait. |
| 71—80 | **Too Lucky** : You've always had a knack for getting out of trouble. This sense of preternatural good fortune led to your inquiries into magic and the discovery of your own sorcerous powers. You gain access to the Fate's Favored faith trait. |
| 81—90 | **Unharmed** : At some point in your early life, you were exposed to something dangerous like a fall into stormy waters or a spell cast your way. But instead of dying, you survived entirely unscathed. This experience either first hinted at or confirmed that you were different, marking the first step on your path to sorcery. You gain access to the Unscathed magic trait. |
| 91—100 | **Wild Talent** : The magic in your blood was always as uncontrollable as it has powerful. You were forced to learn control at an early age, either out of fear that your powers might hurt someone or out of remorse once they had. This relentless vigilance and self-control gave you tremendous focus and arm you with strategic methods to redirect those wild energies coursing through you. You gain access to the Volatile Conduit magic trait. |

## Summoner

Most, if not all, spellcasters can call to otherworldly creatures for aid. And though many learn to call increasingly powerful minions to assist them, none boast the same connection to these outsiders as summoners do. A summoner is defined by the bond formed with the single creature that acts as his eidolon. Protectors, steeds, and links to other worlds, eidolons are lifelong companions for their mortal masters. The choice to tie oneself to an eidolon and the circumstances leading to that choice form the foundation of any summoner's character. Roll on the table below to determine what caused you to forge your otherworldly bond with your trusted companion.

[Summoner Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Abandoned** : At some point early on, you were abandoned. This sense of loss always made you feel as though something were missing. The discovery of your eidolon and your subsequent mutual bond fostered in you the sense of companionship you've always longed for. You gain access to the Greater Link magic trait. |
| 11—20 | **Caretaker** : You met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger. Wounded or lost, the creature crashed between worlds and ended up at your feet. In helping this panicked, otherworldly creature, you felt a link to it. You can still draw on the inspiration from that moment when dealing with others, outsider or not. You gain access to the Destined Diplomat social trait. |
| 21—30 | **Forced to Confront Your Own Limits** : The bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help. Your feeling of desperation and frustration at the limits of your own form attracted your eidolon—whether or not it was able to help you in that moment. This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. You gain access to the Desperate Speed magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **Imaginary Friends** : As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you. These whispers were actually the wandering thoughts of outsiders trying to make contact, knowing that someday you would have an affinity with their kind. By the time you learned to summon your eidolon and other outsiders, these whispered fragments had turned themselves into an understanding of the language of outsiders. You gain access to the Unintentional Linguist social trait. |
| 41—50 | **Monophobic** : You were always terrified of being alone when you were younger, so you surrounded yourself with others. But it was establishing this link to your eidolon that ultimately allowed you to overcome this debilitating fear. Now, even when your eidolon is not with you, you know it's never far away; conversely, when you have your true friend and companion with you, you are far better for it. You gain access to the Perpetual Companion faith trait. |
| 51—60 | **Outsider's Lineage** : You have the blood of outsiders in your veins. This lineage either laid dormant until your powers manifested or was a storied part of your family heritage. Regardless, your connection to the planes has always been potent. No matter what other subjects you studied, your understanding of planar matters has always seemed instinctive or innate rather than the product of memorization and study. You gain access to the Planar Savant faith trait. |
| 61—70 | **Pick On Someone Your Own Size** : When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were. You later realized that this support was the first trace of your eidolon trying to make contact with you. You can still draw on that power today, making your aura strong and your presence powerful. You gain access to the Twinned Presence magic trait. |
| 71—80 | **Raising Gone Wrong** : You lost someone important to you. Through means, luck, or simple pity, you had the chance to raise that person from the dead, but something went wrong with the spell and the raising did not occur… at least not as planned. Your lost friend or kin's soul bonded with a powerful outsider on the other side of the veil and returned to you as your eidolon. Possessed of some of the memories and experiences of the life you spent together, your companion feels a stronger devotion than even most others of its kind. You gain access to the Loyalty across Lifetimes faith trait. |
| 81—90 | **Saved by Another** : Someone or something saved you from great danger. It might have been a family member who saved you from a precipitous fall or adventurers who saved you from a marauding monster. Your sense of gratitude fostered a strong sense of protectiveness, particularly when defending your allies or your eidolon. You gain access to the Dedicated Defender combat trait. |
| 91—100 | **Stranger in Your Own Skin** : You have felt awkward and uncomfortable your entire life, as if you were born into a body that wasn't truly yours. Your quest to become what you've always felt you should be led you to your eidolon, in which you found what you see as your own idealized form. The link that you and your eidolon share allows you to escape some of the inherent limits of your form from time to time. You gain access to the Linked Surge magic trait. |

## Witch

Some witches make pacts for their power by choice. Many more discover it by accident or circumstance. Roll on the table below to determine which of the following events shaped your early life and sent you down the witch's path.

| --- | --- |

| 11—20 | **Desperate Accident** : You lived an ordinary life until one day catastrophe struck and you called out desperately to any power that would come to your aid. The entity that gave you this power might be benevolent or sinister in nature, but ever since you called it, the being remains close to you. You gain access to the Reckless combat trait. |
| 21—30 | **Forbidden Lore** : In your youth, there was something you fervently desired—perhaps love, wealth, or revenge. But no matter how hard you tried, you couldn't obtain that which you coveted. Only when you turned your eye to ancient tomes and ruins and experimented with strange powers beyond your comprehension were you able to get what you wanted. You gain access to the Dangerously Curious magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **Found Familiar** : When you were young, you happened upon a strange animal with whom you forged an instant bond.

| 41—50 | **Gifted** : You received your magical ability as a gift from a supernatural being, such as an angel, devil, god, ancient dragon, or powerful fey. This creature expects you to act on its behalf in exchange for the power it loaned you. You gain access to the Magical Knack magic trait. |
| 51—60 | **Inborn Power** : Many fey creatures are born with the innate ability to cast spells, and either because of having fey blood in your lineage or being born near fey lands you too were gifted this talent. You gain access to the Magical Lineage magic trait. |
| 61—70 | **Initiated** : When you came of age, a coven of witches initiated you into their circle because you showed great promise. After your initiation ritual, you changed on a fundamental level. You gain access to the Mentored social trait. |
| 71—80 | **Invocation** : When you reached adolescence, you wanted power and you wanted it immediately. You didn't have the patience or tolerance to endure endless years of boring theory and formal magical training, so you offered up your body and soul in an invocation to an entity that would grant your desire. You gain access to the Oathbound faith trait. |
| 81—90 | **Possessed** : For reasons you may never understand, an otherworldly entity took possession of you in your formative years. Since then, your mortal body has been the vessel for this mysterious power. You gain access to the Possessed magic trait. |
| 91—100 | **Unknown** : The circumstances by which you gained your powers are confusing, even to you. You may have received them when you stepped into a enchanted land or touched a strange artifact, or perhaps you simply awoke one day with them. You strive to find the meaning of your powers, as they drive your life in unforeseen directions. You gain access to the Seeker social trait. |

## Wizard

Perhaps no other class exemplifies the acquisition of power through sheer focus and determination as well as the wizard. Neither touched by divine purpose nor blessed with magic in their blood, wizards must spend their entire lives studying the same texts, tomes, scrolls, and recitations to master the magical arts. Such a craft can be self-taught or instilled through instruction, learned in an academy or at the fringes of the world, but it can be mastered only through the most rigorous and regimented of study. Roll on the table below to determine how you came to study wizardry, and how that study forever shaped you.

[Wizard Backgrounds]
| d% | Result |
| --- | --- |
| 01—10 | **Brains over Brawn** : You were bullied or excluded throughout your life because you lacked physical power and fighting prowess. To compensate, you turned to transmutation magic. Your practice and perseverance has granted you skill with spells of that school. You gain access to the Tenacious Shifting magic trait. |
| 11—20 | **Dangerous Intellect** : At a young age, those around you, whether family or friends, realized that your intellect was more than mere precociousness. As your sense of curiosity became dangerous, those responsible for you pushed you into studying magic in the hopes that you would find infinite puzzles to solve. You gain access to the Tireless Logic social trait. |
| 21—30 | **Fitting In** : You hail from a long line of sorcerers or from a community known for its natural affinity for magic. Your manifestation of wizardly talent, as opposed to blood-based sorcery, caused you to hide those talents at a young age, and then to disguise them as sorcery to the best of your ability later. You still retain some tricks from this early misdirection. You gain access to the Shrouded Casting magic trait. |
| 31—40 | **Gifted Pride** : Your affinity for magic has made you somewhat crass and arrogant, though some find your blunt disposition charming or worthy of respect. The air of superiority surrounding you is palpable and allows you to use you intellect to cow others at times when lesser individuals might barely get a word in. You gain access to the Bruising Intellect social trait. |
| 41—50 | **Mortality's Mirror** : Your childhood innocence ended the moment you realized that someday you would die. This revelation may have come to you at the deathbed of a beloved relative, during a bloody siege against your homeland, or via some other eye-opening event. You have spent the rest of your life trying to master magic in order to change this most universal fate from stealing your last breaths away. You now have a keen eye for the magic of death and for discerning answers to ancient riddles. You gain access to the Greater Purpose magic trait. |
| 51—60 | **Righting a Wrong** : In your youth, you witnessed an event that changed the fate of many or of a tragic few, such as a natural disaster (like a flood, hurricane, or fire) or simply a friend's unfortunate accident during a childish game. You were burdened by the knowledge that magic— perhaps even a spell as simple as _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_ **—** could have changed the course of lives. You've dedicated yourself to magic in an effort to make sure that you are never subject to the capricious whims of fate again. You gain access to the Desperate Resolve magic trait. |
| 61—70 | **Storied Lineage** : Your family name is synonymous with wizardry of the highest caliber. Magic was your destined path before you were even born, and both your family and those who know of your lineage have supported this notion your entire life, granting you an unwavering confidence in your talents. While the pursuit of arcane mastery is never easy, you are driven to live up to the expectations set forth for you. You gain access to the Resilient Caster magic trait. |
| 71—80 | **The Way Things Work** : Magic came alive the first time you held a magic item. The notion of extraordinary magic resting within something as seemingly ordinary as a ring, amulet, or stoppered vial changed the way you viewed the world, and ever since you've possessed a sense of curiosity and awe for all magic items. You gain access to the Magic Crafter magic trait and the Eldritch Researcher story feat. |
| 81—90 | **Unpaid Debt** : Someone saved your life at great cost. Whether through healing magic or basic heroism, your savior gave her life that you might live. Striving to repay this debt has led you to study magic, the only thing capable of making enough of a difference in the world to make you feel that you have earned the gift given to you. This sense of purpose has engendered an unshakable resolve in you. You gain access to the Principled faith trait. |
| 91—100 | **Unquenchable Hunger for Knowledge** : For most wizards, magic is an end to which all studies strive, but not for you. For you, magic is a means to an end—and that end is knowledge. Your desire to know all of the secrets of the world requires the ability to cross continents in a blink, ride the winds, breathe water like a fish, and survive any kind of trap. Your unquenching quest for knowledge has made you ever ready for danger. You gain access to the Eldritch Delver magic trait. |

## Influential Associates

Influential associates are people who had (or continue to have) a strong influence upon your development. They are archetypes and templates for NPCs that you can customize to fit your background. Roll on the table below to determine an associate or ally who had a major influence on your life. Then flesh out the details to show how this person fits within your story.

| 06—10 | **The Pariah** : You met a disgraced exile, and found in his words and attitudes something that spoke to you.

You gain access to the Suspicious social trait. |
| 11—15 | **The Confidante** : There was a person in your life to whom you could tell anything. She knows your deepest secrets and your emotional weaknesses and vulnerabilities just as you know hers.

You gain access to the Trustworthy social trait. |
| 16—20 | **The Mentor** : You had a mentor who taught you everything worth knowing about life. This could have been the person who taught you the heroic abilities you possess, or simply a kindred spirit who helped form your worldview. You gain access to the Mentored social trait. |
| 21—25 | **The Mercenary** : With this person, there was always a cost. No deed was done making a trade for something of equal or greater value.

You gain access to the Mercenary social trait. |
| 26—30 | **The Lover** : You had a romantic connection in your adolescent years, and this person deeply influenced your personality.

You gain access to the Charming social trait and the True Love story feat. Roll a d12 instead of a d20 on the Romantic Relationships table. |
| 31—35 | **The Fool** : One of your close associates was a clown who mocked propriety and custom, instead engaging in wild and somewhat random actions from time to time. After a while, you learned that there was simple wisdom to this foolery—a careless worldview that taught you how to cast off concern. You gain access to the Unpredictable social trait. |
| 36—40 | **The Liege Lord** : You became close with someone you were bound to serve, be it a minor lord or lady, master (in the case of a slave), prince or princess, king or queen.

As a result, you're used to dealing with and being close to power, and your name is known among the ranks of the privileged. You gain access to the Influence social trait. |
| 41—45 | **The Relative** : There is a relative you were especially close to. To you, this person was the meaning of family.

You gain access to the Natural-Born Leader social trait. |
| 51—55 | **The Academic** : One of your associates had such a lust for knowledge that she could never be satisfied with simple answers or obvious solutions.

You gain access to the Mathematical [Prodigy](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.md#prodigy) magic trait. |
| 56—60 | **The Criminal** : One of your associates committed crimes regularly. He regaled you with many stories of daring robberies and break-ins—and perhaps even murders. You learned most of what you know of the criminal element from him, and he trusted you as a friend. You gain access to the Canter social trait. |
| 61—65 | **The Seer** : You were close to a person who claimed to see the future—perhaps an oracle, seer, prophet, or merely some festival charlatan. Whether they're true or a trick, you've seen visions of distant places and of times that may come to pass. The seer's influence either made you into an optimist with a drive to change the future or a fatalist resigned to accept it. You gain access to the Scholar of the Great Beyond faith trait. |
| 66—70 | **The Mystic** : You were especially close to a holy person in your community who fundamentally changed your life by opening your eyes to the incredible powers that exist beyond the natural world.

| 71—75 | **The Dead One** : One of your greatest influences was a sentient undead creature, such as a ghost, lich, grave knight, wraith, or vampire.

You gain access to the Possessed magic trait and the Damned story feat. |
| 81—85 | **The Wanderer** : You knew someone who traveled from place to place with the changing of the wind, such as a minstrel, convict, merchant, outcast, soldier, or sailor.

| 96—100 | **Well-Connected Friend** : In your circle of disparate associates, there was someone everyone knew.

Through this connection, you continue to meet and associate with a wide variety of people in every walk of life. You gain access to the Well-Informed halfling race trait (which you may take regardless of your race). |

## Step 3—Moral Conflicts, Relationships, and Drawbacks 

With age come the events and relationships that leave a definitive mark on your personality. You face and resolve moral challenges, your romantic relationships blossom and sometimes wilt, you meet those who become adventuring companions, and you face your vulnerabilities either in the form of personal challenges or adversaries who represent some side of yourself.

To determine a major conflict you had in the past, as well as your romantic relationships and personality drawbacks, do the following:

1. Roll on the tables below to determine a major conflict you had, whom you had the conflict with, the motivation for the conflict, and how you resolved it. Then adjust your alignment using the alignment track.

2. Choose the deity or religious philosophy you follow, which grants access to a trait.

3. Roll on the Romantic Relationships table to determine what your romantic relationships have been like.

4. Roll on the Relationship with a Fellow Adventurer table, likely multiple times, to determine the various relationships with your fellow adventurers.

5. Roll on the Character Drawback table to determine your character's drawbacks. You can take this drawback to gain another trait.

### Major Conflict and Alignment

The following tables provide a means of determining your alignment by introducing a pivotal moral conflict in your early life—one moment during your ethical development that determined the kind of person you grew up to be.

When determining your conflict, you accumulate a number of Conflict Points (CP). The conflict and your motivation are each worth a number of CP; you can adjust the number of CP based on the resolution of the conflict. When you determine the total CP, you then must add your CP on one alignment track or distribute the points on both of them—the good-evil track and the lawful-chaotic track, as detailed on the Determining Alignment table. Position 1 on the track represents the first CP added. Each point on the first track represents you turning away from what is good and heading down a path of evil. Each point on the second track represents a disregard for law as you grow more chaotic. This determines how the conflict ultimately affected your alignment and to what extent. If you are using the rules for changing your alignment, this also determines your starting place on the alignment track. If you start with 0 CP on either track, assume you start at 1 on the track for those rules.

### Conflicts

Begin by rolling on the Conflicts table. This table lists 20 conflicts, ranging from minor indiscretions to grievous sins. The type of die you roll on this table is based on the needs of the campaign as well as your character's starting class. First, consult with your GM; If you can play any alignment in the campaign, roll a d20. If your campaign allows only nonevil characters, roll a d12. If you are playing a paladin or some other character who must be good, roll a d6. Once you are done, proceed to Conflict Subject table and to the tables and sections subsequent to it.

[Conflicts]
| d20 | Result | CP |

### Conflict Motivation

To determine the source of your motivation for the conflict, roll on the table below. If the campaign allows the full spectrum of alignments, roll a d10 on this table. If the campaign allows only nonevil alignments, roll a d8. If you're a paladin, roll a d4. The motivation affects the CP gained from the conflict.

[Motivation]

| 8 | Hatred or Malice | 4 |
| 9 | Pleasure | 5 |
| 10 | Amusement or Entertainment | 5 |

### Resolution

Once you determine the nature and CP for the event, the next step is to determine the resolution. Instead of rolling for the conflict's resolution, you choose how you dealt with it, and your choice can affect the number of CP the conflict is worth. In games that do not allow evil characters, you cannot take a resolution that would adjust your character to an evil alignment.

**Regret and Penance (—3 CP)** : Not only do you regret your action, but you have publicly admitted to it and did your best to make amends for the wrongdoing. Most know of the conflict's details and those who don't can easily find them out if they know where to look or whom to ask.

**Sincere Regret (—2 CP)** : Though you feel sincere regret for the event and its memory affects your behavior, it's still a secret. Only your trusted companions know of the conflict, and they have promised a degree of discretion.

**Secret Regret (—1 CP)** : You regret the conflict, but go to great lengths to keep it secret and try desperately to forget it ever happened. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement in the conflict.

**Mixed Feelings (0 CP)** : Sometimes you regret the conflict, but other times you feel as if you didn't have a choice in the matter or that you made the right decision. Most of the time, you just avoid thinking about the conflict. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement.

**Denial (+1 CP)** : You feel little if any regret, and deny the event mostly so others won't judge you. Few if any know of your part in the conflict, and your constant denials are meant to keep it that way.

**No Guilt (+2 CP)** : Either guilt is for the weak, or you know you made the right decision. You might not openly brag about your part in the conflict, but you don't deny it when confronted either.

**You Enjoyed It (+3 CP)** : Those who cling to petty morals have no understanding of what true freedom and power is. The fact is, you enjoyed your part in the conflict and would do it all over again if the opportunity presented itself. Many people know of your misdeed, and they also realize your complete lack of remorse.

### Deity and Religious Philosophy

### Romantic Relationships

Roll on the table below to determine the kinds of romantic relationships you have had in the past. You might have a background that requires you to roll a d12 on this table instead of a d20.

| 19—20 | **No Experience** : You have never experienced any kind of romantic connection whatsoever. |

### Relationship with Fellow Adventurers

This table is best used by the adventuring party as a whole to determine starting relationships between the characters. One player begins the process by choosing someone in the group and rolling to learn the relationship between her and the second character. Then the next player chooses a different character and rolls to determine their relationship, and so on, until finally the last player rolls to determine his relationship with the first character. It is easiest to do this sitting around a table, with each player passing the dice clockwise until the dice have completed a full turn around the table.

You can also use this table free-form if you wish, rolling for your relationship for as many or as few of the other characters as you care to define; however, the first method guarantees that every character has connections to two other characters to improve group cohesion.

If you end up with a result that makes no sense or isn't possible, reroll or just chose another option.

[Relationship with Fellow Adventurers]

| 01—05 | Family or close as family—close friends, close/distant relatives, relatives by marriage/adoption |

### Character Drawback

Character drawbacks are emotional weak points—chinks your armor. A drawback gives you a small mechanical penalty and a roleplaying hook. Drawbacks also serve as loopholes in the alignment system. When roleplaying your drawback, you might act well outside the bounds of your alignment within certain situations. Each of the following grants a drawback you may choose to take. If you take a drawback option, you may take three traits you have access to instead of two. Roll on the following table to determine your character's drawback.

Discuss with the GM the details of this drawback, such as what the attachment is or who the person involved might be.

[Character Drawback]

| 71—75 | **Self-Doubt** : No matter what you do, it's never good enough. You cannot help but see in your victories many little defeats and failures.

| 91—95 | **Worldview** : In your eyes, your moral philosophy—your alignment—is the only correct and true way of the world. Perhaps you gently pity, argue with, or brawl with those misguided souls who don't see the world your way or by your light of reason. You gain access to the Provincial drawback. |
| 96—100 | **Youth** : You reflect upon your youth as a golden time, one ever present in your mind and that refuses to fade into the background.
