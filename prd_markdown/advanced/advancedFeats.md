# Feats

Feats represent a special trick or ability a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her birth. They grant characters abilities others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets the prerequisites. The feats in this book expand upon those in the _Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, _including a host of new combat feats and metamagic feats. In addition, this chapter also introduces teamwork feats, which function only when two characters with the same feat work together.

# Types of Feats

While most of the feats presented here are general, and have no special rules governing them, some feats have a category associated with them that involves special rules. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.

## Combat Feats

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming they meet the prerequisites.

## Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting them new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.

## Teamwork Feats

Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats.

# Feat Descriptions

Feats are summarized on the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' description for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

**Feat Name** : The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.

**Prerequisite** : A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.

**Benefit** : What a feat enables the character (âyouâ in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

**Normal** : What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

**Special** : Additional unusual facts about the feat.

## Additional Traits

You have more traits than normal.

## Allied Spellcaster (Teamwork)

With the aid of an ally, you are skilled at piercing the protections of other creatures with your spells.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +2 competence bonus on level checks made to overcome spell resistance. If your ally has the same spell prepared (or known with a slot available if they are spontaneous spellcasters), this bonus increases to +4 and you receive a +1 bonus to the caster level for all level-dependent variables, such as duration, range, and effect.

## Arcane Blast

You can convert any spell into an attack.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As a standard action, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and transform it into a ray, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This attack deals 2d6 points of damage plus an additional 1d6 points of damage for every level of the spell or spell slot you sacrificed. 0-level spells may not be sacrificed in this manner.

## Arcane Shield

You can convert any spell into a defense.

**Prerequisites:** Arcane spellcaster, caster level 10th.

**Benefit:** As a immediate action, you can sacrifice a prepared spell or unused spell slot of 1st level or higher and gain a deflection bonus to AC equal to the level of the spell or spell slot you sacrificed for 1 round. 0-level spells may not be sacrificed in this manner.

## Arcane Talent

Magic is in your blood, and at your fingertips.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 10; elf, half-elf, or gnome.

**Benefit:** Choose a 0-level spell from the sorcerer/wizard spell list. You can cast this spell three times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level is equal to your character level. The save DC is 10 + your Charisma modifier.

## Aspect of the Beast

Whether by magic or a curse of your blood, some part of you is more beast than man.

**Prerequisite:** wild shape class feature, see Special.

**Benefit:** Your bestial nature manifests itself in one of the following ways. You choose the manifestation when you choose the feat, and then you cannot change it.

_Night Senses (Ex)_: If your base race has normal vision, you gain low-light vision. If your base race has low-light vision, you gain darkvision out to a range of 30 feet. If your base race has darkvision, the range of your darkvision increases by 30 feet.

_Claws of the Beast (Ex)_: You grow a pair of claws. These claws are primary attacks that deal 1d4 points of damage (1d3 if you are Small).

_Predator's Leap (Ex)_: You can make a running jump without needing to run 10 feet before you jump.

_Wild Instinct (Ex)_: You gain a +2 bonus on initiative checks and a +2 bonus on [Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) skill checks.

**Special:** A character that has contracted lycanthropy can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites. A ranger who selects the natural weapon combat style can take this feat without having to meet the prerequisites (even if he does not select Aspect of the Beast as a bonus feat).

## Bashing Finish (Combat)

You follow a powerful blow from your weapon with an opportunistic bash from your shield.

**Prerequisites:** [Improved Shield Bash](../feats.html#_improved-shield-bash), [Shield Master](../feats.html#_shield-master), [Two-Weapon Fighting](../feats.html#_two-weapon-fighting), base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee weapon, you can make a shield bash attack against the same target using the same bonus as a free action.

## Bloody Assault (Combat)

Sacrificing accuracy, you can inflict bloody wounds that are slow to heal.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a –5 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to inflict 1d4 points of bleed damage with your weapon melee attacks, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the weapon. A creature continues to take bleed damage every round at the start of its turn. Bleed damage can be stopped by a DC 15 [Heal](../skills/heal.html#_heal) check or through any magical healing. Bleed damage from this feat does not stack with itself. You must choose to use this feat before making the attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn (although the bleeding lasts until healed, as normal).

## Bodyguard (Combat)

Your swift strikes ward off enemies attacking nearby allies.

**Prerequisite:** [Combat Reflexes](../feats.html#_combat-reflexes).

**Benefit:** When an adjacent ally is attacked, you may use an attack of opportunity to attempt the aid another action to improve your ally's AC. You may not use the aid another action to improve your ally's attack roll with this attack.

**Normal:** Aid another is a standard action.

## Bouncing Spell (Metamagic)

You can direct a failed spell against a different target.

**Benefit:** Whenever a bouncing spell targeting a single creature has no effect on its intended target (whether due to spell resistance or a successful saving throw) you may, as a swift action, redirect it to target another eligible creature within range. The redirected spell behaves in all ways as if its new target were the original target for the spell. Spells that affect a target in any way (including a lesser effect from a successful saving throw) may not be redirected in this manner. A bouncing spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

## Breadth of Experience

Although still young for your kind, you have a lifetime of knowledge and training.

**Prerequisites:** Dwarf, elf, or gnome; 100+ years old.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on all [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) and [Profession](../skills/profession.html#_profession) skill checks, and can make checks with those skills untrained.

## Bull Rush Strike (Combat)

Your critical hits can push back your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Improved Bull Rush](../feats.html#_improved-bull-rush), [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can push your opponent back, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may push your opponent back as if from the bull rush combat maneuver. You do not need to move with the target if successful. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a bull rush combat maneuver to bull rush an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.

## Charge Through (Combat)

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to daze a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become dazed for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell.

**Benefit:** Targets affected by a disruptive spell must make concentration checks when using spells or spell-like abilities (DC equals the save DC of the disruptive spell plus the level of the spell being cast) for 1 round.

Your allies assist you in avoiding certain attacks.

You can share spells with those you have a magical connection with.

**Benefit:** Any non-instantaneous spell (but not any spell-like ability) you cast on yourself can also affect a creature bonded to you (such as an animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or special mount). The creature must be within 5 feet of you at the time of casting to receive the benefit. The spell's duration is halved between you and your bonded creature (for example, a spell with a duration of 1 hour has a duration of 30 minutes for both you and your bonded creature).

If the spell or effect has a duration other than instantaneous, it stops affecting the creature if it moves farther than 5 feet away from you. It does not affect the creature again if it returns before the duration expires.

You may share spells in this fashion even if the spells normally do not affect creatures of that type.

This feat only applies to animal companions, eidolons, familiars, or special mounts gained through a class feature.

## Improved Sidestep (Combat)

You are adept at sidestepping your opponent's melee attacks without compromising your mobility.

Your spells can go beyond several normal limitations.

**Benefit:** An intensified spell increases the maximum number of damage dice by 5 levels. You must actually have sufficient caster levels to surpass the maximum in order to benefit from this feat. No other variables of the spell are affected, and spells that inflict damage that is not modified by caster level are not affected by this feat. An intensified spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

## In Harm's Way (Combat)

You put yourself in danger's path to save your allies.

**Prerequisite:** Bodyguard.

**Benefit:** While using the aid another action to improve an adjacent ally's AC, you can intercept a successful attack against that ally as an immediate action, taking full damage from that attack and any associated effects (bleed, poison, etc.).

## Lingering Spell (Metamagic)

You spell clings to existence, slowly fading from the world.

**Benefit:** You may cause an instantaneous spell that affects an area to persist until the beginning of your next turn. Those already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering spell with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet.

A lingering spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

## Lookout (Combat, Teamwork)

Your allies help you avoid being surprised.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you may act in the surprise round as long as your ally would normally be able to act in the surprise round. If you would normally be denied the ability to act in the surprise round, your initiative is equal to your initiative roll or the roll of your ally –1, whichever is lower. If both you and your ally would be able to act in the surprise round without the aid of this feat, you may take both a standard and a move action (or a full-round action) during the surprise round.

## Major Spell Expertise

You can cast a single low-level spell as a spell-like ability.

**Prerequisites:** Minor Spell Expertise, ability to cast 9th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one spell that you know of 5th level or lower. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell.

## Master Alchemist

Your mastery of alchemy is nearly supernatural.

**Prerequisite:** [Craft](../skills/craft.html#_craft) (alchemy) 5 ranks.

**Benefit:** You receive a +2 bonus on [Craft](../skills/craft.html#_craft) (alchemy) checks, and you may create mundane alchemical items much more quickly than normal. When making poisons, you can create a number of doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one time. These additional doses do not increase the time required, but they do increase the raw material cost.

In addition, whenever you make alchemical items or poisons using [Craft](../skills/craft.html#_craft) (alchemy), use the item's gp value as its sp value when determining your progress (do not multiply the item's gp cost by 10 to determine its sp cost).

## Merciful Spell (Metamagic)

Your damaging spells subdue rather than kill.

**Benefit:** You can alter spells that inflict damage to inflict nonlethal damage instead. Spells that inflict damage of a particular type (such as fire) inflict nonlethal damage of that same type. A merciful spell does not use up a higher-level spell slot than the spell's actual level.

## Minor Spell Expertise

You are able to cast a 1st-level spell as a spell-like ability.

**Prerequisite:** Ability to cast 4th-level spells.

**Benefit:** Choose one 1st-level spell that you know. You may cast that spell twice per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this spell-like ability is equal to your caster level in the class from whose spell list the spell is taken. The spell-like ability's save DC is Charisma-based. If the spell has an expensive focus or material component, it may not be chosen for this feat. You cannot apply metamagic feats to this spell.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new spell.

## Missile Shield (Combat)

You are skilled at deflecting ranged attacks with your shield.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Shield Focus](../feats.html#_shield-focus).

**Benefit:** You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat.

You must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed.

## Mounted Shield (Combat)

Your defensive tactics defend both you and your mount.

**Prerequisites:** [Mounted Combat](../feats.html#_mounted-combat), [Shield Focus](../feats.html#_shield-focus).

**Benefit:** You may add your base shield bonus (including the bonus from [Shield Focus](../feats.html#_shield-focus) but not including enhancement bonuses) to your mount's AC.

## Mounted Skirmisher (Combat)

You are adept at attacking from upon a swift moving steed.

**Prerequisites:** [Ride](../skills/ride.html#_ride) rank 14, [Mounted Combat](../feats.html#_mounted-combat), Trick Riding.

## Outflank (Combat, Teamwork)

You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4. In addition, whenever you score a critical hit against the flanked creature, it provokes an attack of opportunity from your ally.

## Paired Opportunists (Combat, Teamwork)

You know how to make an enemy pay for lax defenses.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both threaten. Enemies that provoke attacks of opportunity from your ally also provoke attacks of opportunity from you so long as you threaten them (even if the situation or an ability would normally deny you the attack of opportunity). This does not allow you to take more than one attack of opportunity against a creature for a given action.

## Parry Spell

You can throw an enemy spell back at its caster.

**Prerequisites:** [Spellcraft](../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft) 15 ranks, [Improved Counterspell](../feats.html#_improved-counterspell) .

## Pass For Human

You're easily mistaken for a human rather than a member of your own race.

**Prerequisite:** Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special).

**Benefit:** You receive a +10 bonus on [Disguise](../skills/disguise.html#_disguise) checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your [Disguise](../skills/disguise.html#_disguise) check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.

**Special:** A halfling may take this feat, but must have the Childlike feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.

## Perfect Strike (Combat)

When wielding a monk weapon, your attacks can be extremely precise.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, Wis 13, [Improved Unarmed Strike](../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike), base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A weapon master monk or zen archer monk receives Perfect Strike as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt an perfect strike attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

## Persistent Spell (Metamagic)

You can modify a spell to become more tenacious when its targets resist its effect.

**Benefit:** Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.

## Point Blank Master (Combat)

You are adept at firing ranged weapons in close quarters.

**Prerequisite:** [Weapon Specialization](../feats.html#_weapon-specialization) with selected ranged weapon.

**Benefit:** Choose one type of ranged weapon. You do not provoke attacks of opportunity when firing the selected weapon while threatened.

**Normal:** Using a ranged weapon while you are threatened provokes attacks of opportunity.

**Special:** Starting at 6th level, a ranger with the archery combat style may select Point Blank Master as a combat style feat, but he must have [Weapon Focus](../feats.html#_weapon-focus) instead of [Weapon Specialization](../feats.html#_weapon-specialization) in the selected weapon.

## Practiced Tactician

With only a few quick gestures and commands, you can direct others in combat.

**Prerequisite:** Tactician class feature.

**Benefit:** You can use your tactician ability to grant allies a teamwork feat one additional time per day.

**Special:** You can gain Practiced Tactician multiple times. Its effects stack.

## Precise Strike (Combat, Teamwork)

You are skilled at striking where it counts, as long as an ally distracts your foe.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same the creature, you deal an additional 1d6 points of precision damage with each successful melee attack. This bonus damage stacks with other sources of precision damage, such as sneak attack. This bonus damage is not multiplied on a critical hit.

## Preferred Spell

You find it very easy to cast one particular spell.

**Prerequisites:** [Spellcraft](../skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft) 5 ranks, [Heighten Spell](../feats.html#_heighten-spell).

**Benefit:** Choose one spell which you have the ability to cast. You can cast that spell spontaneously by sacrificing a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different spell.

## Punishing Kick (Combat)

Your kicks are so powerful you use them to push or knock back your foes.

**Prerequisites:** Con 13, Wis 13, [Improved Unarmed Strike](../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike), base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals damage normally and you can choose to push your target 5 feet or attempt to knock them prone. If you decide to push the target, it is moved 5 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. If you decide to attempt to knock the target prone, the target receives a Fortitude saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier to avoid the effect. You may attempt a punishing kick attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A hungry ghost monk receives Punishing Kick as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a punishing kick attack a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

## Pushing Assault (Combat)

A strike made with a two-handed weapon can push a similar sized opponent backward.

**Prerequisites:** Str 15, [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you hit a creature your size or smaller with a two-handed weapon attack modified by the [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack) feat, you can choose to push the target 5 feet directly away from you instead of dealing the extra damage from [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack). If you score a critical hit, you can instead push the target 10 feet directly away from you. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunities, and the target must end this move in a safe space it can stand in. You choose which effect to apply after the attack roll has been made, but before the damage is rolled.

## Racial Heritage

The blood of a non-human ancestor flows in your veins.

**Prerequisite:** Human.

**Benefit:** Choose another humanoid race. You count as both human and that race for any effects related to race. For example, if you choose dwarf, you are considered both a human and a dwarf for the purpose of taking traits, feats, how spells and magic items affect you, and so on.

## Raging Vitality

While raging, you are full of vigor and health.

**Prerequisites:** Con 15, rage class feature.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are raging, the morale bonus to your Constitution increases by +2. Your rage does not end if you become unconscious. While unconscious you must still expend rounds of rage per day each round.

## Ray Shield (Combat)

You can even deflect rays with your shield.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 15, Missile Shield, [Spellbreaker](../feats.html#_spellbreaker).

**Benefit:** You must be using a light, heavy, or tower shield to use this feat. Once per round when you would normally be hit with a ranged touch attack (including rays and similar magical effects), you may deflect it so that you take no damage from it. Your shield suffers the full effects of the spell or effect, if applicable.

## Razortusk

Your powerful jaws and steely teeth are deadly enough to give you a bite attack.

**Prerequisite:** Half-orc.

**Benefit:** You can make a bite attack for 1d4 points of damage, plus your Strength modifier. You're considered proficient in this attack and can apply feats or effects appropriate to natural attacks to it. If used as part of a full attack action, the bite is considered a secondary attack and is made at your full base attack bonus –5, and adds half your Strength modifier to damage.

## Reach Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells go farther than normal.

**Benefit:** You can alter a spell with a range of touch, close, or medium to increase its range to a higher range category, using the following order: touch, close, medium, and long. A reach spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level for each increase in range category. For example, a spell with a range of touch increased to long range uses up a spell slot three levels higher. Spells modified by this feat that require melee touch attacks instead require ranged touch attacks.

Spells that do not have a range of touch, close, or medium do not benefit from this feat.

## Rending Claws (Combat)

Your claw attacks do greater harm to your enemy.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, two claw natural weapon attacks, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you hit a creature with two claw attacks in the same turn, the second claw attack deals an additional 1d6 points of damage. This damage is precision damage and is not multiplied on a critical hit. You can use this feat once per round.

## Repositioning Strike (Combat)

Your critical hits can move your foes where you wish.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise](../feats.html#_combat-expertise), [Improved Trip](../feats.html#_improved-trip), base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can move your opponent, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may move your opponent as if from the reposition combat maneuver. This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a reposition combat maneuver to reposition an opponent.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.

## Saving Shield (Combat)

You deflect attacks that could mean your ally's death.

**Prerequisite:** [Shield Proficiency](../feats.html#_shield-proficiency).

**Benefits** : Whenever an adjacent ally is the target of an attack, you can, as an immediate action, grant that adjacent ally a +2 shield bonus to AC. You must be wielding a light shield, heavy shield, or tower shield to use this feat.

**Benefit:** When casting a selective spell with an area effect and a duration of instantaneous, you can choose a number of targets in the area equal to the ability score modifier used to determine bonus spells of the same type (Charisma for bards, oracles, paladins, sorcerers, and summoners; Intelligence for witches and wizards; Wisdom for clerics, druids, inquisitors, and rangers). These targets are excluded from the effects of your spell. A selective spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not have an area of effect do not benefit from this feat.

You accurately strike even those you cannot clearly see.

**Prerequisite:** Base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can deal precision damage, such as sneak attack damage, against targets with concealment (but not total concealment).

## Shared Insight

**Prerequisites:** Wis 13, half-elf.

**Benefit:** As a move action, you can grant all friendly creatures within 30 feet who can see or hear you a +2 bonus on [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) checks for a number of rounds equal to your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1 round).

## Sharp Senses

Your senses are especially sharp, even for your kind.

**Prerequisite:** Keen senses racial trait.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 racial bonus on [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) skill checks. This replaces the normal bonus from the keen senses racial trait.

**Normal:** The keen senses trait normally grants a +2 racial bonus on [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) skill checks.

## Shield of Swings (Combat)

A wild frenzy of attacks serves to bolster your defenses.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** When you take a full-attack action while wielding a two-handed weapon, you can choose to reduce the damage by 1/2 to gain a +4 shield bonus to AC and CMD until the beginning of your next turn. The reduction in damage applies until the beginning of your next turn.

You have mastered the use of one type of shield.

In addition, you may add your base shield bonus (including the bonus from [Shield Focus](../feats.html#_shield-focus) but not including enhancement bonuses) to your CMD.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of shield.

## Shield Wall (Combat, Teamwork)

You form a unified defense with those around you.

**Prerequisite:** [Shield Proficiency](../feats.html#_shield-proficiency).

**Benefit:** Whenever you are wielding a shield and are adjacent to an ally wielding a shield who also has this feat, the AC bonus from your shield increases, depending on the shield wielded by your ally. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, your shield bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, your shield bonus increases by +2. You keep these bonuses even if your ally loses his shield bonus due to making a shield bash attack. If an adjacent ally with this feat uses a tower shield to grant total cover, you also benefit if an attack targeting you passes through the edge of the shield (_Core Rulebook _153).

## Shielded Caster (Teamwork)

Your allies cover you while you cast complicated spells.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 competence bonus on concentration checks. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, this bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, this bonus increases by +2. Finally, if an enemy threatening you and your ally has the [Disruptive](../feats.html#_disruptive) feat, or another ability that increases the DC of concentration checks, the amount of the increase is halved.

## Sickening Spell (Metamagic)

You can sicken creatures with your spells.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

## Sidestep (Combat)

You can reposition yourself after a foe's missed swing.

**Prerequisites:** Dex 13, [Dodge](../feats.html#_dodge), [Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility).

**Benefit:** Whenever an opponent misses you with a melee attack, you may move 5 feet as an immediate action so long as you remain within that opponent's threatened area. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If you take this step, you cannot take a 5-foot step during your next turn. If you take an action to move during your next turn, subtract 5 feet from your total movement.

## Smash (Combat)

You overcome obstacles by breaking them.

**Prerequisites:** [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), half-orc.

**Benefit:** When you attack an inanimate, unattended object, you ignore the first 5 points of its hardness. You also receive a +5 bonus on Strength checks made to knock down or break open doors.

**Special:** The benefits of this feat do not apply to sunder attempts or attacks against constructs, only attacks on inanimate, unattended objects.

## Smell Fear

You can catch the sour scent of fear on the wind.

**Prerequisites:** Keen Scent, half-orc or orc.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 bonus on [Perception](../skills/perception.html#_perception) checks to detect creatures with the shaken, frightened, or panicked conditions using scent.

You can clear the way to continue using your bow.

**Prerequisites:** [Rapid Shot](../feats.html#_rapid-shot), elf.

**Benefit:** When adjacent to an opponent and making a full-attack action with a longbow or shortbow (including composite bows), you may choose to make a melee attack against that opponent with a drawn arrow rather than firing it. If the attack hits—whether or not it does damage—your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from [Rapid Shot](../feats.html#_rapid-shot), and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a –2 penalty.

**Benefit:** When using the [Step Up](../feats.html#_step-up) or Following Step feats to follow an adjacent foe, you may also make a single melee attack against that foe at your highest base attack bonus.

**Normal:** You can usually only take one standard action and one 5-foot step each round.

## Stone-Faced

Rocks show more expression than you.

**Prerequisite:** Dwarf.

**Benefit:** You receive a +4 bonus on [Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff) checks to lie or conceal your feelings or true motives, but not to feint in combat or deliver secret messages.

Whenever you summon your eidolon, it is more powerful for a brief period of time.

**Prerequisite:** Eidolon class feature.

Your critical hits can sunder your foes' weapons.

**Prerequisites:** Str 13, [Improved Sunder](../feats.html#_improved-sunder), [Power Attack](../feats.html#_power-attack), base attack bonus +9.

**Benefit:** Whenever you score a critical hit with a melee attack, you can sunder your opponent's weapon, in addition to the normal damage dealt by the attack. If your confirmation roll exceeds your opponent's CMD, you may deal damage to your opponent's weapon as if from the sunder combat maneuver (roll normal damage to the weapon separately). This does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Normal:** You must perform a sunder combat maneuver to sunder an opponent's weapon.

**Special:** You can only apply the effects of one of the following feats to a given critical hit: Bull Rush Strike, Disarming Strike, Repositioning Strike, Sundering Strike, or Tripping Strike. You may choose to use this feat after you make your confirmation roll.

You are skilled at changing places with your ally during a chaotic melee.

**Benefit:** Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you can move into your ally's square as part of normal movement. At the same time, your ally moves into your previous space as an immediate action. Both you and your ally must be willing and able to move to take advantage of this feat. Your ally must be the same size as you to utilize this feat. Your ally does not provoke an attack of opportunity from this movement, but you provoke as normal. This movement does not count against your ally's movement on his next turn.

## Swift Aid (Combat)

With a quick but harmless swipe, you can aid an ally's assault.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise](../feats.html#_combat-expertise), base attack bonus +6.

**Normal:** Aid another is a standard action.

## Taunt

You may be small, but your remarks cut others down to size.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, Small size or smaller.

**Benefit:** You can demoralize opponents using [Bluff](../skills/bluff.html#_bluff) rather than [Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate) (see the [Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate) skill description for details) and take no skill check penalty for being smaller than your target.

## Tenacious Transmutation

Your mastery of the magic of changing makes your transmutations more durable.

**Prerequisite:** [Spell Focus](../feats.html#_spell-focus) (transmutation).

**Benefit:** The DC of caster level checks to dispel or remove your transmutations increases by 2; even if the spell is negated, its effects persist for 1 additional round before dissipating.

## Thundering Spell (Metamagic)

You can conjure your spells into existence with blaring thunder or fearful shrieks, deafening creatures damaged by their effects.

**Benefit:** You can modify a spell to deafen a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, it becomes deafened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A thundering spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.

## Touch of Serenity (Combat)

With a single touch you can reduce the threat of even the most savage of foes.

**Prerequisites:** Wis 18, [Improved Unarmed Strike](../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike), base attack bonus +8.

**Benefit:** You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). On a successful hit, the attack deals no damage and bestows no other effect or condition, but the target cannot cast spells or attack (including attacks of opportunity and attacks as immediate actions) for 1 round unless it succeeds on a Will saving throw with a DC of 10 + 1/2 your character level + your Wisdom modifier. You may attempt a touch of serenity once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.

**Special:** A monk of the lotus receives Touch of Serenity as a bonus feat at 1st level, even if he does not meet the prerequisites. A monk may attempt a touch of serenity a number of times per day equal to his monk level, plus one more time per day for every four levels he has in classes other than monk.

The force intrinsic to your critical hits can knock your foes down.

**Prerequisites:** Int 13, [Combat Expertise](../feats.html#_combat-expertise), [Improved Trip](../feats.html#_improved-trip), base attack bonus +9.

In addition, you gain a +2 dodge bonus to Armor Class against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a larger opponent's threatened area (this stacks with the +4 bonus provided by [Mobility](../feats.html#_mobility), for a total bonus of +6).

## Vermin Heart

You have a special bond with things that creep, crawl, skitter, and sting.

**Prerequisite:** Wild empathy class feature.

**Benefit:** You may target vermin with spells and special abilities that only affect animals (although they are still affected by spells targeting vermin as well). You may use wild empathy to influence vermin as easily as you influence animals.

## War Singer

Your songs draw upon the savage chants and brutal ways of your people, inspiring those around you to new heights of violence and savagery.

**Prerequisites:** Cha 13, bardic performance class feature, half-orc or orc.

**Benefit:** When you use bardic performance with audible components on a battlefield (any area where a combat involving a dozen or more combatants is taking place), the range or area of your chosen performance is doubled. In addition, the DC for saving throws against your bardic performance is increased by +2 for creatures of the orc subtype, regardless of where the performance occurs.

## Well-Prepared

Somehow, you always seem to have the right tools or supplies close at hand.

**Prerequisite:** Halfling.

**Benefit:** Once per day, when confronted with a situation that calls for a particular mundane item of equipment, you may make a [Sleight of Hand](../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand) check with a DC of 10 plus the item's cost in gold pieces to âhappenâ to have such an item on your person. For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry—if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door. If you are stripped of your equipment or possessions, you lose the benefits of this feat until you have at least a day to resupply and âacquireâ new items. You must pay for these items normally.

**Special:** At the GM's option, a character can substitute the [Survival](../skills/survival.html#_survival) skill for [Sleight of Hand](../skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand) with this feat. Such a choice is permanent.
