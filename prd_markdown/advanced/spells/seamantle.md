 **Seamantle**

**School** conjuration (creation) [water]; **Level** druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a cup of water)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level

You sheathe yourself within a churning column of pure elemental water up to 30 feet high that fills your space. You gain a swim speed equal to your land speed and can see, hear, and breathe normally within the _seamantle_, but attacks against you are treated as if you were under the surface of the water. You gain improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves) against foes that do not have _ [freedom of movement](../../spells/freedomOfMovement.md#_freedom-of-movement)_ effects. The cover granted by the _seamantle_ does not enable you to make [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks or prevent attacks of opportunity. Magical attacks against you are unaffected unless they require attack rolls or state that they do not function underwater (such as _ [cloudkill](../../spells/cloudkill.md#_cloudkill)_).

The _seamantle_ blocks line of effect for any fire spell or supernatural fire effect, but enemies can attempt to use fire spells within the _seamantle_; this requires a caster level check (DC 20 + spell level), and if successful the fire spell takes effect as a bubble of steam contained within the _seamantle_ rather than its usual effect.

The _seamantle_ allows you to make a slam attack by forming a pseudopod of water, inflicting damage appropriate for your size. This slam attack has a reach of 30 feet. In addition, as a standard action, you can attempt to extinguish fires by touch. You automatically extinguish up to a 10-foot cube of normal fire. Against magical fire effects, your touch acts as _ [dispel magic](../../spells/dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic)_; this also applies to any non-instantaneous fire affect that comes into contact with you (such as _ [flame blade](../../spells/flameBlade.md#_flame-blade)_, _ [flaming sphere](../../spells/flamingSphere.md#_flaming-sphere)_, or _ [incendiary cloud](../../spells/incendiaryCloud.md#_incendiary-cloud)_). Even if you fail to extinguish a fire, you are not harmed by it. A _ [flaming](../../magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming)_ or _ [flaming burst](../../magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming-burst)_ weapon that strikes you has its power suppressed for 1d4 rounds if the wielder fails a Fortitude save.
