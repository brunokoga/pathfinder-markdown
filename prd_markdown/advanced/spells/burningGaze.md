 **Burning Gaze**

**School** evocation [fire]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (eye of a mundane salamander)

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

Your eyes burn like hot coals, allowing you to set objects or foes alight with a glance.

As a standard action as long as this spell's effects persist, you may direct your _burning gaze_ against a single creature or object within 30 feet of your location. Targeted creatures must succeed at a Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of fire damage. Unattended objects do not get a save. Creatures damaged by the spell must make a Reflex save or catch fire. Each round, burning creatures may attempt a Reflex save to quench the flames; failure results in another 1d6 points of fire damage. Flammable items worn by a creature must also save or take the same damage as the creature. If a creature or object is already on fire, it suffers no additional effects from _burning gaze_.

Note that this spell does not grant an actual gaze attackâ€”foes and allies are not in danger of catching on fire simply by meeting your gaze.
