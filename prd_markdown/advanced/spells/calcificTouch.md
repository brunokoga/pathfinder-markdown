 **Calcific Touch**

**School** transmutation [earth]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature or creatures touched (up to one per level)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Your touch progressively transmutes the substance of creatures you touch into stone. Once per round, you may deliver a touch attack that inflicts 1d4 points of Dexterity damage and slows the target (as the spell) for 1 round. A successful Fortitude save negates the slow effect but not the ability damage. A target reduced to 0 Dexterity is petrified permanently. _ [Break enchantment](../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment)_, _ [restoration](../../spells/restoration.html#_restoration)_, or _ [stone to flesh](../../spells/stoneToFlesh.html#_stone-to-flesh)_ can reverse the effects of _calcific touch_.
