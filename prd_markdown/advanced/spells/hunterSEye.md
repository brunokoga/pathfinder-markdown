Sharpening your perceptive abilities and tuning them against obfuscating effects, _hunter's eye_ greatly enhances your senses against the target creature. You gain the ability to perceive the target when it is invisible or ethereal as though using the _ [see invisibility](../../spells/seeInvisibility#_see-invisibility)_ spell, and receive a +20 competence bonus on [Perception](../../skills/perception#_perception) checks to locate the target. You ignore concealment provided by fog or mist, _ [blur](../../spells/blur#_blur)_, _ [displacement](../../spells/displacement#_displacement)_, _ [invisibility](../../spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_, and similar effects affecting the target, but not concealment provided by darkness. This spell provides no benefits to your allies, and no benefits against creatures other than the target.
