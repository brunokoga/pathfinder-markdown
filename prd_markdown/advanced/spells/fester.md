 **Fester**

**School** necromancy; **Level** inquisitor 3, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (rotted meat)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level or 1 round; see text

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

Necrotic energy permeates the target, blocking healing abilities. The subject gains spell resistance equal to 12 + your caster level against effects that restore hit points or grant temporary hit points. In addition, any healing provided by effects that ignore spell resistance (such as fast healing, regeneration, and some spells) are halved. If the target succeeds on a Fortitude saving throw, _fester_ lasts only a single round.

**Fester, Mass**

**School** necromancy; **Level** inquisitor 6, witch 6

**Target** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

This spell functions as _fester_, except that it affects multiple foes.
