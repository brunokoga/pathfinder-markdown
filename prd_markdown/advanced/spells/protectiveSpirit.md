A _protective spirit_ is an invisible, mindless, shapeless force that hovers about you, defending you against unexpected attacks. When a creature makes an attack of opportunity against you, the _protective spirit_ makes an immediate attack using your base attack bonus plus your Dexterity modifier. On a successful hit, the spirit does no damage, but it causes the attack of opportunity to automatically miss. A _protective spirit_ can defend against a number of attacks of opportunity equal to your Dexterity bonus (minimum 1) per round.

A _protective spirit_ occupies your space, and moves with you. It cannot be attacked or harmed by physical attacks, but _ [dispel magic](../../spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic)_, _ [disintegrate](../../spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate)_, a _sphere of annihilation_, or a _ [rod of cancellation](../../magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation)_ affects it. A _protective spirit_'s AC against touch attacks is 10 + your Dexterity modifier.
