You subtly enhance or diminish the effects of natural winds within the spell's area, which is an immobile emanation around a point touched by you as the spell is cast. Within the area, natural (but not magical) wind effects are either increased or decreased by one step in intensity (_Core Rulebook_ 439). The maximum wind force you can affect with this spell is based on your caster level, as shown on the table below. _Alter winds_ has no effect on magical wind effects.
