_Brand_ etches an indelible rune or mark of no more than 6 characters onto a creature, inflicting 1 point of damage. The mark may be placed on any exposed portion of the creature, typically the head or forearm. A _brand_ can be hidden by clothing or removed by scraping it away (causing 1d6 points of damage), though the _brand_ returns if the damage is healed.

This spell functions like _brand_, except that it inflicts 1d6 points of damage when applied and cannot be removed, even temporarily. In addition, a _greater brand_ blazes as bright as a torch when brought within 30 feet of a visible symbol of your faith. While the symbol is blazing, the recipient is sickened. Like the effects of _ [bestow curse](../../spells/bestowCurse.md#_bestow-curse)_, a _greater brand_ cannot be dispelled, but it can be removed by any means that removes a _ [mark of justice](../../spells/markOfJustice.md#_mark-of-justice)_.
