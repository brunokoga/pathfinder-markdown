 **Cup of Dust**

**School** transmutation; **Level** druid 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component** V, S, M (a pinch of dust)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 day/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You curse the target with a thirst no drink can quench. On a failed saving throw, the target begins to [dehydrate](../../environment.html#_starvation-and-thirst). The effects of this spell cannot inflict more nonlethal damage than the target has hit points. No amount of drinking can counter this effect, although the target still experiences the other normal effects of any liquid imbibed (such as poisons or potions). _Cup of dust _can be removed with a _ [break enchantment](../../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment), [limited wish](../../spells/limitedWish.html#_limited-wish), [miracle](../../spells/miracle.html#_miracle), [remove curse](../../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse), _or _ [wish](../../spells/wish.html#_wish)_ spell, but effects suffered as a result of dehydration must be healed by normal means.
