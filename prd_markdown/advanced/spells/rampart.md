You create a massive rampart of hard-packed earth and stone 5 feet thick. The _rampart_ cannot be conjured so that it occupies the same space as another creature or object. Each 5-foot-wide section of the _rampart_ has hardness 0 and 180 hit points. A section of the _rampart_ whose hit points drop to 0 is breached. If a creature tries to break through the _rampart_ with a single attack, the DC for the Strength check is 60. A creature can climb over the _rampart_ with a DC 20 [Climb](../../skills/climb.md#_climb) check.
