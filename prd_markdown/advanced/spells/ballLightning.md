 **Ball Lightning**

**School** evocation [air, electricity]; **Level** druid 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M/DF (a small iron ring)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** two or more 5-ft.-diameter spheres

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You create two globes of lightning that fly in whichever direction you indicate. For every 4 caster levels above 7th, you create an additional globe of lightning (3 globes at 11th, 4 globes at 15th, to the maximum of 5 globes at 19th). These globes fly at a rate of 20 feet per round and have perfect maneuverability. Wind does not affect a flying sphere's course.

If a globe enters a space with a creature, it stops moving for the round and deals 3d6 points of electricity damage to that creature, though a successful Reflex save negates the damage. Creatures wearing metal armor take a â€“4 penalty on this saving throw.

Each globe moves as long as you actively direct it (it's a move action for you to direct all the spheres created by a single casting of this spell); otherwise they stay at rest. These globes have no mass and cannot push aside unwilling creatures or move solid objects. A _ball lightning_ globe winks out if it exceeds the spell's range.
