**Components** V, S, M (a pinch of powdered moonstone )

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You invoke the mystical power of the moon to drive the target into a mad, bestial frenzy. If the target fails its save, it is dazed for 1 round, dropping held items as its nails and teeth elongate and sharpen. The target gains a bite attack and two claw attacks that deal damage appropriate for the creature's size, and for the remainder of the spell's duration the target behaves as if under simultaneous _ [rage](../../spells/rage.html#_rage)_ and _ [confusion](../../spells/confusion.html#_confusion)_ spells, attacking with its natural weapons in preference to other actions. During the final round of the spell's duration, the target is again dazed as it returns to its normal state.
