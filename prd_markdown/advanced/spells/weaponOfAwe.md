 **Weapon of Awe**

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 2, inquisitor 2, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** touch

**Target** weapon touched

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless, object); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless, object)

You transform a single weapon into an awe-inspiring instrument. The weapon gains a +2 sacred bonus on damage rolls, and if the weapon scores a critical hit, the target of that critical hit becomes shaken for 1 round with no saving throw. This is a mind-affecting fear effect. A ranged weapon affected by this spell applies these effects to its ammunition.

You can't cast this spell on a natural weapon, but you can cast it on an unarmed strike.
