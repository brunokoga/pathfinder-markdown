# Wondrous Items

Wondrous items is a catchall category for anything that doesn't fall into the other groups of magic items. Any creature can use a wondrous item (unless specified otherwise in the description, such as requiring a particular class feature).

**All Tools Vest**

**Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

The stitching along the many pockets of this light leather vest depicts cheerful laborers going about their daily work. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak its command word and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one [Craft](../../skills/craft.md#_craft) skill. These tools appear in the countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes first.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [summon instrument](../../spells/summonInstrument.md#_summon-instrument)_; **Cost** 900 gp

**Amulet of Magecraft**

**Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 9th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 20,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

Each silver link that makes up this heavy necklace represents a well-known concept of arcane theory. A universalist wizard who selects the necklace as his bonded object (which counts as an amulet) may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chose “evocation” when he prepared his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared _ [fireball](../../spells/fireball.md#_fireball)_ into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [permanency](../../spells/permanency.md#_permanency)_, creator must be a universalist; **Cost** 10,000 gp

**Amulet of Spell Cunning**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

**Annihilation Spectacles**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th

**Slot** eyes; **Price** 25,000 gp; **Weight** 1/4 lb.

**Description**

Creatures viewed through these darkly tinted glasses sometimes seem, ever so briefly, to flicker in and out of existence. A transmuter can use these spectacles to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard transmutation spell into any other wizard transmutation spell he knows; the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. Once per day, he may use the spectacles to spontaneously cast _ [disintegrate](../../spells/disintegrate.md#_disintegrate)_ in place of one of his prepared transmutation wizard spells of 6th level or higher, even if he doesn't know that spell.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [disintegrate](../../spells/disintegrate.md#_disintegrate)_, creator must be a transmuter; **Cost** 12,500 gp

**Apple of Eternal Sleep**

**Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,500 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This beautiful, ripe red apple appears fresh and tempting. Should anyone bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an immediate DC 19 Will saving throw or be stricken by [eternal sleep](../baseClasses/witch.md#_eternal-slumber), the same as the witch's hex of that name. The victim can only be awakened by a casting of _ [break enchantment](../../spells/breakEnchantment.md#_break-enchantment)_, _ [limited wish](../../spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_, _ [wish](../../spells/wish.md#_wish)_, or _ [miracle](../../spells/miracle.md#_miracle)_, or by a kiss from someone of royal blood.

**Construction**

**Assisting Glove**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 1st

**Slot** hands; **Price** 180 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

The wearer of this simple glove can speak a command word to transform it into a glowing disembodied hand. As a swift action, the wearer can have the glove assist him with a task as if using the aid another action; the glove uses the wearer's base attack bonus or skill ranks when making the check to see if aid another is successful (it does not gain the benefit of the wearer's ability scores or other bonuses). The hand remains until it has attempted one action or until 1 minute passes, whichever comes first, at which time it becomes a nonmagical lambskin glove.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [mage hand](../../spells/mageHand.md#_mage-hand)_, _ [unseen servant](../../spells/unseenServant.md#_unseen-servant)_; **Cost** 90 gp

**Bandages of Rapid Recovery**

**Aura** faint conjuration (healing); **CL** 1st

**Slot** chest; **Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest regardless of activity (_Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook _191). A creature actually receiving long-term care (from the [Heal](../../skills/heal.md#_heal) skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day. The bandages are destroyed once removed or when the wearer recovers all hit points and ability damage, whichever comes first.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [cure light wounds](../../spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_, _ [lesser restoration](../../spells/restoration.md#_restoration-lesser)_, _ [stabilize](../../spells/stabilize.md#_stabilize)_; **Cost** 100 gp

**Slot** none; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This digest-sized book contains a seemingly random collection of words, phrases, and strange mnemonic aids. Three times each day, a bard can consult it while using the lore master class feature in order to gain a +5 competence bonus when taking 10 or taking 20 on a [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) check.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [clairaudience/clairvoyance](../../spells/clairaudienceClairvoyance.md#_clairaudience-clairvoyance)_; **Cost** 7,500 gp

**Boots of Friendly Terrain**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** feet; **Price** 2,400 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

Each pair of these supple leather boots corresponds to a specific sort of environment as defined by the ranger's favored terrain class feature (jungle, plains, and so on). A ranger wearing the boots can treat the corresponding environment of the boots as one of his favored terrains, granting him a +2 bonus. If he already has that particular environment as one of his favored terrains, his bonus for that terrain increases by +2.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [pass without trace](../../spells/passWithoutTrace.md#_pass-without-trace)_, creator must be a ranger; **Cost** 1,200 gp

**Bottle of Messages**

**Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd

**Slot** none; **Price** 300 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the bottle speaks into the bottle during this time (up to 25 words) gets trapped inside it once the cork fully manifests. As soon as the cork is removed or the bottle is smashed, this message is released exactly as if the owner had spoken the words at that moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [magic mouth](../../spells/magicMouth.md#_magic-mouth)_; **Cost** 150 gp

**Bracelet of Mercy**

**Aura** faint conjuration (healing); **CL** 5th

**Slot** wrist; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

Each gem in this metal bracelet has a tiny inscription from a holy book. If the wearer has the mercy class feature, she gains the diseased mercy. If the wearer already has that mercy, her effective caster level for removing diseases increases by +4.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [remove disease](../../spells/removeDisease.md#_remove-disease)_; **Cost** 7,500 gp

**Campfire Bead**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 720 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This tiny glass bead transforms itself into a small (2-foot-tall) pile of burning logs whenever its command word is spoken. The fire burns for 8 hours or until extinguished, at which point it turns back into a bead. The owner of the item must wait twice as long as the fire burned before he can order the bead to become a campfire again.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [produce flame](../../spells/produceFlame.md#_produce-flame)_; **Cost** 360 gp

**Catching Cape**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** shoulders; **Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. The wearer can, as a swift action, order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer a concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first. When the field ends, all magic is lost from the cloak, leaving only a mundane silvery garment.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [shield](../../spells/shield.md#_shield)_; **Cost** 100 gp

**Cauldron of Brewing**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 3,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

A _cauldron of brewing_ looks like a fine cooking pot with four stout legs. The cauldron is capable of heating any liquid placed in it to a precise temperature (anywhere from just above room temperature to hot enough to boil salt water) and maintaining it indefinitely while still remaining only slightly warm to the touch on the outside. A _cauldron of brewing_ provides a +5 competence bonus on [Craft](../../skills/craft.md#_craft) (alchemy) skill checks.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), trained in [Craft](../../skills/craft.md#_craft) (Alchemy); **Cost** 1,500 gp

**Cauldron of Flying**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 40,000 gp; **Weight** 100 lbs.

**Description**

This iron pot is large enough for two Medium humanoids to stand in comfortably. Upon command, the cauldron and up to 500 pounds of additional weight can fly as if using _ [overland flight](../../spells/overlandFlight.md#_overland-flight)_. The cauldron moves under the direction of the person who spoke the activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the need for a [Fly](../../skills/fly.md#_fly) skill check. The cauldron provides partial cover for anyone standing in it. It has a hardness of 10 and 60 hit points.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [overland flight](../../spells/overlandFlight.md#_overland-flight)_; **Cost** 20,000 gp

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th

**Slot** none; **Price** 15,000 gp; **Weight** 25 lbs.

This enchanted iron pot can produce nourishing, simple fare sufficient to feed up to 36 people per day upon command. Once per week it can also be commanded to create a _ [heroes' feast](../../spells/heroesFeast.md#_heroes-feast)_ for up to 12 people. The cauldron needs neither fire nor ingredients to produce food; it does so instantly upon command.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [create food and water](../../spells/createFoodAndWater.md#_create-food-and-water)_, _ [heroes' feast](../../spells/heroesFeast.md#_heroes-feast)_; **Cost** 7,500 gp

**Cauldron of Resurrection**

**Aura** strong conjuration (healing); **CL** 13th

**Slot** none; **Price** 33,000 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

The mouth of this heavy, dark iron cauldron is shaped like a monstrous maw and is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When the cauldron is filled with pure water and certain rare and sacred herbs, and a deceased creature is placed inside it, the cauldron can restore the creature to life as if from a _ [raise dead](../../spells/raiseDead.md#_raise-dead)_ or _ [resurrection](../../spells/resurrection.md#_resurrection)_ spell. The spell effect depends on the components used: _ [raise dead](../../spells/raiseDead.md#_raise-dead)_ costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while _ [resurrection](../../spells/resurrection.md#_resurrection)_ costs 10,000 gp worth of materials. The cauldron can function once per day.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [resurrection](../../spells/resurrection.md#_resurrection)_; **Cost** 16,500 gp

**Cauldron of Seeing**

**Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 42,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

When filled with liquid, this small cauldron allows the user to see over virtually any distance as if using the _ [scrying](../../spells/scrying.md#_scrying)_ spell. It may have additional powers like those of a _ [crystal ball](../../magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_crystal-ball)_ for the same prices.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [scrying](../../spells/scrying.md#_scrying)_; **Cost** 21,000 gp

**Cauldron of the Dead**

**Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 30,000 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

**Description**

This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if animated by an _ [animate dead](../../spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)_ spell. Each corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron can animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the undead so created—up to 12 HD, unless the user can cast the _ [animate dead](../../spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)_ spell, in which case that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate dead](../../spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)_; **Cost** 15,000 gp

**Clamor Box**

**Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 10th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,000 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

This delicate tin music box can produce a great volume of noise at a specific time determined by its owner. Four command words determine what sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [ghost sound](../../spells/ghostSound.md#_ghost-sound)_; **Cost** 1,000 gp

**Construct Channel Brick**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th

**Slot** none; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

This solid red brick changes its shape to match its bearer's holy symbol. If the bearer has the channel energy class feature, she can focus her power on the brick, allowing her to repair damaged constructs and objects as if they were living creatures. The item works whether the bearer channels positive or negative energy. If the bearer has the artifice domain, she adds +2d6 points of damage to her channel energy result when repairing constructs and objects.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [make whole](../../spells/makeWhole.md#_make-whole)_; **Cost** 5,000 gp

**Cowardly Crouching Cloak**

**Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st

**Slot** shoulders; **Price** 1,800 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

**Description**

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer's entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the _ [sanctuary](../../spells/sanctuary.md#_sanctuary)_ spell). The wearer cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless. The wearer can end his crouch simply by standing up or moving.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [sanctuary](../../spells/sanctuary.md#_sanctuary)_; **Cost** 900 gp

**Crystal of Healing Hands**

**Aura** moderate conjuration (healing); **CL** 10th

**Slot** neck; **Price** 12,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A simple cotton cord holds this glittering prism in place. A person with the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of this energy into the crystal, which stores it until the wearer speaks a command word to release it. Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal with its power. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving the lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into the crystal, including any mercies they had at the time.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [cure light wounds](../../spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_, creator must be a paladin; **Cost** 6,000 gp

**Defoliant Polish**

**Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** none; **Price** 800 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by _defoliant polish_ with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [diminish plants](../../spells/diminishPlants.md#_diminish-plants)_; **Cost** 400 gp

**Doomharp**

**Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 4th

**Slot** none; **Price** 10,000 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Description**

Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has the bardic performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability. A bard who can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as part of his performance increases the effective radius to 60 feet.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [cause fear](../../spells/causeFear.md#_cause-fear)_; **Cost** 5,000 gp

**Dust of Emulation**

**Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 1st

**Slot** none; **Price** 800 gp ; **Weight** —

**Description**

A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact with any one item or object as if she had successfully used the [Use Magic Device](../../skills/useMagicDevice.md#_use-magic-device) skill to emulate a class feature or race (if the exact result of the check matters, treat the character's result as a 25). If the user of the dust does not mentally select the intended item or object while coating herself with the dust, the magic of the dust applies to the first eligible object she encounters. She can apply the result of this automatic check when dealing with the item or object for 1 hour after exposure to the dust.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [disguise self](../../spells/disguiseSelf.md#_disguise-self)_; **Cost** 400 gp

**Flying Ointment**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** none; **Price** 2,250 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This preparation of herbs includes belladonna, mandrake, and foxglove (also known as “witch's glove”) in a base of rendered fats. When rubbed over the skin, the ointment grants the subject the ability to fly (as the_ [overland flight](../../spells/overlandFlight.md#_overland-flight)_ spell) for up to 9 hours.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Craft Wondrous Item](../../feats.md#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [overland flight](../../spells/overlandFlight.md#_overland-flight)_; **Cost** 1,125 gp

It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.

A _lord's banner_ may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.

_Crusades_: A noble-looking _lord's banner of crusades_ emits a _ [hallow](../../spells/hallow.md#_hallow)_ effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design). The banner displays the faith's holy symbol along with the owner's crest.

_Swiftness_: A group or army that are traveling under a _lord's banner of swiftness_ can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.

_Terror_: Enemies of the bearer of a _lord's banner of terror_, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a Will saving throw (DC 16) or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 1 day.

_Victory_: Allies of the owner of a _lord's banner of victory_ gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.
