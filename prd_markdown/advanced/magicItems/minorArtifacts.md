# Minor Artifacts

Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that can no longer be created, at least by common mortal means.

**Beacon of True Faith**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 2 lbs.

**Description**

The _beacon of true faith_ takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. The torch holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of especially strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. All of these are command-word activated.

Chaotic (violet flame): _ [Word of chaos](../../spells/wordOfChaos.html#_word-of-chaos)_ once per day on command.

Good (white flame): Allies within 30 feet of the beacon gain the benefits of _ [protection from evil](../../spells/protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)_ and _ [heroism](../../spells/heroism.html#_heroism)_.

Evil (black flame): Bearer is constantly under the effect of _ [protection from good](../../spells/protectionFromGood.html#_protection-from-good)_ and may use _ [harm](../../spells/harm.html#_harm)_ twice per day.

Lawful (golden flame): _ [Dictum](../../spells/dictum.html#_dictum)_ once per day on command.

**Destruction**

The _beacon of true faith_ is destroyed if its bearer turns against the worship of his deity to willingly embrace an opposite alignment.

**Hammer of Thunderbolts**

**Aura** strong evocation, necromancy, and transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Description**

This _+3 Large [returning](../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-returning) warhammer_ deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a _ [belt of giant strength](../../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_belt-of-giant-strength)_ and knows the weapon is a _hammer of thunderbolts_ (not just the _+3 warhammer_ it appears to be), it becomes a _+5 Large giant-bane [returning](../../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-returning) [thundering](../../magicItems/weapons.html#_thundering) warhammer_ with the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment increases to 30 feet.

**Destruction**

A _hammer of thunderbolts_ is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of the _hammer_ to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse its brittleness; once shattered, nothing can do so.

**Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune**

**Aura** strong (all schools); **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the _knucklebone's_ true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see Table 7–13). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.

[Table: Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune]
| d20 | Rune Name | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Eya-Doh | The character gains 1 permanent negative level. |
| 2 | Bvu | The character is subject to a powerful compulsion never to roll the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ again. He can shake this compulsion only by succeeding a DC 25 Will saving throw. He can only attempt this saving throw once a day. |
| 3 | Eij | The character is affected by a _ [harm](../../spells/harm.html#_harm)_ spell (caster level 15th). |
| 4 | Hor | The character is subject to a powerful compulsion to roll the _knucklebone_ three more times immediately (Will DC 25 negates). All three of these rolls are made with a –5 penalty on the _knucklebone's_ die roll (minimum 1). |
| 5 | Veh | The character is blinded as with _ [blindness/deafness](../../spells/blindnessDeafness.html#_blindness-deafness)_ (no saving throw). |
| 6 | Chu | The character takes 5d10 points of cold damage (DC 25 Fort save for half) and moves at half speed for the next hour (a successful saving throw does not negate the reduced speed). |
| 7 | Roh | For the next 24 hours, the character suffers a –2 penalty on all skill and ability checks. |
| 8 | Seh | The character is paralyzed for 2d12 hours, as with _ [hold monster](../../spells/holdMonster.html#_hold-monster)_, except he cannot attempt new saving throws to overcome the effect. |
| 9 | Kog | For the next week, the character emits a horrible smell. He suffers a –4 penalty on [Diplomacy](../../skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy) and [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth) checks. |
| 10 | Vis | Once, during the next 24 hours, the character can reroll a single die roll he has just made and take the second result, as if using the good fortune ability from the Luck domain. |
| 11 | Fyeh | The character gains 100 points of fire immunity, as if using _ [protection from energy](../../spells/protectionFromEnergy.html#_protection-from-energy)_. |
| 12 | Xal | The character gains the benefits of a _ [heroism](../../spells/heroism.html#_heroism)_ spell for the next 200 minutes. |
| 13 | Yaq | For the next 24 hours, when the character hits a target he is flanking with a melee weapon, the attack does +1d6 points of precision damage. |
| 14 | Gib | Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast _ [faerie fire](../../spells/faerieFire.html#_faerie-fire)_ (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ before the 24 hours is concluded. |
| 15 | Xku | The character is immune to fear for the next 24 hours. |
| 16 | Lev | Once in the next 24 hours, the character can cast a _ [lightning bolt](../../spells/lightningBolt.html#_lightning-bolt)_ (caster level equal to his character level). This ability is lost if the character rolls this result again with the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ before the 24 hours is concluded. |
| 17 | Nhi | For the next 7 days, when the character is the target of healing magic, he heals an additional 2d8 hit points. This effect is lost if the character rolls the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ again before the 7 days are concluded. |
| 18 | Zmi | For the next 24 hours, whenever the character succeeds on a saving throw against a harmful effect that does half damage or partial effect on a failed save, the _knucklebone's_ character takes no damage or suffers no effect. |
| 19 | Tem | For the next 24 hours, the character automatically confirms all critical hits. |
| 20 | Eha-Zah | The next time the character dies, he comes back from the dead the very next morning as if the subject of a _ [resurrection](../../spells/resurrection.html#_resurrection)_ spell. This effect is negated if the character rolls the _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ again before he dies. |

**Destruction**

The _knucklebone of fickle fortune_ disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some random spot in the world, but such knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.

**Perfect Golden Lute**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 3 lbs.

**Description**

The _perfect golden lute_ is said to be a flawless instrument; its tone and clarity are unrivaled. It is an instrument so fine it practically performs itself, granting anyone who plays it a +10 competency bonus on [Perform](../../skills/perform.html#_perform) (string instruments) checks with it. A character with ranks in [Perform](../../skills/perform.html#_perform) (string instrument) can play the lute to activate countersong, distraction, or fascinate (as the bardic performance abilities) as if he were a 1st-level bard, performing a number of rounds per day equal to his Charisma modifier. If the user of the _perfect golden lute_ is a bard, he adds +2 to the DC of all bardic performance abilities using the lute, and can use bardic performance with the lute for an additional 6 rounds per day.

**Destruction**

The _perfect golden lute_ shatters into splinters if a day passes in which no music is played within 1,000 miles of it, or if its bearer is killed by a bard spell or bardic performance.

**Spindle of Perfect [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge)**

**Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** —

**Description**

The _spindle of perfect knowledge_ is large, bright, and flawless marquise-cut diamond _ [ioun stone](../../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_ioun-stones)_ the size of a halfling's fist. The gemstone would be a treasure in itself if it lacked magic, but it is also a powerful _ [ioun stone](../../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_ioun-stones)_. The _spindle of perfect knowledge_ functions like a _ [headband of mental superiority](../../magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_headband-of-mental-superiority)_ +4 and grants 5 ranks in two random [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge) skills. The wearer can communicate and understand languages as if using _ [comprehend languages](../../spells/comprehendLanguages.html#_comprehend-languages)_, _ [tongues](../../spells/tongues.html#_tongues)_, and telepathy with a range of 100 feet.

**Destruction**

The _spindle of perfect knowledge_ is destroyed if worn by a mindless creature for an entire year.

**Talisman of Reluctant Wishes**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th

**Slot** none; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Description**

A _talisman of reluctant wishes_ appears the same as a _stone of controlling earth elementals_, a rugged rock that seems to pulse with an inner power. Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a _talisman of reluctant wishes_ must make a DC 15 Charisma check.

If the check fails, the talisman acts as a _ [stone of weight](../../magicItems/specificCursedItems.html#_stone-of-weight)_. Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.

If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a _ [wish](../../spells/wish.html#_wish)_ is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.

If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like.

The artifact grants one _ [wish](../../spells/wish.html#_wish)_ for every 6 points of the character's Charisma (round down). It grows warm and throbs whenever its possessor comes within 20 feet of a mechanical or magic trap. (If the talisman is not held, its warning heat and pulses are of no avail.)

Regardless of which reaction results, a _talisman of reluctant wishes_ disappears when its time expires, leaving behind a large diamond in its stead, valued at 1,000 gp per point of the character's Charisma.

**Destruction**

A _talisman of reluctant wishes_ can be destroyed by wishing it so, using either one of the stone's _wishes_ or a _ [wish](../../spells/wish.html#_wish)_ spell from another source. The stone then explodes, causing 5d6 points of damage to the holder.
