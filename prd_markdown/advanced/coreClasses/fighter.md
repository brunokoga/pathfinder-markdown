# Fighter

From dockside brawlers to legendary champions, poor foot soldiers to the greatest duelists of the nobility, fighters are those who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the art of combat. While barbarians tap into raw fury in battle, fighters know that the mind is the keenest weapon, and they use theirs to great effect, mastering numerous armaments and fighting styles in a never-ending quest to be the last warrior standing.

Presented below are a number of common martial themes, complete with variant class abilities to help customize characters to their chosen fighting style.

# Archer

The archer is dedicated to the careful mastery of the bow, perfecting his skills with years of practice honed day after day on ranges and hunting for game, or else on the battlefield, raining destruction down on the enemy lines.

**Hawkeye (Ex)** : At 2nd level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception) checks, and the range increment for any bow he uses increases by 5 feet. These bonuses increase by +1 and 5 additional feet for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Trick Shot (Ex)** : At 3rd level, an archer can choose one of the following combat maneuvers or actions: disarm, feint, or sunder. He can perform this action with a bow against any target within 30 feet, with a –4 penalty to his CMB. Every four levels beyond 3rd, he may choose an additional trick shot to learn. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal.

At 11th level, he may also choose from the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, grapple, trip. A target grappled by an arrow can break free by destroying the archer's arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 13) or with an [Escape Artist](../../skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) or CMB check (against the archer's CMD –4). This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Expert Archer (Ex)** : At 5th level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with bows. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 5th. This ability replaces weapon training 1.

**Safe Shot (Ex)** : At 9th level, an archer does not provoke attacks of opportunity when making ranged attacks with a bow. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Evasive Archer (Ex)** : At 13th level, an archer gains a +2 dodge bonus to AC against ranged attacks. This bonus increases to +4 at 17th level. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Volley (Ex)** : At 17th level, as a full-round action, an archer can make a single bow attack at his highest base attack bonus against any number of creatures in a 15-foot- radius burst, making separate attack and damage rolls for each creature. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Ranged Defense (Ex)** : At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/— against ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an arrow fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses, as if he had the [Snatch Arrows](../../feats.md#_snatch-arrows) feat. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)** : An archer must choose a type of bow.

# Crossbowman

The crossbowman has perfected the deadly use of the crossbow, a simple but cruelly efficient weapon, as a craftsman mastering a lethal tool.

**Deadshot (Ex)** : At 3rd level, when a crossbowman attacks with a crossbow as a readied action, he may add 1/2 his Dexterity bonus (minimum +1) on his damage roll. This ability replaces armor training 1.

**Meteor Shot (Ex)** : At 17th level, as a standard action, a crossbowman can make one attack with a crossbow at a –4 penalty. If the attack hits, it inflicts damage normally and the target is subject to a bull rush or a trip maneuver using the attack roll as the combat maneuver check. The crossbowman must decide which maneuver to attempt before making his attack roll. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Penetrating Shot (Ex)** : At 19th level, when a crossbowman confirms a critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it. The crossbowman must be able to trace a line starting at his space and passing through both targets to make this additional attack. The secondary attack is made at a –4 penalty, in addition to any modifiers for added range. If this attack is also a critical hit, the bolt can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)** : A crossbowman must choose a type of crossbow.

# Free Hand Fighter

The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and distract his opponents. While not a brawler, his open hand is as much a weapon as a bow or blade. His fighting school benefits only apply when he is using a one-handed weapon and carrying nothing in his other hand.

**Deceptive Strike (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a free hand fighter gains a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD on disarm checks and on [Bluff](../../skills/bluff.md#_bluff) checks to feint or create a diversion to hide. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels after 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Timely Tip (Ex)** : At 9th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push aside the target's shield. If successful, the target loses its shield bonus to AC against the free hand fighter's next attack. This ability replaces weapon training 2.

**Interference (Ex)** : At 13th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push his opponent off balance. If successful, the target becomes flat-footed. This condition lasts until the target takes damage from a melee or ranged attack or until the beginning of the free hand fighter's next turn, whichever comes first. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Reversal (Ex)** : At 19th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm combat maneuver against a creature he threatens as an immediate action when he is the target of a melee attack from another creature. If successful, the attack changes to target the target of the free hand fighter's maneuver instead of the free hand fighter himself. This ability replaces armor mastery.

# Mobile Fighter

Where some fighters focus on strength and raw power, the mobile fighter relies on swiftness and mobility, gliding across the battlefield like a steel whirlwind and leaving destruction in his wake.

**Agility (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a mobile fighter gains a +1 bonus on saving throws made against effects that cause him to become paralyzed, slowed, or entangled. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Rapid Attack (Ex)** : At 11th level, a mobile fighter can combine a full attack action with a single move. He must forgo the attack at his highest bonus but may take the remaining attacks at any point during his movement. This movement provokes attacks of opportunity as normal. This ability replaces armor training 3.

**[Fleet](../../feats.md#_fleet) Footed (Ex)** : At 15th level, the mobile fighter's speed increases by 10 feet. He can take 10 on [Acrobatics](../../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks even while distracted or threatened, and can take 20 on an [Acrobatics](../../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check once per day for every five fighter levels he possesses. This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Whirlwind Blitz (Ex)** : At 20th level, a mobile fighter can make a full-attack action as a standard action. He may also use the [Whirlwind Attack](../../feats.md#_whirlwind-attack) feat as a standard action. This ability replaces weapon mastery.

# Phalanx Soldier

The phalanx soldier specializes in defensive tactics, using his shield to guard himself and his allies and forming a shield wall like an unbreakable anvil against which his enemies break.

**Stand Firm (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a phalanx soldier gains a +1 bonus to CMD against bull rush, overrun, and trip attempts. This bonus also applies on saves against trample attacks. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

At 13th level, he can instead provide cover (+4 cover bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) and evasion (as a rogue) to one adjacent ally until the beginning of his next turn. This cover does not allow [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks.

At 17th level, he can provide cover to himself and all adjacent allies, or he can provide improved cover (+8 cover bonus to AC, +4 bonus on Reflex saves, improved evasion) to a single adjacent ally. This ability replaces weapon training 2, 3, and 4.

**Irresistible Advance (Ex)** : At 15th level, a phalanx fighter gains a bonus on bull rush and overrun CMB checks. This bonus depends on the type of shield used: +1 with a buckler, +2 with a light shield, +3 with a heavy shield, or +4 with a tower shield. This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Shielded Fortress (Ex)** : At 20th level, a phalanx fighter's shield cannot be disarmed or sundered. He gains evasion (as a rogue) when using a shield (improved evasion when using a tower shield). As a move action, a phalanx fighter can provide evasion to all adjacent allies until the beginning of his next turn. As an immediate action, he can provide improved evasion to an adjacent ally against one attack. This ability replaces weapon mastery.

# Polearm Master

The polearm master is schooled in the ancient wisdom that enemies are best faced at the end of long striking pole, lashing like a serpent before clumsy swords and axes can even be brought to bear.

**Pole Fighting (Ex)** : At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets. This action results in a –4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon until he spends another immediate action to return to the normal grip. The penalty is reduced by –1 for every four levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.

**Steadfast Pike (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a polearm master gains a +1 bonus on attack rolls with readied attacks and attacks of opportunity made with a spear or polearm. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces armor training 1, 2, 3, and 4.

**Sweeping Fend (Ex)** : At 13th level, a polearm master can use any spear or pole arm to make a bull rush or trip maneuver, though he takes a –4 penalty to his CMB when making such attempts. Weapons with the trip property do not incur this penalty on trip maneuvers. This ability replaces weapon training 3.

**Step Aside (Ex)** : At 17th level, when a creature threatened by a polearm master takes a 5-foot step into a square adjacent to him, he can take a 5-foot step as an immediate action. This 5-foot step must be subtracted from his movement on the next turn. He also gains a +2 dodge bonus to his AC against that opponent until the end of his next turn. This ability replaces weapon training 4.

**Polearm Parry (Ex)** : At 19th level, when an opponent threatened by a polearm master makes a melee attack against an ally, he may take an immediate action to grant his ally a +2 shield bonus to AC and DR 5/— against that attack. He may use this ability to protect himself, but only if the attacking creature is not adjacent to him. This ability replaces armor mastery.

**Weapon Mastery (Ex)** : A polearm master must choose a spear or polearm.

# Roughrider

Roughriders study and practice the fine points of mounted combat, drilling endlessly with warbeasts—from noble thoroughbreds to trained monsters—to form a perfect synergy between rider and steed.

**Steadfast Mount (Ex)** : At 2nd level, after a roughrider has spent 1 hour practicing with a mount, the mount gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saves, but only while the roughrider is mounted on it or adjacent to it.

**Relentless Steed (Ex)** : At 11th level, a roughrider's mount does not reduce its speed when wearing heavy barding or carrying a heavy load. The roughrider may also reroll a [Ride](../../skills/ride.md#_ride) skill check or a saving throw made by the mount once per day, but must use the second roll even if it is worse. This ability may be used one additional time per day for every four levels beyond 11th. This ability replaces armor training 3.

**[Ride](../../skills/ride.md#_ride) Them Down (Ex)** : At 15th level, can spur his mount on while readying an attack.

This movement provokes attacks of opportunity against the roughrider but not his mount. This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Active Defense (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a shielded fighter gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC when wielding a shield and fighting defensively, using [Combat Expertise](../../feats.md#_combat-expertise), or using total defense.

This ability replaces armor training 4.

**Devastating Blow (Ex)** : At 19th level, as a standard action, a two-handed fighter may make a single melee attack with a two-handed weapon at a –5 penalty.

This ability replaces armor mastery.

# Two-Weapon Warrior

Trained under great masters who preached the simple truth that two are better than one when it comes to weapons, the two-weapon warrior is a terror when his hands are full. From paired daggers to exotic double weapons, all combinations come equally alive in his skilled hands.
