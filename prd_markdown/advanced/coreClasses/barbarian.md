# Barbarian

The true barbarian is a creature of bestial, savage fury. Whether a stoic tribal champion who whips herself into a berserker frenzy for the good of her sword-sisters, or a chaotic warrior who revels in carnage for its own sake, all barbarians share a similar approach to combat. Once the red haze of bloodlust descends, there is only a burning rage that carries them through the screaming fray, heedless of wounds and leaving scattered corpses in their wake.

Presented below are a number of new rage powers to help you customize your barbarian, as well as several classic barbarian archetypes to help you in building your character, each one including a number of suggested rage powers that, while not mandatory, work to flesh out the character concept. Rage powers marked with an asterisk (\*) can be found in the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_.

**Rage Powers (Ex)** : The following new rage powers can be taken by any barbarian that meets the prerequisites. Totem rage powers grant powers in a theme. A barbarian cannot select from more than one group of totem rage powers. For example, a barbarian that selects a beast totem rage power cannot later chose to gain any of the spirit totem rage powers.

_Beast Totem (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus. This bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the barbarian has attained. A barbarian must have the lesser beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

_Beast Totem, Greater (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian gains the pounce special ability, allowing her to make a full attack at the end of a charge. In addition, the damage from her claws increases to 1d8 (1d6 if Small) and the claws deal ×3 damage on a critical hit. A barbarian must have the beast totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

_Beast Totem, Lesser (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian gains two claw attacks. These attacks are considered primary attacks and are made at the barbarian's full base attack bonus. The claws deal 1d6 points of slashing damage (1d4 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier.

_Boasting [Taunt](../advancedFeats.md#_taunt) (Ex)_: While raging, the barbarian can incite a creature to attack her by making an [Intimidate](../../skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) check to demoralize. If the check succeeds, the target is also shaken as long as the barbarian is visible and raging or until it makes a melee attack against the barbarian. The barbarian receives a +2 circumstance bonus on this check for every alcoholic drink she has consumed during this rage. This is a language-dependent mind-affecting effect, and it relies on audible components. The barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this power.

_Brawler_: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has [Improved Unarmed Strike](../../feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike). If she already has the feat, her unarmed strikes deal 1d6 points of damage (1d4 if she is Small).

_Brawler, Greater_: While raging, the barbarian is treated as if she has [Two-Weapon Fighting](../../feats.md#_two-weapon-fighting) when making unarmed strike attacks. A barbarian must have the brawler rage power to select this rage power.

_Chaos Totem (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian's form becomes infused with chaos. She gains a +4 bonus on [Escape Artist](../../skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) checks and has a 25% chance to ignore extra damage from critical hits and sneak attacks. A barbarian must have the lesser chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

_Chaos Totem, Greater (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian gains DR/lawful equal to 1/2 her barbarian level. Her weapons and natural weapons are considered chaotic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. A barbarian must have the chaos totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

_Chaos Totem, Lesser (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian gains a +1 deflection bonus to AC against the attacks of lawful creatures and a +1 resistance bonus on saving throws against confusion, insanity, polymorph, and effects with the lawful descriptor. This bonus increases by +1 for each chaos totem rage power she possesses.

_Come and Get Me (Ex)_: While raging, as a free action the barbarian may leave herself open to attack while preparing devastating counterattacks. Enemies gain a +4 bonus on attack and damage rolls against the barbarian until the beginning of her next turn, but every attack against the barbarian provokes an attack of opportunity from her, which is resolved prior to resolving each enemy attack. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.

_ [Disruptive](../../feats.md#_disruptive)_: When raging, the barbarian gains [Disruptive](../../feats.md#_disruptive) as a bonus feat. The barbarian must have the superstition\* rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

_Elemental [Rage](../../spells/rage.md#_rage) (Su)_: While raging, all of the barbarian's melee attacks deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire). The type is chosen when the barbarian begins her rage. A barbarian must have the lesser elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power. Note that the barbarian can still use her lesser elemental rage power while using this rage power, but she must select a different energy type.

_Elemental [Rage](../../spells/rage.md#_rage), Greater (Su)_: While raging, all of the barbarian's critical hits made with melee weapons deal an additional 1d10 points of energy damage (2d10 if the weapon deals ×3 damage on a critical hit, 3d10 if the weapon deals ×4 on a critical hit). The type of this damage is the same as the type chosen for the elemental rage power. A barbarian must have the elemental rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.

_Elemental [Rage](../../spells/rage.md#_rage), Lesser (Su)_: As a swift action, the barbarian can cause her melee attacks to deal an additional 1d6 points of energy damage (acid, cold, electricity, or fire) for 1 round. A barbarian must be at least 4th level to select this rage power. This power can only be used once per rage.

_Energy Absorption (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack of her chosen energy type once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it, instead gaining 1 temporary hit point per 3 points of damage the attack would have inflicted. These temporary hit points last until the end of the barbarian's rage. A barbarian must have the greater energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.

_Energy Eruption (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian can absorb energy from a single attack and unleash it upon her enemies once per rage. She does not make a saving throw against the effect but takes no damage from it. At any point during the remainder of her rage she can unleash the stored energy as a breath weapon in either a 60-foot line or 30-foot cone. The breath weapon inflicts damage equal to the damage from the attack absorbed by the barbarian, but creatures within the area may make a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Constitution modifier) for half damage even if the original effect did not allow a save. A barbarian must have the energy absorption rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 16th level to select this rage power.

_Energy [Resistance](../../spells/resistance.md#_resistance) (Ex)_: While raging, the barbarian gains resistance to one energy type (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) equal to 1/2 her barbarian level (minimum 1). The energy type is chosen when this rage power is selected and it cannot be changed. This rage power can be selected more than once. Its effects do not stack. Each time is applies to a different energy type.

_Energy [Resistance](../../spells/resistance.md#_resistance), Greater (Ex)_: Once per rage, a barbarian can reduce damage by half from a single attack against which she has energy resistance (halve the damage, then apply resistance). A barbarian must have the energy resistance rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

_Ferocious [Mount](../../spells/mount.md#_mount) (Ex)_: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount also gains the benefits of rage (including greater rage and mighty rage) as long as the barbarian is mounted or adjacent to it. While her mount is raging in this way, she must spend one additional round of rage per round. She can elect not to pay this cost, in which case her mount does not rage.

_Ferocious [Mount](../../spells/mount.md#_mount), Greater (Ex)_: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the benefits of any rage powers that are constant in effect when the barbarian is raging. It does not gain the benefit of any rage powers that require actions to activate, even if they are free actions. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

_Ferocious [Trample](../../feats.md#_trample) (Ex)_: While raging and mounted, the barbarian's mount gains the trample special attack (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 305). This attack inflicts 1d8 points of damage for a Medium mount, 2d6 for a Large mount, or 2d8 for a Huge mount, plus 1–1/2 times the mount's Strength modifier. A successful Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the mount's Strength modifier) halves this damage. Creatures in the mount's path or that threaten squares it passes through may make attacks of opportunity against either the barbarian or the mount, but not both. A barbarian must have the ferocious mount rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 8th level to select this rage power.

_Ferocious [Trample](../../feats.md#_trample), Greater (Ex)_: A barbarian's mount can affect creatures up to its own size with its ferocious trample. In addition, it can make an overrun combat maneuver check as a free action against a creature that fails its Reflex save (or chooses not to save in order to take an attack of opportunity) against its trample. A barbarian must have the ferocious trample rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 12th level to select this rage power.

_Fiend Totem (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian sprouts dozens of wicked barbs from her body. Anyone striking the barbarian with a melee weapon, an unarmed strike, or a natural weapon takes 1d6 points of piercing damage. A barbarian must have the lesser fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

_Fiend Totem, Greater (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian is surrounded by an aura of menace. Good creatures adjacent to the barbarian are shaken and take 2d6 points of slashing damage at the beginning of the barbarian's turn as dozens of small cuts open across their flesh. Neutral creatures that are adjacent to the barbarian are shaken, but do not take any damage. Evil creatures are unaffected. A barbarian must have the fiend totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

_Fiend Totem, Lesser (Su)_: While raging, the barbarian grows a pair of large horns, gaining a gore attack.

The gore attack deals 1d8 points of piercing damage (1d6 if Small) plus the barbarian's Strength modifier (1/2 if it is a secondary attack).

_Flesh Wound (Ex)_: Once per rage, the barbarian can try to avoid serious harm from an attack. The barbarian must make a Fortitude save with a DC equal to the damage that would be dealt by the attack. The barbarian's armor check penalty applies on this saving throw. If the save succeeds, the barbarian takes half damage from the attack and the damage is nonlethal. The barbarian must elect to use this ability after the attack roll is made, but before the damage is rolled. A barbarian must be at least 10th level to select this rage power.

_Good for What Ails You (Ex)_: While raging, the barbarian who takes a drink of alcohol may attempt a new saving throw against one of the following conditions that may be affecting her: blinded, confused, dazzled, deafened, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, or sickened. If she succeeds at the save, the effect is suppressed for the duration of the rage. She also may attempt a new saving throw if poisoned; a successful save counts against those required for a cure, but a failed save has no ill effect.

_Ground Breaker (Ex)_: Once per rage, the barbarian can attack the floor around her as a standard action. This attack automatically hits and deals damage normally. If the barbarian manages to deal more damage than the floor's hardness, the space she occupies and all of the squares adjacent to her become difficult terrain. Creatures in these squares, except the barbarian, must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be knocked prone. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

_Hurling, Lesser (Ex)_: As a full-round action while raging, the barbarian can lift and hurl an object up to one size category smaller than herself with both hands or two size categories smaller with one hand as an improvised weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. This inflicts damage as a falling object (_Core Rulebook_ 443) plus the barbarian's Strength bonus. This damage is halved if the object is not made of stone, metal, or similar material. This is a ranged touch attack, and the target may attempt a Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 the barbarian's level + the barbarian's Strength modifier) for half damage. The barbarian may apply [Power Attack](../../feats.md#_power-attack) to this attack as a one- or two-handed weapon, as appropriate.

_Hurling Charge (Ex)_: While raging and making a charge attack, the barbarian may draw and throw a hurled weapon during her charge, gaining the normal +2 attack roll bonus on the thrown weapon attack as well as on the melee attack at the end of the charge. The barbarian must move at least 10 feet before using a thrown weapon and at least 10 additional feet before making a melee attack at the end of her charge.

A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

_Spirit Totem (Su)_: While raging, the spirits that surround the barbarian make it difficult for her enemies to see her.

A barbarian must have the lesser spirit totem rage power to select this rage power. A barbarian must be at least 6th level to select this rage power.

# Breaker

While most barbarians are skilled at breaking things, some find the need to destroy their surroundings an almost uncontrollable urge when in the middle of a rage. These barbarians are a danger not only to their foes, but also to the very environment around them. A breaker barbarian has the following class features.

**Destructive (Ex)** : Whenever the breaker barbarian makes a melee attack that targets an unattended object or makes a sunder combat maneuver, she adds half her barbarian level (minimum +1) on the damage roll. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Battle Scavenger (Ex)** : At 3rd level, the breaker barbarian suffers no penalty on attack rolls when using an improvised weapon or a weapon with the broken condition. In addition, she gains a +1 bonus on damage rolls with improvised or broken weapons for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the breaker archetype: ground breaker, smasher, and strength surge\*.

# Brutal Pugilist

Some barbarians focus on using their bare hands to tear their opponents limb from limb. These brutal pugilists also learn a great deal about various combat maneuvers, using them to cripple or crush their foes. A brutal pugilist has the following class features.

**Savage Grapple (Ex)** : At 2nd level, the brutal pugilist takes only half the normal penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She can make an attack of opportunity against creatures trying to grapple her even if they possess the [Improved Grapple](../../feats.md#_improved-grapple) feat or the grab special attack. If she hits with this attack of opportunity, she gains a +2 circumstance bonus to her CMD against the grapple attempt. She cannot make these attacks of opportunity once a grapple has succeeded. This ability replaces uncanny dodge.

**Pit Fighter (Ex)** : At 3rd level, the brutal pugilist has learned combat tricks from fighting in pit brawls and gladiatorial arenas. She selects one combat maneuver and gains a +1 insight bonus on her CMB or to her CMD in that maneuver. This bonus increases to +2 if the barbarian is wearing no armor (shields are allowed). At every three levels after 3rd, the barbarian may select another combat maneuver and add this bonus on her CMB or to her CMD. This bonus can be applied to each maneuver no more than twice, once on CMB and once to CMD. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Improved Savage Grapple (Ex)** : At 5th level, the brutal pugilist takes no penalties to Dexterity, attack rolls, and combat maneuver checks when she has the grappled condition. She also is treated as one size larger than her actual size when determining whether she can be grappled using the grab ability or swallowed by another creature. This ability replaces improved uncanny dodge.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the brutal pugilist archetype: animal fury\*, brawler, greater brawler, knockback\*, knockdown, overbearing advance, overbearing onslaught, and strength surge\*.

# Drunken Brute

Barbarians are known for their ability to consume potent drink, but drunken brutes turn drinking into a combat tactic, using the potent liquor to fuel their rage and grant them additional powers. A drunken brute has the following class feature.

**Raging Drunk (Ex)** : While raging, the drunken brute can drink a potion, or a tankard of ale or similar quantity of alcohol, as a move action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity. A potion has its normal effect, while an alcoholic drink allows the barbarian to maintain her rage that round without expending a round of rage for the day (instead of the alcohol's normal effects). For each alcoholic drink consumed while raging, the barbarian is nauseated for 1 round when her rage expires, in addition to the normal fatigue that follows a rage. Tireless rage does not negate this nauseated condition but the internal fortitude rage power does. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the drunken brute archetype: boasting taunt, good for what ails you, internal fortitude\*, liquid courage, moment of clarity\*, roaring drunk, and staggering drunk.

# Elemental Kin

Some barbarian tribes have strong ties to the elemental forces of nature. Their shamans anoint the warriors at birth, tying them to the patron element of the tribe and granting them lasting boons against such forces. An elemental kin has the following class feature.

**Elemental Fury (Ex)** : At 3rd level, whenever the elemental kin takes an amount of energy damage equal to or greater than her barbarian level while raging, she adds 1 to the total number of rounds that she can rage that day. At 6th level, and every three levels thereafter, the number of extra rounds per energy attack increases by +1, to a maximum of +6 rounds per energy attack at at 18th level. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the elemental kin archetype: elemental rage, energy absorption, energy eruption, energy resistance, greater elemental rage, greater energy resistance, and lesser elemental rage.

# Hurler

A raging barbarian is frightening enough in melee, but some become skilled at throwing objects at their foes before closing in for the kill. A hurler has the following class feature.

**Skilled Thrower (Ex)** : The hurler is skilled at throwing objects in combat. Increase the range increment of any thrown weapon or object by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the hurler archetype: hurling, greater hurling, hurling charge, lesser hurling, strength surge\*, and surprise accuracy\*.

# Invulnerable Rager

Some barbarians learn to take whatever comes their way, shrugging off mortal wounds with ease. These barbarians invite their enemies to attack them, and use pain to fuel their rage. An invulnerable rager has the following class features.

**Invulnerability (Ex)** : At 2nd level, the invulnerable rager gains DR/— equal to half her barbarian level. This damage reduction is doubled against nonlethal damage. This ability replaces uncanny dodge, improved uncanny dodge, and damage reduction.

**Extreme Endurance (Ex)** : At 3rd level, the invulnerable rager is inured to either hot or cold climate effects (choose one) as if using _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. In addition, the barbarian gains 1 point of fire or cold resistance for every three levels beyond 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the invulnerable rager archetype: come and get me, guarded life, increased damage reduction\*, inspire ferocity, reckless abandon, and renewed vigor\*.

# Mounted Fury

Many barbarian tribes are masters of the horse, teaching their members how to ride from a young age. As a result, barbarians from such tribes are even more terrifying when mounted, using their steeds' speed and strength to great advantage. A mounted fury has the following class features.

**Fast Rider (Ex)** : The speed of any mount the barbarian rides is increased by 10 feet. This ability replaces fast movement.

**Bestial Mount (Ex)** : At 5th level, the mounted fury gains the service of a feral mount. This ability functions as a druid's animal companion, using the barbarian's level –4 as her effective druid level. This companion must be one that she is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium barbarian can select a camel or a horse. A Small barbarian can select a pony or a wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if she is at least 8th level. Whenever a barbarian is raging while mounted on her bestial mount, the mount gains a +2 morale bonus to its Strength. This ability replaces uncanny dodge and improved uncanny dodge.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the mounted fury archetype: ferocious mount, ferocious trample, greater ferocious mount, greater ferocious trample, and spirit steed.

# Savage Barbarian

Some barbarians are truly savage, having little training in modern arms. These savage barbarians learn to avoid blows and toughen up their skin. A savage barbarian has the following class features.

**Naked Courage (Ex)** : At 3rd level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 dodge bonus to AC and a +1 morale bonus on saving throws against fear when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every six levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Natural [Toughness](../../feats.md#_toughness) (Ex)** : At 7th level, the savage barbarian gains a +1 natural armor bonus to AC when wearing no armor (shields are allowed). This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels beyond 7th. This ability replaces damage reduction.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the savage barbarian archetype: flesh wound, guarded stance\*, increased damage reduction\*, intimidating glare\*, rolling dodge\*, superstition\*, and terrifying howl\*.

# Superstitious

Many barbarians distrust magic. While most just shy away from magic, others focus their rage on users of such foul arts. These barbarians are naturally distrusting, and develop keen senses to protect them from harm. A superstitious barbarian has the following class features.

**Sixth Sense (Ex)** : At 3rd level, the superstitious barbarian gains a +1 bonus on initiative and a +1 insight bonus to AC during surprise rounds. This bonus increases by +1 for every three levels after 3rd. This ability replaces trap sense.

**Keen Senses (Ex)** : At 7th level, the superstitious barbarian gains low-light vision (triple normal vision range in dim light if she already has low-light vision). At 10th level, she gains darkvision 60 feet (or adds 60 feet to the range of any darkvision already possessed). At 13th level, she gains scent. At 16th level, she gains blindsense 30 feet. At 19th level, she gains blindsight 30 feet. This ability replaces damage reduction.

**Rage Powers** : The following rage powers complement the superstitious archetype: clear mind\*, disruptive, roused anger\*, spellbreaker, superstition\*, and witch hunter.

# Totem Warrior

A barbarian often has a special totem that is the patron of her tribe. While individual totems vary, those in the tribe that call upon a totem receive similar abilities. Totem warrior barbarians can select from the following rage powers.

**Rage Powers** : The totem warrior is based entirely upon his totem rage powers. In addition to the totem powers themselves, the following rage powers complement the totem warrior archtype (depending on the totem chosen): animal fury\*, low-light vision\*, night vision\*, raging climber\*, raging leaper\*, raging swimmer\*, and swift foot\*.
