# Sorcerer

Filled with magical power that screams for release, sorcery is not so much a calling as a blessing—or a curse. For some sorcerers, this arcane birthright manifests in subtle and carefully controlled ways, assisting in their manipulation of others or the pursuit of lofty goals. For others, it is wild and unpredictable, the primal and explosive lashing out of a power greater than themselves. Presented below are a number of new bloodlines representing the mysterious origin of your sorcerer's abilities.

New spells presented in Chapter 5 are marked here with asterisks (\*).

# Aquatic

Your family traces its heritage back to the ocean depths, whether scions of undersea empires left in the wake of nomadic sea-tribes, or the spawn of creeping ichthyic infiltrators into remote seaside villages. The song of the sea hums in your blood, calling the waves and all those within to your command.

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell of the water type, your effective caster level is increased by one, and summoned creatures with a swim speed or the aquatic or water type gain a +1 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls.

**Bloodline Powers** : Your seaborn magical talents awaken changes in you, both mystical and physical, as you develop your powers.

_Dehydrating Touch (Sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can make a melee touch attack as a standard action that inflicts 1d6 points of nonlethal damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess and sickens the target for 1 round.

This ability is telepathic and does not require audible or visual components. At 15th level, once per day you can telepathically call and request a service from an aquatic, water, or swimming creature as if using _ [demand](../../spells/demand#_demand) _or _ [greater planar ally](../../spells/planarAlly#_planar-ally-greater)_.

_Raise the Deep (Sp)_: At 15th level, you raise water as per _ [control water](../../spells/controlWater#_control-water)_, but no water need be present.

At 20th level, the dimensions of the effect are doubled. You may use this ability once per day.

_Deep One (Ex)_: At 20th level, you gain blindsense 60 feet and your body is covered with fine, slippery scales granting DR 10/piercing, resist cold 20, and continuous _ [freedom of movement](../../spells/freedomOfMovement#_freedom-of-movement)_. Underwater, you gain evasion and blindsight 120 feet, and you are immune to pressure damage from deep water.

# Boreal

Descended from inhabitants of the lands of ice and snow, you count among your ancestors giant-kin, troll-born, and frost-rimed spirits.

In addition, you can surround yourself with a cloak of swirling snow for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level. This power acts and deals damage as a _ [fire shield](../../spells/fireShield#_fire-shield) (chill [shield](../../spells/shield#_shield))_ that sheds no light. It provides a 20% miss chance on attacks made against you and grants a bonus on [Stealth](../../skills/stealth#_stealth) checks equal to 1/2 your sorcerer level in snowy or icy areas. You can use this ability once per day at 9th level, twice per day at 17th, and three times per day at 20th.

_Blizzard (Sp)_: At 15th level, you can create a savage winter storm centered on you. This power acts as _ [control winds](../../spells/controlWinds#_control-winds)_, but in addition the entire area (not including the “eye” at the center of the storm) is affected as a _ [sleet storm](../../spells/sleetStorm#_sleet-storm)_ and all in the area are exposed to [extreme cold](../../environment#_cold-dangers). You may use this ability once per day.

_Child of Ancient Winters (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the cold subtype and you become immune to fatigue and exhaustion. In addition, you gain immunity to sneak attacks and critical hits. This power causes you to gain vulnerability to fire.

# Deep Earth

The echoing cave-songs and the rumble and creak of primal spirits deep below the ground thrum in your soul and in all your family line. You are likely slow, steady, and stable in your thinking, little prone to wandering and preferring to instead find depth in contemplation.

_Tremor (Sp)_: At 1st level, as a standard action, you can cause the ground to shake beneath a single creature within 30 feet, functioning as a trip maneuver using your sorcerer level plus your Charisma modifier in place of your CMB. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Rockseer (Su)_: At 3rd level, you gain the stonecunning trait as a dwarf; if already a dwarf, your bonus improves to +4. At 9th level, you gain tremorsense 30 feet. At 15th level, you can see through solid objects as if using a _ [ring of x-ray vision](../../magicItems/rings#_ring-of-x-ray-vision)_ for a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level.

_Earth [Glide](../spells/glide#_glide-) (Ex)_: At 15th level, you can glide through any sort of natural earth or stone as easily as a fish swims through water, with a burrow speed equal to half your normal speed. You do not leave a tunnel or trace of your passage. You can use this ability for 1 minute per sorcerer level each day. The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

_Strength of Stone (Su)_: At 20th level, your flesh becomes as hard as stone, giving you DR 10/adamantine, and you become immune to petrification. You suffer no penalties while squeezing through tight spaces and are immune to bull rush, drag, grapple, reposition, and trip maneuvers, and to push and pull effects as long as you are standing on the ground.

# Dreamspun

Your family is a long line of dreamers, who dream not as ordinary mortals do but rather as those who reach through and touch the supernal realm of dreams and the farthest shores of night. Whether it is a gift or curse is not always clear, but your visions of the past and future call you ineluctably to a life of adventure.

_Dreamshaper (Sp)_: At 9th level, you can manipulate the dreamscape of others, drawing forth or tampering with their subconscious minds. This power allows you to tamper with the target's memories as if using _ [modify memory](../../spells/modifyMemory#_modify-memory), _or you may ask questions as if using _ [speak with dead](../../spells/speakWithDead#_speak-with-dead) _upon a corpse. A successful Will save negates the effect. The DC of this save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier, with further modifiers as the _ [nightmare](../../spells/nightmare#_nightmare) _spell.

_Eye of Somnus (Sp)_: At 15th level, you can project your consciousness as if using _ [arcane eye](../../spells/arcaneEye#_arcane-eye)_. In addition, at any point you can cause the _ [arcane eye](../../spells/arcaneEye#_arcane-eye) _to become visible. The eye can no longer be moved, but it acts as a _ [symbol of sleep](../../spells/symbolOfSleep#_symbol-of-sleep) _to all who see it. You may use this power once per day.

_Solipsism (Ex)_: At 20th level, you can drift into the dream world, fading from the world around you. You can become incorporeal for 1 minute per sorcerer level.

The duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1-minute increments.

# Protean

You have in your veins the ever-changing wildness of primal chaos, the raw essence of unbound creation. Your mind and spirit burst with the constant inspiration of consummate freedom, though you have difficulty following through on a task when another, new and exciting, catches your interest.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [entropic shield](../../spells/entropicShield#_entropic-shield) _(3rd), _ [blur](../../spells/blur#_blur) _(5th), _ [gaseous form](../../spells/gaseousForm#_gaseous-form) _(7th), _ [confusion](../../spells/confusion#_confusion) _(9th), _ [major creation](../../spells/majorCreation#_major-creation) _(11th), _ [disintegrate](../../spells/disintegrate#_disintegrate) _(13th), _ [greater polymorph](../../spells/polymorph#_polymorph-greater) _(15th), _ [polymorph any object](../../spells/polymorphAnyObject#_polymorph-any-object) _(17th), _ [shapechange](../../spells/shapechange#_shapechange) _(19th).

**Bloodline Powers** : Your ancestral immersion in primordial chaos begets your curiously warped magical talents.

_Protoplasm (Sp)_: At 1st level, you can create a ball of entropic protoplasm and hurl it at targets within 30 feet.

You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Protean Resistances (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain resist acid 5 and a +2 bonus on saving throws against polymorph, petrification, and transmutation spells or effects. At 9th level, you gain resist acid 10 and your save bonus increases to +4.

Attacks from outside the aura suffer a 20% miss chance against targets inside the aura. You may use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your sorcerer level, though this duration need not be continuous.

_Spatial Tear (Sp)_: At 15th level, once per day, you can unravel the fibers of reality and ride along them as they snap back into place. This power functions as _ [dimension door](../../spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door), _while also creating a mass of _ [black tentacles](../../spells/blackTentacles#_black-tentacles) _centered on your former location. Both of these effects use your sorcerer level as the caster level. At 20th level, you can use this ability twice per day.

_Avatar of Chaos (Ex)_: At 20th level, you are infused with the essence of raw chaos. You gain immunity to acid, petrification, and polymorph effects (except when cast on self), as well as a +2 bonus to save DCs and on checks to overcome spell penetration against creatures with the lawful subtype.

# Serpentine

Your bloodline carries the lingering stain of ancient serpent races that ruled when the world was young; your forebears were likely favored slaves anointed by their reptilian masters and gifted with their cold cunning and subtle manipulation. While deception and a mesmeric charm are your birthright, you may struggle for truth in spite of your heritage.

**Class Skill** : [Diplomacy](../../skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Your powers of compulsion can affect even bestial creatures. Whenever you cast a mind-affecting or language-dependent spell, it affects animals, magical beasts, and monstrous humanoids as if they were humanoids who understood your language.

**Bloodline Powers** : The treacherous and yet hypnotic serpent's blood that flows through you taints your magic with a sinuous and seductive grace.

_Serpent's Fang (Ex)_: At 1st level, you can grow fangs as a free action. These fangs are treated as a natural weapon inflicting 1d4 points of damage plus your Strength modifier (1d3 if you are Small) plus poison (Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Constitution modifier; _frequency _1/round for 6 rounds; _effect _1 Con damage; _cure _1 save). At 5th level, these fangs are considered magical for the purpose of overcoming DR and the poison damage increases to 1d2 Con. At 7th level, your poison requires 2 successful saves to cure. At 11th level, your poison damage increases to 1d4 Con. You can use your fangs for a number of rounds per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Serpentfriend (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you can use _ [speak with animals](../../spells/speakWithAnimals#_speak-with-animals) _at will with reptilian animals (including various forms of dinosaurs, lizards, and other cold-blooded creatures), and you gain a viper familiar using your sorcerer level –2 as your effective wizard level.

_Snakeskin (Ex)_: At 9th level, you gain a +1 bonus to natural armor, a +2 racial bonus on saves against poison, and a +2 bonus on [Escape Artist](../../skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) checks. At 13th level and 17th level, these bonuses increase by +1.

_Den of Vipers (Sp)_: At 15th level, you may summon a host of writhing serpents. This power acts as _ [creeping doom](../../spells/creepingDoom#_creeping-doom), _but the swarms' poison inflicts Con damage and any creature other than you sharing a space with a swarm is entangled.

_Scaled Soul (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the shapechanger subtype, and you can assume the form of a reptilian humanoid (as _ [alter self](../../spells/alterSelf#_alter-self)_) or snake of Diminutive to Huge size (as _ [beast shape III](../../spells/beastShape#_beast-shape-iii)_) at will. You retain the power of speech and the ability to use somatic spell components when transformed. You also become immune to poison and paralysis. You may use serpent's fang as often as desired, and you may choose to inflict damage to any ability score.

# Shadow

Spirits from the shadow plane dally at times in the world of light, and such as these lay with your ancestors once upon a time, imparting the mystery of shadow-stuff into your lineage.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Nighteye (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain darkvision 30 feet. At 9th level, you gain darkvision 60 feet. If you already possess darkvision, its range is increased by these amounts.

In addition, when within an area of darkness or dim light, as a standard action you may choose to switch places with a willing ally within 60 feet, who must also be in darkness or dim light. At 13th level, you can instead switch the positions of two willing allies, each of whom must be within 60 feet of you. Unless otherwise noted, this travel is identical to _ [dimension door](../../spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door)_. You may use the ability to switch places once per day at 9th level, plus one additional time per day at 17th level and 20th level.

_Enveloping Darkness (Sp)_: At 15th level, you may create an area of _ [deeper darkness](../../spells/deeperDarkness#_deeper-darkness)_ that you can see through without penalty.

You may use this ability once per day.

_ [Shadow](../../magicItems/armor#_armor-shadow) Master (Su)_: At 20th level, you can see perfectly in natural or magical darkness.
