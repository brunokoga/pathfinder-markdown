# Druid

Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself, druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need answer only to the wind and the rain.

Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans who worship specific totem animals.

# Aquatic Druid

Shepherds of the lakes and seas, aquatic druids guard ecosystems ranging from shallows streams to deep ocean trenches, ministering to their residents and communing with the tides.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)** : An aquatic druid's wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype; however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.

**Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)** : At 2nd level, an aquatic druid gains an insight bonus on Initiative checks and [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival), and [Swim](../../skills/swim.md#_swim) checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in aquatic terrain, and she cannot be tracked such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Natural Swimmer (Ex)** : At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim speed equal to half her land speed. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Resist Ocean's Fury (Ex)** : At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level – 2.

**Seaborn (Ex)** : At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed. She also can endure cold climate effects as if using _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Deep Diver (Ex)** : At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., _ [black tentacles](../../spells/blackTentacles.md#_black-tentacles)_, _ [crushing hand](../../spells/crushingHand.md#_crushing-hand)_). She never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Arctic Druid

An arctic druid watches over the stark landscape of the far frozen reaches of the world, tending the stunted and rugged life that ekes out its survival in the least habitable climes.

**Arctic Native (Ex)** : At 2nd level, an arctic druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in cold or icy terrain, and she cannot be tracked in cold or icy terrain. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Icewalking (Ex)** : At 3rd level, an arctic druid suffers no penalty to speed or on [Acrobatics](../../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics), [Climb](../../skills/climb.md#_climb), or [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Arctic Endurance (Ex)** : At 4th level, an arctic druid ignores the effects of a cold climate as if using _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. She is also immune to being dazzled. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : An arctic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level – 2.

**Snowcaster (Su)** : At 9th level, an arctic druid can see normally in _ [ice storm](../../spells/iceStorm.md#_ice-storm)_, _ [sleet storm](../../spells/sleetStorm.md#_sleet-storm)_, or similar natural snowstorms. In addition, she can prepare any druid spell with the fire subtype as a cold spell, with an identical effect but inflicting cold damage instead of fire damage. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Flurry Form (Ex)** : At 13th level, an arctic druid can assume the form of a swirling column of snow equivalent to _ [gaseous form](../../spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)_ at will. While in this form, she gains a circumstance bonus on [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks made in cold terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Blight Druid

The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster. While some are devoted to reforming and reclaiming lands despoiled by the ravages of civilization, others seek out the more rapacious violence inherent in nature and feed the creeping rot and decay that brings an end to all things.

**Nature Bond (Ex)** : A blight druid may not bond with an animal companion, but may either call a familiar as a wizard of her druid level or select from the Darkness, Death, and Destruction domains in addition to those normally available.

**Vermin Empathy (Su)** : A blight druid can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly. The blight druid can also improve the attitude of animals and mindless undead creatures that were formerly animals, but she takes a –4 penalty on the check unless the animal or undead has a disease special attack. This ability replaces wild empathy.

**Miasma (Ex)** : Starting at 5th level, if a blight druid is adjacent to a creature at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level + the druid's Wisdom modifier or become sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours, as are creatures immune to disease. This ability replaces trackless step and resist nature's lure.

**Blightblooded (Ex)** : At 9th level, a blight druid gains immunity to all diseases, including natural and supernatural diseases. She also becomes immune to effects that would cause her to become sickened or nauseated. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Plaguebearer (Su)** : Starting at 13th level, any creature that strikes a blight druid with a touch attack, unarmed strike, or natural weapon must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level + the druid's Wisdom modifier or contract a disease, as the _ [contagion](../../spells/contagion.md#_contagion)_ spell. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Cave Druid

Far from the green fields of the world above lies a lightless expanse beneath the surface. This darkling fairyland is not without beauty and natural wonders of its own, and a few druids seek to preserve this hidden realm and purge it of the fell horrors that creep up from below.

**Cavesense (Ex)** : A underground druid adds [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (dungeoneering) rather than [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (dungeoneering) and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) skill checks. This ability replaces the nature sense ability.

**Nature Bond** : A cave druid may select the Darkness domain in addition to the choices normally allowed, but may not select the Air or Weather domains.

**Wild Empathy (Ex)** : A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than magical beasts, with a –4 penalty on her wild empathy check.

**Tunnelrunner (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a cave druid can move through areas of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at her normal movement rate and without penalty. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Lightfoot (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a cave druid cannot be detected with tremorsense. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex)** : At 4th level, a cave druid gains a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level – 2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze as if using _ [beast shape III](../../spells/beastShape.md#_beast-shape-iii)_, and at 12th level that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using _ [beast shape IV](../../spells/beastShape.md#_beast-shape-iv) _(treating the ooze as if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.

# Desert Druid

Not all climates are verdant paradises, but even in the sere deserts there is life—though often hidden from the sun and rarely friendly—and raw, desolate beauty. Here desert druids come to pay homage, protect and maintain the few habitable locales, and witness nature's majesty in all its burning, merciless glory.

**Desert Native (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a desert druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in desert terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Sandwalker (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a desert druid suffers no penalty to speed or on [Acrobatics](../../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) or [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks when moving through sandy or desert terrain. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Desert Endurance (Ex)** : At 4th level, a desert druid ignores the effects of a hot climate as if using _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. She also has a reduced need to eat and drink, as if wearing a _ [ring of sustenance](../../magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-sustenance)_ (though normal sleep is still required). This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : A desert druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level – 2. A desert druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level she can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin, at 12th level a Tiny or Large vermin, and at 14th level a Diminutive or Huge vermin. This effect functions as _ [beast shape IV](../../spells/beastShape.md#_beast-shape-iv)_ (treating the vermin as an animal to determine its ability and natural armor modifiers).

**Shaded Vision (Ex)** : At 9th level, a desert druid becomes immune to blinding and dazzling effects and gains a +2 bonus on saving throws against gaze attacks and illusions of the figment and pattern subschools. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Dunemeld (Ex)** : At 13th level, a desert druid can assume the form of a swirling mass of sand at will. This is equivalent to _ [gaseous form](../../spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)_, but the druid gains a land and burrow speed of 10 feet rather than a fly speed. While in this form, the druid gains a circumstance bonus on [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks made in desert terrain equal to her druid level. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Jungle Druid

The fecund jungles of the equatorial regions are rich in life and ancient tradition; druidical guardians of sacred pools, elder trees, and trembling volcanoes watch over crumbling temples and the inevitable reclamation of lost civilizations by the beating heart of nature untamed.

**Jungle Guardian (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a jungle druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and [Climb](../../skills/climb.md#_climb), [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in jungle terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such environments. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Woodland Stride (Ex)** : A jungle druid gains this ability at 3rd level. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Torrid Endurance (Ex)** : At 4th level, a jungle druid ignores the effects of a hot climate as if under the effects of _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. She also gains a +4 bonus on saves against disease and the exceptional abilities of animals and magical beasts. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : A jungle druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level – 2.

**Verdant Sentinel (Ex)** : At 13th level, a jungle druid can cast_ [tree shape](../../spells/treeShape.md#_tree-shape)_ at will. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Mountain Druid

As more and more of the soft, easy lands become cultivated and civilized, many druids look for refuge and solitude among the eternal peaks of the highest mountains.

**Mountaineer (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a mountain druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and [Climb](../../skills/climb.md#_climb), [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) checks equal to half her druid level in mountainous terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such an environment. This ability replaces woodland stride.

**Sure-Footed (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a mountain druid suffers no penalty to speed or on [Acrobatics](../../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) or [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks when walking across steep slopes, rubble, or scree. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Spire Walker (Ex)** : At 4th level, a mountain druid does not lose her Dexterity bonus when climbing. A mountain druid is immune to altitude sickness and ignores the effects of a cold climate as if under the effects of _ [endure elements](../../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : A mountain druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level – 2. A mountain druid cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. However, at 12th level she can assume the form of a Large giant as if using _ [giant form I](../../spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-i)_. At 16th level, she may assume the form of a Huge giant as if using _ [giant form II](../../spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-ii)_.

This does not protect her against being tripped, grappled, or overrun. This ability replaces venom immunity.

**Mountain Stone (Ex)** : At 13th level, a mountain druid can transform her body into a weathered stone outcrop and back at will. This effect functions as _ [statue](../../spells/statue.md#_statue)_. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

# Plains Druid

Out upon the wide and rolling prairies and savannahs, plains druids stand guard over the grasslands. These druids range far and wide, watching over nomadic tribes and wandering herds and preserving the sometimes fragile ecosystem of the wide open spaces.

**Plains Traveler (Ex)** : At 2nd level, a plains druid gains a bonus on initiative checks and [Knowledge](../../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (geography), [Perception](../../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth), and [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in plains terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such an environment.

**Run Like the Wind (Ex)** : At 3rd level, a plains druid gains +10 feet to her land speed when wearing light or no armor and carrying a light load, and once per hour, she may run or charge at double the normal speed for 1 round. If riding her animal companion, it gains this ability instead. This ability replaces trackless step.

**Savanna Ambush (Ex)** : At 4th level, a plains druid gains concealment whenever she is prone in natural surroundings, and can make [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks at no penalty when prone and not moving or at –5 when crawling.

**Spontaneous Casting** : An urban druid can channel stored spell energy into domain spells that she has not prepared ahead of time. She can “lose” a prepared spell in order to cast any domain spell of the same level or lower. This ability replaces the ability to spontaneously cast summon nature's ally spells.

# Animal Shamans

Some druids form a close bond with one type of animal. The following animal shamans represent just some of the possibilities, exploring the unique bond between a druid and her totem. These shamans all possess similar powers, which are explained fully in the bear shaman description.

## Bear Shaman

While using totem transformation, the bear shaman may speak normally and can cast _ [speak with animals](../../spells/speakWithAnimals.md#_speak-with-animals)_ (mammals only) at will. Using this ability is a standard action at 2nd level, a move action at 7th level, and a swift action at 12th level. The bear shaman can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to her druid level. These minutes do not need to be consecutive, but they must be used in 1-minute increments. This is a polymorph effect and cannot be used while the druid is using another polymorph effect, such as wild shape.

**Totemic Summons (Su)** : At 5th level, a bear shaman may cast _summon nature's ally_ as a standard action when summoning bears, and summoned bears gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. She can apply the young template to any bear to reduce the level of the summoning spell required by one. She can also increase the level of summoning required by one in order to apply either the advanced or the giant template, or increase it by two to apply both the advanced and giant templates. This ability replaces a thousand faces.

She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.

## Serpent Shaman

A shaman with this totem calls upon the cunning serpent, the stealthy deceiver who draws the weak minded in and strikes while they are unaware. Some hate its treacherous nature, while others praise its thoughtful pragmatism.

She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.

## Wolf Shaman

A shaman with this totem calls upon the clever wolf, capable of roaming alone yet wise enough to run with a pack when facing dangers too great for one alone.

**Nature Bond** : A wolf shaman who chooses an animal companion must select a wolf. If choosing a domain, the wolf shaman must choose from the Animal, Community, Liberation, and Travel domains.

**Totem Transformation (Su)** : At 2nd level, a wolf shaman may adopt an aspect of the wolf while retaining her normal form. This ability functions as the bear shaman ability, but the druid may select from the following bonuses: movement (+20 enhancement bonus to land speed), senses (low-light vision, scent, +4 racial bonus to [Survival](../../skills/survival.md#_survival) when tracking by scent), or natural weapons (bite [1d4 plus trip] for a Medium druid, +2 CMB to trip). While using totem transformation, the wolf shaman may speak normally and can cast _ [speak with animals](../../spells/speakWithAnimals.md#_speak-with-animals)_ (canines only) at will.

**Totemic Summons (Su)** : At 5th level, a wolf shaman may cast _summon nature's ally_ as a standard action when summoning canines, and these summoned creatures gain temporary hit points equal to her druid level. This ability otherwise functions as the bear shaman ability.

**Wild Shape (Su)** : At 6th level, a wolf shaman's wild shape ability functions at her druid level – 2. If she takes on the form of a canine, she instead uses her druid level + 2.

**Bonus Feat** : At 9th level and every 4 levels thereafter, a wolf shaman gains one of the following bonus feats: [Greater Trip](../../feats.md#_greater-trip), [Improved Trip](../../feats.md#_improved-trip), [Mobility](../../feats.md#_mobility), [Skill Focus](../../feats.md#_skill-focus) ( [Stealth](../../skills/stealth.md#_stealth)), or [Spring Attack](../../feats.md#_spring-attack). She must meet the prerequisites for these bonus feats. This ability replaces venom immunity.
