# Spells

Beyond the spells presented in the _Core Rulebook_ exist countless more mystical discoveries and the secret tricks of spellcasters arcane and divine. The following lists summarize all of the new spells presented in this book, broken down by class. Note that, with the exception of the antipaladin's full spell list, the lists here summarize only new spells from this book. An **M** or **F** appearing at the end of a spell's name in the spell lists denotes a _material_ or _focus_ component, respectively, not normally included in a spell component pouch.

**Full Spell Lists** : The full lists of available spells for the spellcasting base classes introduced in this book appear in Chapter Two at the end of each spellcasting class's entry. Note that oracles use the same spell list as clerics.

**Order of Presentation** : In the spell lists and the short descriptions that follow them, the spells are presented in alphabetical order by name except for those belonging to certain spell chains. When a spell's name begins with “lesser,” “greater,” or “mass,” the spell is alphabetized under the second word of the spell name instead.

**Hit Dice** : The term “Hit Dice” is used synonymously with “character levels” for effects that affect a specific number of Hit Dice of creatures.

**Caster Level** : A spell's power often depends on caster level, which is defined as the caster's class level for the purpose of casting a particular spell. The word “level” in the short descriptions that follow always refers to caster level.

**Creatures and Characters** : “Creature” and “character” are used synonymously in the short description.
