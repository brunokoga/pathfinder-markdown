# Prestige Classes 

Prestige classes represent specializations not available to most adventurers, the culmination of extensive practice in a specific field or discipline. The eight prestige classes here supplement those found in Chapter 11 of the _Core Rulebook_. Always check with your GM to make sure a given prestige class is allowed before working toward it.
