Special Abilities

**Martial Proficiency (Ex)** Sinspawn are proficient in all simple and martial weapons, armor, and shields (except tower shields).

**Sin-Scent (Su)** Sinspawn have [scent](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_scent) against creatures whose nature reflects the sinspawn's sin. For example, wrathful sinspawn can [scent](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_scent) creatures using rage effects. The GM should adjudicate what creatures a particular sinspawn can [scent](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_scent).

**Sinful Bite (Su)** A creature bitten by a sinspawn is overwhelmed with sinful thoughts (DC 12 Will save negates). These emotions are so powerful that the target becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes. An affected target that is bitten a second time is staggered for 1 round if it fails its saving throw. _ [Calm emotions](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/calmEmotions.html#_calm-emotions)_, _ [remove curse](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse)_, or_ [break enchantment](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/breakEnchantment.html#_break-enchantment)_ negates the effects of sinful bite. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is a mind-affecting effect.

Sinspawn are corrupted products of magic used by spellcasters in a past era as shock troops for their armies. Literally the embodiment of a sin made flesh, they are sentient abominations of distilled ectoplasm imprinted with the soul-image of slain creatures that possessed an abundance of a particular sin.
