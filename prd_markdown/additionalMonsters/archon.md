Special Abilities

**Spear and Shield (Su)** At will as a free action, a shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) can transform his hands into a _+1 tower [shield](additionalMonsters/../spells/shield#_shield)_ and a _+3 shortspear_, or either individually, or back to hands again. He cannot transform both hands into shields or both into shortspears. A shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) never takes the typical –2 penalty on attack rolls while wielding a tower shield. A shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype)'s weapons cannot be disarmed, but they can be sundered. If a shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) loses his spear or shield, he can manifest a new one as a full-round action. When a shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) is slain, these two items fade away—they cannot be looted or wielded by any other creature.

**Stability (Ex)** Shield archons receive a +4 racial bonus to CMD when resisting a bull rush or trip attempt.

**Transpose Ally (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) can teleport to the location of a willing (or unconscious) ally and immediately teleport that ally to the [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype)'s previous position, in effect switching places with the ally. The [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) must have line of effect to the target.

Shield archons are the mighty rocks of celestial armies, withstanding waves of demons and devils without complaint. Though more than capable of tearing apart lesser demons and devils, their true strength lies in their ability to shrug off deadly attacks from superior opponents, giving their offense-oriented allies time to flank and overwhelm their mutual foes. Shield archons are 9 feet tall and weigh 800 pounds.

# Archon, Star

Special Abilities

**Explosive Rebirth (Su)** When killed, a star [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) explodes in a blinding flash of energy that deals 50 points of damage (half [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype), half holy damage) to anything within 100 feet (Reflex DC 29 half). The save DC is Constitution-based. The slain [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype) reincarnates 1d4 rounds later as an advanced shield [archon](monsters/creatureTypes#_archon-subtype).

**Spells** Star archons cast divine spells as 19th-level clerics. They do not gain access to domains or other cleric abilities.

Star archons are the tacticians and strategists of Heaven. Gifted with insight and powerful magic, they spend much of their time steering long-term plans for Heaven's armies and good folk in the world.
