# Toad, Giant

Stubby warts dot the skin of this horse-sized brown toad. Its throat bulges and ripples as though about to croak.

Special Abilities

**[Poison](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_poison-(ex-or-su)) Skin (Ex)** A creature that strikes a giant toad with an unarmed strike or natural weapon exposes itself to the toad's poisonous skin.

Skin—contact; _save_ Fort DC 14; _frequency_ 1/round for 4 rounds; _effect_ 1d2 Wisdom damage; _cure_ 1 save.

Most giant toads live in dryer areas after maturing, returning to the water only to mate and give birth.

Giant toad companions are identical to giant frog companions (_Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_ 135), save that they lack the frog's tongue and pull abilities. Instead, they gain the poison skin ability at 4th level.

# Toad, Glacier

This improbably large toad has pale blue flesh and a body covered with jagged, icy growths.

Glacier toads are strange, magical cousins of the more common giant toads. None can say for certain whether they were bred, or evolved from exposure to elemental energies. Glacier toads have no practical use for most treasure, but have a fondness for shiny objects like gems and glowing items.
