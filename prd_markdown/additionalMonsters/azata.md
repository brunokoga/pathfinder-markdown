Special Abilities

**Flaming Body (Su)** A brijidine's body is molten rock covered in dancing flames. Anyone striking a brijidine with a natural weapon or unarmed strike takes 1d6 points of [fire](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_fire-subtype) damage. A creature that grapples a brijidine or is grappled by one takes 6d6 points of [fire](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_fire-subtype) damage each round the grapple persists.

**[Heat](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_heat) Stone (Su)** Whenever a brijidine uses her _ [meld into stone](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/meldIntoStone.html#_meld-into-stone)_, _ [soften](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/softenEarthAndStone.html#_soften-earth-and-stone) [earth](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_earth-subtype) and stone_, _ [spike stones](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/spikeStones.html#_spike-stones)_, _ [stone shape](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/stoneShape.html#_stone-shape)_, or _ [wall of stone](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../spells/wallOfStone.html#_wall-of-stone)_ spell-like abilities, she can have the affected stone radiate intense [heat](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_heat) for 1 minute. Any creature within 5 feet of the stone takes 1d6 [fire](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_fire-subtype) damage per round.

**Lava Blast (Su)** A brijidine can hurl a glob of lava at a target as a standard action. This attack has a range increment of 30 feet.

**Obsidian Blade (Ex)** At will as a free action, a brijidine can create a blade of jagged volcanic glass that functions as a_ +1 [flaming burst](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-flaming-burst) [keen](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-keen) longsword._ One round after it leaves the brijidine's grasp, the weapon decays into useless powder.

Brijidines are passionate, powerful azatas attuned to the powers of earth and fire. They love basking in volcanoes, writing poetry, tending to sick creatures, and pursuing spicy recipes. The quickest way to befriend a brijidine is to present her with a fireproof copy of an exotic poem or a bag of rare peppers. Though their power is tied to primal destruction, they are quick-witted and love clever wordplay, whether in a sonnet or a dirty limerick.

The brijidine sees fire as a form of purity, a marked difference from its classical association with devastation and destruction. To a brijidine, the existence of hellfire is the rankest blasphemy, and while many azatas look to the demons of the Abyss as their greatest enemies, it is among the devils of Hell that most brijidines find focus for their anger. The fact that devils are immune to fire, the brijidine's greatest strength, frustrates and angers these azatas all the more, forcing them to become far more imaginative and creative in their tactics when facing such foes. A brijidine stands 5-1/2 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.

Special Abilities

**Starlight Blast (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a lyrakien can tap into the divine power of Elysium, unleashing a blast of holy starlight in a 5-foot burst. All creatures in this area take 1d4 points of holy damage, plus 1 point for each step their alignment deviates from [chaotic](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_chaotic-subtype) [good](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_good-subtype). For example, a [chaotic](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_chaotic-subtype) neutral or neutral [good](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_good-subtype) creature would take 1d4+1 points of damage, a neutral creature would take 1d4+2 points of damage, and a [lawful](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_lawful-subtype) [evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_evil-subtype) creature would take 1d4+4 points of damage. A DC 12 Reflex save negates this damage. [Chaotic](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_chaotic-subtype) [good](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_good-subtype) creatures are unaffected by this ability. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Traveler's Friend (Su)** The performances and company of a lyrakien ease the burden of travel. Once per day, a creature may spend a minute listening to a lyrakien's performance—doing so removes the effects of exhaustion and fatigue from the listener.

Lyrakien are divine musicians and messengers, mainly in the employ of deities of travel and natural wonders. They love to explore and visit beautiful places, especially locations with excellent views of rainbows, moonlight, and the stars. Whimsical and joyous, they love contests of song, dance, and knowledge, and keep journeys happy by distracting their companions from weary feet and stale food. Mortals who please them with excellent tales and new songs may be rewarded with elaborate maps, forgotten shortcuts, or rambling directions to hidden locations that hold lost magic.

Lyrakien are light-hearted creatures, but they are very protective of breathtaking natural locations. Often called âglistenwingsâ by gnomes and halflings, lyrakien are frequently mistaken for fey—while they are generally friendly with true fey, their origin is the plane of Elysium. Like other azatas, they grow restless if they stay in one place too long. A chaotic good 7th-level spellcaster can gain a lyrakien as a familiar if she has the [Improved Familiar](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../feats.html#_improved-familiar) feat.
