Special Abilities

**Fireball Breath (Su)** A flame drake can, as a standard action, breathe a ball of flame that explodes like a _ [fireball](additionalMonsters/../spells/fireball.md#_fireball)_. This attack has a range of 180 feet and deals 5d6 points of [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) damage (DC 16 Reflex half) to all creatures within a 20-foot-radius spread. Once a flame drake has used its fireball breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Speed Surge (Ex)** Three times per day as a swift action, a flame drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

Flame drakes are the degenerate cousins of red dragons, with all of the rage and temper of true red dragons but little of the reason and intelligence. Flame drakes are brutal bullies who terrorize the lands they inhabit. From those they can frighten, flame drakes exact harsh tribute, and they viciously attack any not so easily cowed.

Flame drakes gather in small hunting packs called “rampages,” working together easily during raids but often falling prey to squabbling and infighting over the spoils. Males and females form their own packs divided by gender, coming together only during the annual mating season.

Flame drakes mate once a year. Males play no part in raising their offspring, and abandon their partners soon after mating. Females lay clutches of two or three eggs in secluded mountain nests, and raise their hatchlings for only 2 years before rejoining their packs and abandoning their offspring to their fates. Flame drakes mature in 5 years, and can live up to 150 years. They generally grow to 12 feet long and weigh 1,500 pounds.

# Drake, Forest

This green-scaled dragon has two powerful legs and a pair of long, leathery wings. A long spike adorns its thrashing tail.

Special Abilities

**Acidic Cloud (Su)** A forest drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of acid that bursts into a cloud on impact. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 4d6 points of acid damage (Reflex DC 14 half) to all creatures within the resulting 10-foot-radius spread. The cloud remains for 1d4 rounds once created, acting as a 10-foot-radius _ [obscuring mist](additionalMonsters/../spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)_ (it no longer causes damage), but a strong wind disperses it in a single round. Once a forest drake has used its acidic cloud breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.

**Aquatic Adaptation (Ex)** A forest drake can breathe underwater indefinitely and can freely use its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) and other abilities while underwater. The acidic cloud created by that attack dissipates after 1 round if used underwater.

**Speed Surge (Ex)** Three times per day as a swift action, a forest drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

Forest drakes are the degenerate cousins of green dragons, possessed of cruel cunning but little actual wit. Like most drakes, forest drakes are bullies, prowling deep forests in search of their favorite prey—elves and fey. Forest drakes eagerly attack communities of such forest creatures unless driven off with arrows or other shows of force.

Like many other drake types, forest drakes organize themselves in packs called “rampages,” and keep communal lairs in secluded forest locations. Such packs are usually made up of siblings who break from the pack only during mating season. A forest drake pack has a distinct pecking order, with younger and newer members receiving the least desirable portions of pack kills and the fewest mating options.

Forest drakes mate once a year, but do little to raise their offspring. A female lays a clutch of four to eight eggs, but abandons her young as soon as they hatch. Forest drake hatchlings immediately band together in a pack.

While few survive so long, forest drakes can live up to 200 years. Forest drakes are typically about 10 feet long with equally long tails, and weigh around 1,000 pounds.

# Drake, Frost

This two-legged dragon has dull blue scales tinged with bright blue ice. A freezing mist issues from between its powerful jaws.

Special Abilities

**Freezing Mist Breath (Su)** A frost drake can, as a standard action, spit a ball of liquid that bursts into a cloud of freezing mist. This attack has a range of 60 feet and deals 7d6 points of [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) damage (DC 18 Reflex half) to all creatures in a 20-foot-radius spread. The mist cakes all surfaces in the area with a sheet of slippery ice that turns the area into difficult terrain for 2d4 rounds, after which the ice cracks or melts enough to revert to the normal terrain features in the area. Once a frost drake has used its freezing mist breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.

**Icewalking (Ex)** This ability works like _ [spider climb](additionalMonsters/../spells/spiderClimb.md#_spider-climb)_, but the surfaces the drake climbs must be icy. It can move across icy surfaces without penalty and does not need to make [Acrobatics](additionalMonsters/../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks to run or charge on ice.

**Speed Surge (Ex)** Three times per day as a swift action, a frost drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

**Snow Vision (Ex)** A frost drake can see perfectly well in snowy conditions, and does not take any penalties on [Perception](additionalMonsters/../skills/perception.md#_perception) checks while in snow.

Degenerate cousins of white dragons, frost dragons are ferocious predators. They are larger than other drakes, reaching heights of up to 16 feet and weighing upward of 2,500 pounds. Their wide, clawed feet enable them to easily burrow through snow, though not through dirt or clay.

Young frost drakes form adolescent hunting packs divided along gender lines, but older frost drakes are usually encountered in mated pairs. Frost drakes mate for life, leaving their packs when they find a suitable mate. Mated pairs make a nest together, and the female lays a clutch of two to five eggs. Both parents care for their offspring when they hatch, and families usually form small packs until the young reach maturity at 5 years of age. At this point, the parents abandon their offspring, usually laying a new clutch of eggs in a new nest elsewhere, and leaving the fledgling drakes to find their own adolescent packs to join.

# Drake, Sea

Not quite sea serpent or dragon, this vicious beast is covered with shiny blue-green scales. Its arms serve as both wings and flippers.

Special Abilities

**Ball Lightning Breath (Su)** A sea drake can, as a standard action, breathe a ball of electricity that strikes one target first, then arcs to other targets like _ [chain lightning](additionalMonsters/../spells/chainLightning.md#_chain-lightning)_. This attack has a range of 100 feet, and deals 6d6 points of electricity damage (DC 17 Reflex half) to the primary target. After it strikes, the ball lightning can arc to a number of secondary targets equal to the sea drake's Hit Dice (usually 7) within 20 feet of the primary target. The secondary bolts each strike one target and deal as much damage as the primary bolt. Once a sea drake has used its ball lightning breath, it cannot do so again for 1d6 rounds. The Reflex save is Constitution-based.

**Capsize (Ex)** A sea drake can attempt to capsize a boat or ship of its size or smaller by ramming it as a charge attack and making a combat maneuver check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's [Profession](additionalMonsters/../skills/profession.md#_profession) (sailor) check, whichever is higher.

**Speed Surge (Ex)** Three times per day as a swift action, a sea drake may draw on its draconic heritage for a boost of strength and speed to take an additional move action in that round.

While obviously the product of draconic inbreeding, the heritage of sea drakes is less clear than that of other drakes. Among the strongest of the drakes, sea drakes still lack the mental acuity of their true dragon forebears, though they remain as brutally cunning as other drakes. Although amphibious, sea drakes spend the majority of their time in shallow coastal waters.

Sea drakes are up to 14 feet long from their noses to the tips of their powerful tails. They weigh 2,000 pounds.

The most solitary of all drakes, sea drakes prefer to hunt alone. Occasionally, however, they band together in packs to hunt larger prey. Such rampages can be a significant danger to coastal shipping.
