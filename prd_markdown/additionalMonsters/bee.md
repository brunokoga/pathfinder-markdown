**Vulnerable to Smoke (Ex)** Smoke from particularly smoky fires or effects (such as that created by a _ [pyrotechnics](additionalMonsters/../spells/pyrotechnics.md#_pyrotechnics)_ spell) causes a giant bee to become nauseated if it fails a DC 14 Fortitude save. This condition persists as long as the giant bee remains in the smoke, plus 1d4 rounds.

Like their smaller cousins, giant bees fill their ecological niche by playing matchmaker for a vast array of flowering plant life. As a giant bee feeds on plant nectars, clumps of pollen attach to the coarse hairs covering its body and legs.

Giant bees grow to approximately 5 feet in length, with a similar wingspan. These creatures weigh 60 pounds and live in their adult form for nearly 10 years. Giant bees' stingers are not barbed like those of their diminutive counterparts, so these creatures can sting foes repeatedly and do not die after one sting.

Giant Bumblebee (CR 2)

These bulky and aggressive giant bees have the advanced creature simple template. Their venom is deadly, and deals Constitution damage rather than Strength damage.

# Bee, Giant Queen

This giant bee is as large as a horse and unusually fat, with light brown stripes on her body.

Bulbous and robust in comparison to others of the same species, giant queen bees are immense, fertile females, easily identified by their larger size and lighter stripes. They grow to 12 feet in length and weigh 140 pounds.

## Royal Jelly

When a hive of bees needs a new queen to replace one that has died, they feed specially selected larvae royal jelly to trigger the larvae's transformation into new queens. The first queen to hatch then kills any other new queens.

Royal jelly has remarkable effects on other creatures if eaten. A pound of royal jelly provides enough nourishment for a full day, and grants a +4 resistance bonus on all saving throws against disease for the next 24 hours. If a creature sleeps enough to heal damage within 24 hours of eating at least a pound of royal jelly, it heals twice the hit points and ability damage as it otherwise would. A typical bee hive contains 2d6 pounds of royal jelly—a single pound sells for 100 gp.
