# Devil, Accuser

This childlike blasphemy conjoins the features of a plump human infant and a gigantic, gore-fattened fly.

**Infernal Eye (Su)** A zebub records all that it sees and may pass its visions on to another creature. By remaining in contact with a willing creature, it can replay up to 24 hours of witnessed events, or shorter incidents if it so chooses. It takes a zebub 1 round to replay 1 hour of recorded images, which the target receives in a flash of information, without sound or other sensory information. After relaying its findings, the zebub cannot replay its visions of those events again. A zebub cannot replay its visions for an unwilling creature or as an attack, no matter how horrific the events it might have witnessed.

[Childlike](additionalMonsters/../advanced/advancedFeats.md#_childlike) souls tormented and scoured of innocence by the flames of Hell and then reshaped by the mad whims of the archdevil Baalzebul, accuser devils embody the foul, merciless, and pervasive corruptions of the infernal host. From the depths of the Pit they rise in buzzing, shrieking plagues unleashed to taint the land, despoil weak flesh, and reveal exploitable secrets. En masse they display little of the cunning or subtlety typical of devilkind, spreading ruin at the will of their fiendish masters. Alone, though, a zebub is a craven, deceitful thing, lurking in darkness and filth, endlessly spying and vying for the petty favors of greater evils.

Accuser devils are almost exclusively formed amid the cesspits of frozen Cocytus, the seventh layer of Hell. Within the Pit they serve countless infernal lords as messengers and spies, with droves being unleashed upon myriad mortal worlds with a mandate to seek out souls ripe for corruption or those whose sins might lead to greater damnations. Many zebubs overstep the freedoms of such vague missions, seeking to manipulate weak-willed or easily intimidated mortals into all manner of trivial evils, dispensing shrill orders in their buzzing, childlike voices. Despite the fact that many zebub plots end in the zebubs' own revelation and destruction, few diabolical lords allow the slaying of their spies to go unpunished.

The zebub's ability to grant other creatures visions of what it has witnessed makes it an unusually useful creature to many conjurers. Relatively easy to conjure with a spell like _ [lesser planar ally](additionalMonsters/../spells/planarAlly.md#_planar-ally-lesser)_ or _ [lesser planar binding](additionalMonsters/../spells/planarBinding.md#_planar-binding-lesser)_, an accuser devil can be an invaluable spy. One simply orders the foul little devil to become invisible and then infiltrate an area where visual information is hidden, with orders to teleport back to its point of origin to grant visions of what it observed to its master. Those who make use of accuser devils in this manner should take care to watch their own actions or what they reveal, of course, for such a creature can just as easily be bribed or intimidated into revealing visions that some conjurers might not want being made public. It's common practice among conjurers to kill their accuser devils once they've completed their missions of infiltration and observation.

These lesser devils stand just over 2 feet tall and rarely weigh more than 25 pounds.

Special Abilities

**Possession (Su)** When a belier [devil](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_devil-subtype) uses its _ [magic jar](additionalMonsters/../spells/magicJar.md#_magic-jar)_ spell-like ability, it can identify and pinpoint life forces accurately, allowing it to select its victims with ease. It does not require a receptacle to use _ [magic jar](additionalMonsters/../spells/magicJar.md#_magic-jar)_. If it uses _ [magic jar](additionalMonsters/../spells/magicJar.md#_magic-jar)_ on a host while on the Material Plane, its own body becomes ethereal for the duration of the possession and the _ [magic jar](additionalMonsters/../spells/magicJar.md#_magic-jar)_ effect lasts until the effect is dispelled, the [devil](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_devil-subtype) ends the effect, it is forced out of its host body, or it or its host body is slain.

Masterful possessors and foul manipulators, belier devils are among the most feared masterminds of Hell. Known as bdellavritras to devilkind, these worm-like fiends avoid physical confrontation. Instead, they target influential individuals for possession, using them to manipulate events by proxy. If their schemes are uncovered, the devils retaliate with all the power at their host bodies' disposal.

A bdellavritra's voice can emanate from its worm-like maw, from any of its human-like mouths, or from all four at once, as it desires. Each mouth has its own distinct voice, often pleasing to the human ear. Bdellavritras typically reach lengths of 16 feet from worm-mouth to human heads, and weigh 3,000 pounds.

Special Abilities

**Agile Grappler (Ex)** A gylou does not gain the grappled condition if she grapples a foe.

**Tentacle Cage (Su)** If a gylou successfully grapples a creature, she transfers that creature into her lower body's nest of cage-like tentacles. This works like swallow whole. The gylou's tentacles are AC 17 and have 18 hp for the purpose of an entrapped creature cutting itself out. A gylou's tendrils heal quickly, allowing her to use this ability 1 round after a creature cuts itself free.

Known as handmaiden devils, Mothers of Pain, and Maids of Miscarriage, gylous attend to the whims and schemes of Hell's few female overlords. Like manipulative matrons amid decadent mortal courts, these deceivers hide their fathomless evil beneath illusions of beauty, graciousness, and tradition. Gylous particularly loathe children. It's said that the persistent cry of a babe can sometimes cause these fiends to abandon their illusions and viciously attack.

As greater devils, gylous can command many lesser devils, yet harbor an exclusive favoritism for erinyes. A gylou weighs 160 pounds and stands stiffly at 5-1/2 feet—though many wear their head-sprouting tentacles in tall, elaborate coiffures.

Immolation devils are tyrant warlords and terrifying field generals among Hell's legions. While many other greater devils manipulate and corrupt subtly and from afar, puragaus surround themselves with lesser diabolical minions, lead interplanar incursions, hold infernal redoubts upon mortal worlds, or strike against any who would defy the will of Hell.

Immolation devils stand just over 10 feet tall, with wingspans nearing 20 feet, and weigh 900 pounds.
