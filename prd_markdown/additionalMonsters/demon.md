**Treasure** standard

Special Abilities

**Enslave Soul (Su)** A kalavakus can attempt to enslave the soul of any mortal creature within 60 feet as a swift action. The kalavakus must have line of sight to the target. The target can resist this special attack with a DC 18 Will save, but is staggered for 1 round even if the save is successful. If the save is successful, the creature is immune to this ability for 24 hours. If the save is a failure, the target's soul is enslaved—this creature takes a –6 penalty on all attack rolls and saving throws against that kalavakus. If a creature with an enslaved soul is slain by that kalavakus, the soul immediately infuses the [demon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_demon-subtype)'s body, affecting it with a _ [heal](additionalMonsters/../spells/heal.md#_heal)_ spell (CL 12th). A kalavakus can have only one mortal soul enslaved at a time—if it enslaves a second soul, the first is released. This is a mind-affecting death effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Horns (Ex)** The kalavakus's numerous horns can easily catch weapons and yank them away from opponents. The [demon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_demon-subtype) gains a +4 racial bonus on all disarm attempts as a result.

Known to some as “horned demons,” the kalavakus demons are hulking, muscled beasts. They work as slavers on the Abyss, sometimes as harem keepers or captains of the guard for a more powerful demon, and at other times as mercenaries who sell their captured victims for profit to anyone with the funds to pay.

A kalavakus is 7 feet tall and weighs 450 pounds. They form from the souls of evil mortals who were slavers in their mortal lives.

Special Abilities

**Liquid Leap (Sp)** As long as an omox is in contact with liquid, it can use _ [dimension door](additionalMonsters/../spells/dimensionDoor.md#_dimension-door)_ as a swift action (CL 12th); its starting and ending points must be connected by a contiguous mass of liquid.

**Slime (Su)** An omox's nauseating body is composed of sticky, acidic slime. As an attack action, it can hurl a glob of slime (range increment 20 feet). Any creature that is struck by the glob must make a DC 23 Reflex save or become entangled for 1d6 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Smothering (Ex)** An omox can use its [grab](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_grab) ability against a creature of any size. When it grabs a foe, it attempts to flow over and into the victim's mouth and nose to smother it. Each round the omox maintains its grapple, its victim cannot breathe or speak. See page 445 of the _Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook_ for rules on how long a victim can hold its breath and the consequences of suffocation.

Amorphous beings of living slime, these repulsive demons lurk in fetid pools and lakes of filth, eager to drown unwary passersby. When summoned to the Material Plane, omoxes typically guard places of sacred filth or waters watched over by cults of Jubilex, the demon lord with which these foul demons are most commonly associated.

A typical omox stands 7 feet tall and weighs 1,200 pounds. They form from the souls of those who destroyed beautiful things in life, or who befouled and desecrated objects of purity.

**Paralyzing [Gaze](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_gaze) (Su)** Paralysis for 1 round, 30 feet, Fortitude DC 21 negates. [Evil](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_evil-subtype) creatures are immune to this effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Strength Drain (Su)** A shemhazian [demon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_demon-subtype) deals 2d4 points of Strength drain with each successful bite. A DC 27 Fortitude save reduces this amount to 1d4 points of Strength damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Although nearly all the horrors of the Abyss prey upon one another in an endless, eternal bloodbath, shemhazians are predators among predators. They are more intimidating and physically powerful than most demons, combining the features of numerous insectile and bestial hunters into one massive, deadly form. Although they don't require sustenance, shemhazians take perverse delight in mutilating and eating their victims.

A shemhazian stands 35 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds. They form from the sinful souls of torturers and those who enjoyed mutilating living victims to death.

Special Abilities

**Black Flame Knives (Su)** A vrolikai can manifest daggers made of crystallized black flames in each of its four hands as a free action. These weapons function as _+1 daggers _that bestow one permanent negative level on a successful hit. A DC 27 Fortitude negates the negative level, although on a critical hit, no save is allowed. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Death-Stealing Gaze (Su)** 1 permanent negative level, 30 ft., Fort DC 27 negates. Creatures slain by these negative levels become juju zombies under the vrolikai's control. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Madness (Su)** A creature stung by a vrolikai's tail must make a DC 27 Will save to resist taking 1d6 points of Charisma drain and becoming confused for 1d4 rounds. On a successful save, the victim is instead staggered for 1d4 rounds as strange visions assault its mind. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**[Multiweapon Mastery](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_multiweapon-mastery) (Ex)** A vrolikai never takes penalties on its attack roll when fighting with multiple weapons.

A vrolikai is 14 feet tall but weighs only 500 pounds. Unlike other demons, it does not form from a sinful soul—it instead manifests from a nabasu demon that returns to the Abyss after growing to maturity on the Material Plane. Not all nabasus survive this transformation, but those who do become powerful indeed—vrolikai usually rule large regions of unclaimed Abyssal land, and often serve as assassins or ambassadors to demon lords in need of an agent in a distant realm.
