The result of an unfortunate union between an ogre and a humanoid, the ogrekin (or half-ogre) is cursed with horrific malformations due to its tragic ancestry. Shunned by both parents, ogrekin tend to form unstable clans of their own, often resorting to inbreeding to sustain the collective. While good-natured ogrekin are not entirely unheard of, they are far and few between.

## Creating an Ogrekin

“Ogrekin” is an inherited template that can be added to any Medium humanoid (referred to hereafter as the base creature). An ogrekin retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**CR** : Same as base creature +1 (minimum 2).

**Alignment** : Usually evil.

**Type** : The creature's subtype changes to giant.

**Armor Class** : Natural armor improves by +3.

**Ability Scores** : Str +6, Con +4, Int –2, Cha –2.

**Special Qualities and Defenses** : An ogrekin gains low-light vision. In addition, ogrekin receive two random deformities—one beneficial and one disadvantageous.

**Beneficial Deformities** : The ogrekin gains one of these, chosen randomly.

3: _Light Sensitive_: The ogrekin gains light sensitivity.

4: _Obese_: The ogrekin takes a –2 penalty to Dexterity (minimum score of 1).

5: _Stunted Legs_: The ogrekin's base speed is reduced by 10 feet (minimum base speed of 5 feet).
