# Xacarba

This towering, three-tailed, six-eyed beast seems like three rune-backed serpents partially melded together into one body.

Special Abilities

**[Poison](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_poison-(ex-or-su)) (Su)** Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 25; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ one chosen by the xacarba from three options; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

_Fiendish Bile_: _effect_ 1d4 Str damage (good-aligned creatures also take 2d8 points of damage).

_Mysterious Blood_: _effect_ 1d4 Dex and 1d4 Wis damage plus confusion for 1 round.

_Vile Disjunction_: _effect_ targeted _ [greater dispel magic](additionalMonsters/../spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic-greater)_ (CL 18th) on the creature.

**Redirect Spell (Su)** Any creature that attempts to cast a spell within 30 feet of a xacarba must cast the spell defensively. If the caster fails the concentration check to do so (or if the caster opts to not cast defensively), the xacarba can choose the target of the spell as a immediate action. The new target must be a legal target—if there's no legal alternative target to choose from, this ability cannot be used.

Fiends hailing from the darkest reaches of the Abyss, xacarbas are manipulation and destruction intertwined. With their infamous ability to redirect spells, these serpentine goliaths wreak havoc on the mind as well as the body, turning allies against one another and reveling in the destruction doing so produces.
