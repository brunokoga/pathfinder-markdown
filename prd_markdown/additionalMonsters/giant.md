# Giant, Marsh

Cold, black eyes stare out from the fish-like face of this hideous green-skinned, web-fingered, and obese giant.

**Treasure** standard (gaff, other treasure)

Hideously ugly, marsh giants dwell in the most desolate of swamps—preferably those that share a sodden border with the sea. Marsh giants typically use a hooked club called a gaff (wielded in both hands) in combat—treat these weapons as flails, save that they do piercing damage.

Marsh giants are hateful thugs bound together by a common zealotry. Powerful opponents and beasts are the most prized of meals, though many marsh giants are also cannibals—they often attack fellow tribe members just to gorge on a particularly fearsome or delicious-looking relative.

Some marsh giants mingle with abominations from the deepest seas, creatures they believe are sent by their god. This has further contributed to their racial degradation, but the immediate offspring of these unholy unions are powerful. Deformed with tentacles, scales, and other aquatic traits, these marsh giants are known as “brineborn.” They are advanced marsh giants with the aquatic subtype, a swim speed of 40 feet, the amphibious special quality, and the following additional spell-like abilities:

**Treasure** standard (masterwork full plate armor, masterwork longsword, 3 masterwork spears, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Command Giant (Su)** A rune giant gains a +4 racial bonus on the save DC of charm or compulsion effects used against giants.

**Runes (Ex)** As a free action, whenever a rune giant uses its spark shower or spell-like abilities, it can cause the runes on its body to flash with light. All creatures within 10 feet of the giant must make a DC 24 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1 round. The saving throw is Charisma-based.

**Spark Shower (Su)** As a standard action, a rune giant can cause a shower of sparks to erupt out of one of the runes on its body. These sparks function as a [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) (30-ft. cone; 10d6 [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) and 10d6 electricity damage; Reflex DC 29 half; usable once every 1d4 rounds). The save DC is Constitution-based.

Magically crafted and crossbred from taiga and fire giant slaves by ancient wizards, rune giants are anathema to their own kind. Given power to command and magically control other giants, the rune giants themselves served their even more powerful masters, and in so doing granted ancient empires armies of giants to command. In the eons since these ancient empires collapsed, rune giants have persisted as a race of their own, little more than bogeymen, horrors whispered of late at night by superstitious giants.

Rune giants' charcoal flesh is decorated by dozens of runes—manifestations of their eldritch powers. Rune giants are 40 feet tall and weigh 25,000 pounds.

# Giant, Taiga

This muscular giant has dark gray skin and fiery red hair. Its lower jaw bears sharp fangs, and it wields a huge, primitive spear.

**Treasure** standard (hide armor, spear, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Spirit Summoning (Su)** Once per day, a taiga giant may perform a 10-minute ritual to tap into the power and insight of his ancestral spirits. These spirits provide a +4 deflection bonus to AC, [immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to enchantment and illusion spells, and one of the following spell effects: _ [bless](additionalMonsters/../spells/bless.md#_bless)_, _ [endure elements](additionalMonsters/../spells/endureElements.md#_endure-elements)_, _ [protection from evil](additionalMonsters/../spells/protectionFromEvil.md#_protection-from-evil)_, _ [protection from good](additionalMonsters/../spells/protectionFromGood.md#_protection-from-good)_, or _ [see invisibility](additionalMonsters/../spells/seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility)_. The effects of a spirit summoning persist for 24 hours.

Taiga giants wander endlessly to keep from depleting the food supply of any one area. Aurochs and mammoths are their preferred inland prey, while whales, seals, and walruses provide food in coastal regions. These animals form the cornerstone of tribal survival, not just for the food they provide but because nearly all of a tribe's possessions, from their portable shelters to their weapons, are crafted from the bone, hides, and sinews of felled beasts. Little is wasted.

Taiga giants are also deeply spiritual, worshiping their ancestors. Every tribe member learns to call forth ancestor spirits at a young age. Taiga giants are ashamed of being the ancestors of rune giants as, like most giants, they both hate and fear rune giants as slavers and monsters.

A typical taiga giant stands 20 feet in height and weighs 10,000 pounds. Skin tones vary from dark to pale gray, with hair color ranging from dark brown to red.

# Giant, Wood

Standing tall and graceful, this sharp-eared giant's skin is pale. Its large brow gives it a somewhat primitive visage.

Wood giants are the wardens of the deepest, wildest portions of the world's forests. Unlike many of their kin, wood giants are slow to anger, peaceful, and artistic, and display an infinite patience in their duty. A wood giant's role is to preserve and protect the wilderness—a role they believe that nature itself granted them, the proof of which manifests in their magical abilities tied to the natural world.

Wood giant culture is as complex as their forest homes. Much of a tribe's time is spent tending to a forest's health: planting new trees, clearing away dead brush, and hunting abominations that pervert the natural order. Individuals may even cultivate their forest homes into elaborate demesnes, mazes, or living temples. They are an isolated race, only rarely meeting to trade with other tribes or the occasional elven settlement. While primarily good-natured, wood giants are distrustful of outsiders and prone to great melancholies.

Small clans claim enormous tracts of wooded land, but rarely build permanent homes. Members may spread out over their entire region by day only to gather and bed down, exposed to the elements, after sundown. In harsh weather, tribes cluster close together in the densest thickets with their backs turned outward.

Wood giants stand 14 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds. They are vegetarians by choice, resorting to eating meat only when no other option is available.
