# Dragon, Primal

Though chromatic and metallic dragons are the most widely known, other categories of true dragon exist. Presented on the following pages are the five primal dragons—powerful creatures that hail from the elemental planes and the Plane of Shadows.

## Primal Dragon Types

[Brine](additionalMonsters/#primal-dragon,-brine), [Cloud](additionalMonsters/#primal-dragon,-cloud), [Crystal](additionalMonsters/#primal-dragon,-crystal), [Magma](additionalMonsters/#primal-dragon,-magma), [Umbral](additionalMonsters/#primal-dragon,-umbral)

## Age Categories

Many of a true dragon's abilities, attacks, and other statistics improve as a dragon grows older. These increases are divided into 12 age categories—as a dragon ages, its base statistics change as noted on the Dragon Age Categories table.

**Age Category** : This is the age category's name.

**Age in Years** : This is the dragon's actual age.

**CR** : This column modifies the dragon's base CR.

**Size** : This column shows the number of size categories to increase the dragon's base size by, depending on its age (from Tiny to Small, Small to Medium, and so on). A true dragon does not gain the standard increases to ability scores when it achieves a larger size—instead, true dragons gain ability score increases according to their age category, as indicated on the Dragon Ability Scores table.

**Hit Dice** : This shows how many additional Hit Dice a dragon gains over its base Hit Dice as it grows. Increases to Hit Dice grant extra hit points, feats, and skill ranks as well as increasing the dragon's base attack bonus and base save bonuses. Dragons have skill ranks equal to 6 + their Intelligence modifier per Hit Die. A dragon's increases to ability scores for gaining Hit Dice are included in the total ability score increases (see the Dragon Ability Scores table).

**Natural Armor** : This shows the amount the dragon's base natural armor bonus increases with each age category.

**Breath Weapon** : Each dragon has a breath weapon (see Combat) that deals a base amount of damage. This multiplier increases the number of dice of damage dealt by the dragon's breath weapon. For example, a mature adult dragon with a base breath weapon that deals 2d6 acid damage would deal 14d6 acid damage (due to the ×7 multiplier).

## Combat

The Dragon Attacks and Speeds table lists the attacks a dragon can employ and the damage it deals (a dash indicates a dragon of that size does not possess that natural attack). Dragons gain other abilities described here when they reach a specific age category.

**Fly Speed** : A dragon's fly speed increases as indicated, according to its size.

**Bite** : This is a primary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (even though it has more than one attack). A dragon's bite attack has reach as if the creature were one size category larger (+10 feet for Colossal dragons).

**Claws** : These primary attacks deal the indicated damage plus the dragon's Strength bonus.

**Wings** : The dragon can slam foes with its wings, even when flying. Wing attacks are secondary attacks that deal the indicated damage plus 1/2 the dragon's Strength bonus.

**Tail Slap** : The dragon can slap one foe each round with its tail. A tail slap is a secondary attack that deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (this is an exception to the normal secondary attack rules).

**Crush (Ex)** A flying or jumping Huge or larger dragon can land on foes as a standard action, using its whole body to crush them. Crush attacks are effective only against opponents three or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A crush attack affects as many creatures as fit in the dragon's space. Creatures in the affected area must succeed on a Reflex save (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon) or be pinned, automatically taking bludgeoning damage during the next round unless the dragon moves off them. If the dragon chooses to maintain the pin, it must succeed at a combat maneuver check as normal. Pinned foes take damage from the crush each round if they don't escape. A crush attack deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus.

**Tail Sweep (Ex)** This allows a Gargantuan or larger dragon to sweep with its tail as a standard action. The sweep affects a half-circle with a radius of 30 feet (or 40 feet for a Colossal dragon), extending from an intersection on the edge of the dragon's space in any direction. Creatures within the swept area are affected if they are four or more size categories smaller than the dragon. A tail sweep automatically deals the indicated damage plus 1-1/2 times the dragon's Strength bonus (round down). Affected creatures can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage (DC equal to that of the dragon's breath weapon).

**Breath Weapon (Su)** Using a breath weapon is a standard action. A dragon can use its breath weapon once every 1d4 rounds, even if it possesses more than one breath weapon. A breath weapon always starts at an intersection adjacent to the dragon and extends in a direction of the dragon's choice. Breath weapons come in two shapes, lines and cones, whose areas vary with the dragon's size. If a breath weapon deals damage, those caught in the area can attempt Reflex saves to take half damage. The save DC against a breath weapon is 10 + 1/2 dragon's HD + dragon's Con modifier. Saves against various breath weapons use the same DC; the type of saving throw is noted in the variety descriptions. A dragon can use its breath weapon when it is grappling or being grappled.

## Additional Dragon Rules

**Dragon Senses (Ex)** Dragons have darkvision 120 feet and blindsense 60 feet. They see four times as well as a human in dim light and twice as well in normal light.

**Frightful Presence (Ex)** A dragon's frightful presence has a range equal to 30 feet × the dragon's age category, but otherwise functions as detailed in the universal monster rules in the appendix.

**Spells** : A dragon knows and casts arcane spells as a sorcerer of the level indicated in its specific description. Its caster level depends on its age, as shown for each type.

**Spell-Like Abilities** : A dragon's caster level for its spell-like abilities is equal to its total Hit Dice.

**Damage Reduction** : Dragons gain damage reduction as they age, as indicated on each dragon's specific entry. Their natural weapons are treated as magic weapons for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction.

**Immunities (Ex)** Every dragon is immune to sleep effects and paralysis effects. In addition, a dragon is immune to one or more additional forms of attack or energy damage no matter what its age, as given in its specific description.

**Spell Resistance (Ex)** As dragons grow older, they become more resistant to spells and spell-like abilities, as indicated in the specific dragon descriptions. A dragon's SR is equal to 11 + its CR.

# Primal Dragon, Brine

A blue-green neck frill sweeps back from the head of this dragon, leading to a body of shiny scales and fin-like crests.

Special Abilities

**Capsize (Ex)** An old or older brine [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's [Profession](additionalMonsters/../skills/profession.md#_profession) (sailor) check, whichever is higher. For each size category larger the ship is than the brine [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s size, the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) takes a cumulative –10 penalty on the check.

**Desiccating Bite (Su)** An ancient brine [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s bite causes weakness, dealing 1d2 points of Strength drain in addition to its normal damage. A great wyrm's bite deals 1d4 points of Strength drain. A Fortitude save (DC equals the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) save DC) negates the Strength drain.

**Painful Strikes (Su)** A great wyrm brine [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s natural attacks are so laden with salt and acidic crystals that every time it strikes a creature with one of these attacks, the target must make a Fortitude save (DC equals the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) save DC) or be stunned for a round from the pain.

**Spell-like Abilities (Sp)** A brine [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) at the listed age. Very young—_ [speak with animals](additionalMonsters/../spells/speakWithAnimals.md#_speak-with-animals)_ (fish only); Young—_ [obscuring mist](additionalMonsters/../spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)_; Juvenile—_ [water breathing](additionalMonsters/../spells/waterBreathing.md#_water-breathing)_; Adult—_ [control water](additionalMonsters/../spells/controlWater.md#_control-water)_; Ancient—_ [horrid wilting](additionalMonsters/../spells/horridWilting.md#_horrid-wilting)_ (3/day); Great wyrm—_ [tsunami](additionalMonsters/../advanced/spells/tsunami.md#_tsunami)_ (3/day).

Although not inherently evil, brine dragons have little patience for kindness and philanthropy. As they age, they grow more and more opinionated and obsessed with power—by adult age, a brine dragon counts itself a failure if it doesn't rule over a collection of “lesser beings” such as humans, merfolk, locathah, or even sahuagin.

# Primal Dragon, Cloud

The blue-white scales of this four-horned dragon exude wisps of fog. The dragon's snout is short but filled with sharp teeth.

Special Abilities

**Cloud Form (Su)** An adult or older cloud [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can change itself into a cloudy vapor as a swift action for a number of rounds per day equal to its Hit Dice. This ability functions as _ [gaseous form](additionalMonsters/../spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)_ but the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s fly speed is unchanged.

**Cloud Breath (Su)** A great wyrm cloud [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) creates a cloud that persists in its cone shape for 1d4 rounds. Treat this cloud as a _ [fog cloud](additionalMonsters/../spells/fogCloud.md)_ that deals electricity damage equal to half the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) damage to any creature that ends its turn still within the cloud (Reflex save halves the damage—DC equals the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) save DC).

**Mist Vision (Su)** A cloud [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can see through fog, clouds, and similar obscuring effects with perfect clarity.

**Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)** A cloud [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very young—_ [obscuring mist](additionalMonsters/../spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)_; Young—_ [fog cloud](additionalMonsters/../spells/fogCloud.md)_; Adult—_ [solid fog](additionalMonsters/../spells/solidFog.md#_solid-fog)_; Old—_ [cloudkill](additionalMonsters/../spells/cloudkill.md#_cloudkill)_ (3/day); Ancient—_ [wind walk](additionalMonsters/../spells/windWalk.md#_wind-walk)_; Great wyrm—_ [storm of vengeance](additionalMonsters/../spells/stormOfVengeance.md#_storm-of-vengeance) _(1/day).

**Thundering Bite (Su)** An ancient or older cloud [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s bite makes a thundering crash whenever it attacks, dealing an additional 2d6 points of sonic damage. A great wyrm's thundering bite deals an additional 4d6 sonic damage.

Cloud dragons stay out of the complicated political schemes and obsessions of other dragons (especially the chromatic dragons), preferring to live their lives freely and as the whim to travel strikes them. Exploration and viewing new lands from far above are the cloud dragon's greatest joy, rivaled only by speaking with new creatures and gaining exotic treasures from them. They keep lairs on high mountain peaks, but are often away on journeys of discovery, returning home only when they've claimed a new treasure that needs to be placed in safekeeping back home.

Crystal dragons are generally good-natured, though their incredible vanity sometimes causes them to seem aloof and cocky. Any perceived insult against its appearance is all but assured to send a crystal dragon into a rage—which is a problem, as most crystal dragons are prone to seeing insults even where none are intended. Crystal dragons prefer underground lairs, and often go for decades or even centuries without emerging from their extensive cavern lairs onto the surface world above.

Crystal dragons tend to be exacting and even obsessive-compulsive, their personalities mirroring the precise and ordered nature of the facets of their scales. A crystal dragon's lair is a well-ordered place—these dragons find the very idea of the classic sprawl of a dragon's hoard to be shameful.

# Primal Dragon, Magma

Between this dragon's jet-black scales run glowing rivulets of lava, and veins aglow with heat shine in the membranes of its wings.

Special Abilities

**Magma Tomb (Su)** Once per day, a great wyrm magma [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can spit lava onto a target within 120 feet, dealing damage normally for its [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon). This magma cools instantly—it does not continue doing damage at this point but does [entrap](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_entrap-(ex-or-su)) the victim (see universal monster rules in appendix; DC equals the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) save DC, 3d6 minutes, hardness 8, hp 45).

**Magma Breath (Su)** Three times per day, an ancient or older magma [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can breathe a cone of lava instead of [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype). The damage is unchanged, but the magma clings to those it damages, dealing half damage each round thereafter for 1d3 rounds. After this magma cools, it crumbles to dust.

**Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)** A magma [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Very young—_ [burning hands](additionalMonsters/../spells/burningHands.md#_burning-hands)_; Juvenile—_ [scorching ray](additionalMonsters/../spells/scorchingRay.md#_scorching-ray)_; Adult—_ [wall of fire](additionalMonsters/../spells/wallOfFire.md#_wall-of-fire)_; Old—_ [fire shield](additionalMonsters/../spells/fireShield.md#_fire-shield) _(warm shield, constant); Ancient—_ [delayed blast fireball](additionalMonsters/../spells/delayedBlastFireball.md#_delayed-blast-fireball)_ (3/day); Great wyrm—_ [wall of lava](additionalMonsters/../advanced/spells/wallOfLava.md#_wall-of-lava)_.

**Superheated (Su)** At young age and older, a magma [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s bite attack deals additional [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) damage equal to its age category.

Temperamental and prone to violent outbursts, magma dragons are regarded by most other dragons as dangerously insane—an assumption that, more often than not, proves correct. One can rarely predict a magma dragon's state of mind until it either attacks or attempts to engage in conversation. For their part, magma dragons can justify all of their actions—they just rarely feel the need to do so.

# Primal Dragon, Umbral

This sleek, dark dragon moves with a disturbing, serpentine grace, its eyes glowing as if lit from within by crimson embers.

Special Abilities

**[Breath Weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) (Su)** Although it deals negative energy damage, an umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s [breath weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_breath-weapon) does not heal [undead](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_undead) creatures.

**Create Shadows (Su)** Any creature slain by an ancient or older umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) rises as a shadow (if 8 HD or less) or greater shadow (if above 8 HD) under the umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s control 1d4 rounds later.

**Energy Drain (Su)** A great wyrm umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) deals 1 negative level with each successful bite or claw attack (1 level, DC 32).

**Ghost Bane (Su)** A young or older umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon)'s physical attacks deal damage to [incorporeal](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_incorporeal-subtype) creatures normally.

**Umbral Scion (Ex)** Umbral dragons have [negative energy affinity](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_negative-energy-affinity) and are immune to energy drain and death effects.

**Shadow Breath (Su)** Three times per day, an adult or older umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) can breathe a cone of shadows. Creatures who fail a Fortitude save are blinded for 1d4 rounds and take 1 point of Str drain per age category possessed by the [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon). A successful save negates the blindness and reduces Str drain to 1d4 points.

**Spell-Like Abilities (Sp)** An umbral [dragon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_dragon) gains the following spell-like abilities, usable at will (unless indicated otherwise) on reaching the listed age category. Young—_ [darkness](additionalMonsters/../spells/darkness.md#_darkness)_; Juvenile—_ [vampiric touch](additionalMonsters/../spells/vampiricTouch.md#_vampiric-touch)_; Adult—_ [shadow walk](additionalMonsters/../spells/shadowWalk.md#_shadow-walk)_; Old—_ [project image](additionalMonsters/../spells/projectImage.md#_project-image)_; Ancient—_ [finger of death](additionalMonsters/../spells/fingerOfDeath.md#_finger-of-death)_ (3/day), Great wyrm—_ [shades](additionalMonsters/../spells/shades.md#_shades)_. An umbral dragon can cast cleric spells as arcane spells.
