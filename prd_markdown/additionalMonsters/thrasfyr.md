Special Abilities

**Entangling Chains (Su)** A thrasfyr can control the six chains that hang from its body as if they were its own limbs. As a standard action, it can cause these chains to snake outward to a radius of 30 feet. All creatures in this area take 10d6 points of slashing damage and become entangled—a DC 20 Reflex save halves the damage and negates the entangled condition. An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Reflex save or a DC 30 [Escape Artist](additionalMonsters/../skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) check made as a full-round action. The chains can also be sundered (hardness 10, hp 20, Break DC 28). The thrasfyr creates these chains from its own body—destroyed chains regrow in 24 hours. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**Master's Bond (Su)** A thrasfyr can form a bond with a willing creature by touching that creature. This allows the thrasfyr to communicate telepathically with the bonded creature with no range restriction (provided the thrasfyr and its master are on the same plane). Both thrasfyr and master can sense the other's condition as if both were under the effect of a _ [status](additionalMonsters/../spells/status.md#_status)_ spell. A thrasfyr can maintain a bond with only one master at a time.

**Planar Acclimation (Ex)** A thrasfyr is always considered to be on its home plane, regardless of what plane it finds itself upon. It never gains the [extraplanar](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_extraplanar-subtype) subtype.

The legendary thrasfyr is one of the Tane—a group of powerful monsters created by godlike beings from the primal world of the fey. A thrasfyr without a master prefers to dwell in rugged hilly regions, where it spends most of its time slumbering and dreaming—it is said that all thrasfyrs dream of themselves as graceful and beautiful fey, for legends say that the first thrasfyrs were created from such creatures as a form of punishment.
