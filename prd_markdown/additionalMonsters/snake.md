Infamous among travelers for its deadly poisonous bite, the emperor cobra is a foul-tempered snake typically encountered in bogs. The snake's scales are generally a dark green, with a pale green or even ivory underbelly. Its eyes are bright red and lack the distinctive serpentine slit most snake eyes possess. Emperor cobras are often trained to serve as guardians in temples. They are 16 feet long and weigh 200 pounds.

# Snake, Giant Anaconda

An enormous coil of muscle and scales, this giant snake flicks its arm-length tongue in the air as it scans the area for prey.

Of the multitude of slithering predators that infest jungles, forests, and swamps, few inspire such terror as the giant anaconda. Incredibly strong, fearless hunters, these creatures are capable of taking down and eating elephants, dinosaurs, and giants. Their olive green and black mottled scales afford them exceptional camouflage in the murky waters they call home. A giant anaconda can grow to a length of 60 feet.
