Special Abilities

**Animated Hair (Su)** A korred's hair is constantly writhing and twitching. As a free action, a korred can cause its long hair to reach out and interfere with adjacent creatures—tugging at clothes and weapons, tangling feet and arms, tickling, and generally making a nuisance of itself. The korred can select which adjacent targets are affected by its animated hair. These targets must make a successful DC 16 Reflex save each round to avoid becoming entangled for 1 round. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**Stone Stride (Su)** This ability works like _ [tree stride](additionalMonsters/../spells/treeStride.md#_tree-stride)_, except it requires loose boulders at least as large as the korred, and only has a range of 30 feet. The korred can use this ability once per round as a standard action.

**Stunning Laugh (Su)** Three times per day as a standard action, a korred can unleash a strange laugh that stuns all creatures within a 30-foot burst for 1d2 rounds (Fortitude DC 14 negates). This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect. [Fey](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fey) are immune to this ability. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Korreds are an ancient fey race who like forested areas with nice, rocky ground. They resemble small, wild-haired humanoids with wild, knotted hair. Korreds especially like to dance in ancient stone circles within forest glades, often led by satyrs with panpipes. They are a shy race and do not take kindly to outsiders discovering them, even by accident. They almost always attack non-korreds who stumble into their territory, seeking to kill them or at least drive them off.

Korred clothing normally consists of a simple leather apron, jerkin, or kilt, leaving their legs uncovered and their feet bare. Their clothes usually have a large pocket or pouch to hold their belongings. A korred's hair and beard grow quickly, sometimes an inch a day, and the korred trims its hair when the locks become too unruly, saving the trimmings in its pocket so it can weave them into ropes for its _ [animate rope](additionalMonsters/../spells/animateRope.md#_animate-rope)_ spell-like ability.
