The squat, burrowing badger is plentiful in most temperate forests. Most species are carnivorous, though some eat a variety of meat, insects, and vegetables. The badger possesses a fierceness and natural tenacity, while its stubby legs and wide, seemingly portly stature belie the creature's actual strength and speed.

A typical badger has dark brownish-gray fur highlighted with white markings, such as bands or striped masks about the eyes. These markings are distinct and vary by species. While generally friendly, if threatened or otherwise provoked, badgers can become fierce combatants. Once engaged with an opponent, they typically fight until slain. In combat, they fight with their sharp, needle-like teeth and long, curved claws, which they otherwise use for digging.

# Badger, Dire

A tremendous badger snarls and scrapes its wicked, shovel-like claws. Stocky muscles ripple beneath its streaked and shaggy fur.

A relentless predator, the violent and territorial dire badger hunts frequently, killing and devouring a variety of easy prey such as rabbits, deer, and occasionally livestock. These creatures are unafraid of attacking creatures larger than they are, drawing upon an almost legendary tenacity that has won them honor and respect among many races, particularly forest-dwelling gnomes.

Dire badgers reside in deep burrows and warrens dug with their monstrous claws—but unlike typical badgers, a dire badger's claws are capable of tunneling through solid rock. Dire badgers possess little patience for disturbances or interruptions. Utterly fearless creatures, when confronted they attack brutally, and if injured, they violently erupt into a killing frenzy.

Dire badgers stand 4 feet tall at the shoulder, and weigh 500 pounds.
