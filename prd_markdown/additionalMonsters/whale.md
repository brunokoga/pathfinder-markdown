Special Abilities

**Smashing Breach (Ex)** As a full-round action, a great white whale can make a special charge attack against creatures on the surface of the water. At the end of its charge, the whale breaches, then slams down onto the target with incredible force. Any Huge or smaller creatures in the whale's space must make a DC 27 Reflex save or take 4d8+30 points of bludgeoning damage and be forced into the nearest square that is adjacent to the whale. This breach automatically attempts to capsize any boats caught wholly or partially in this area. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Legendary in size and temper, great white whales are far more aggressive than their smaller kin.

# Whale 

This immense whale moves slowly through the water with a grace that seems incongruous, given its immense size.

Special Abilities

**Capsize (Ex)** A whale can attempt to capsize a boat or ship by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25, or the result of the captain's [Profession](/pathfinderRPG/prd/additionalMonsters/../skills/profession.html#_profession) (sail0r) check, whichever is higher. For each size category the ship is larger than the whale's size, the whale takes a cumulative –10 penalty on this CMB check.

Whales are frequently hunted for their meat and the valuable oil in their blubber. Baleen whales have no teeth and attack with a tail slap; toothed whales like sperm whales instead attack with a bite. Whale companions are smaller species—rules for such companions are the same as those for orcas (see page 88 of the _Pathfinder RPG Bestiary_.)
