# Hippopotamus

This lumbering bull hippopotamus lunges out of the water and yawns wide, displaying an impressive set of tusk-like teeth.

Special Abilities

**Capsize (Ex)** A hippopotamus can overturn a boat of its size or smaller by ramming it as a charge attack and making a CMB check. The DC of this check is 25 or the result of the boat captain's [Profession](additionalMonsters/../skills/profession.md#_profession) (sailor) check, whichever is higher.

**Sweat (Ex)** A hippo's reddish sweat protects it from nonlethal damage from hot environments, and grants it a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against nonmagical [disease](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_disease-(ex-or-su)).

The ill-tempered “river horse” has a well-earned reputation for hostility, despite the fact that it is a herbivore.

The behemoth hippopotamus is a true monster. Standing taller than an elephant, this animal has few enemies in the natural world—even dinosaurs and dire crocodiles avoid fights with them. Making them even more dangerous is the fact that they are practically carnivores—while not above eating plant matter, they devour carrion or foolish creatures that come too close.
