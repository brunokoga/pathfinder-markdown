# Dhampir 

This unnaturally graceful man moves without a sound, his gaze just as piercing as the needle-sharp blade he effortlessly wields.

Special Abilities

**Resist Level Drain (Ex)** A dhampir takes no penalties from energy draining effects, though he can still be killed if he accrues more negative levels then he has Hit Dice. After 24 hours, any negative levels a dhampir takes are removed without the need for an additional saving throw.

Cursed from birth, dhampirs result from the rare and unnatural union of vampires and humans. Although not driven to consume blood for survival as their undead progenitors are, dhampirs nonetheless know a lifelong desire for blood that nothing else can truly sate. Those who survive their early years face a life of fear and mistrust, their unnatural beauty and incredible reflexes marking them as scions of the night just as surely as their sensitivity to light. Although polluted by undeath, dhampirs do grow old and die, aging at a rate similar to elves.

## Dhampir Characters

**Senses** : Low-light vision and darkvision 60 feet.

**Manipulative** : +2 racial bonus on [Bluff](additionalMonsters/../skills/bluff.md#_bluff) and [Perception](additionalMonsters/../skills/perception.md#_perception).

**Undead Resistance** : Dhampirs gain a +2 racial bonus on saving throws against disease and mind-affecting effects.

**Light Sensitivity, Negative Energy Affinity** : See universal monster rules.

**Spell-Like Ability** : A dhampir can use_ [detect undead](additionalMonsters/../spells/detectUndead.md#_detect-undead)_ three times per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability equals the dhampir's class level.

**Resist Level Drain** : See above.

**Languages** : Dhampirs begin play speaking Common. Those with high Intelligence can choose any language as a bonus language (except druidic and other secret languages).
