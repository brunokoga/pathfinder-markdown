Special Abilities

**Aura of [Cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) (Su)** Winterwights are surrounded by a 10-foot radius of deathly chill. Any creatures within this area during the winterwight's turn takes 2d10 points of [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) damage. All creatures of the [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) subtype within this area (including the winterwight) are treated as having fast healing 10.

**Blightfire (Su)** Whenever a winterwight damages a creature with a bite or claw, the wound erupts with tongues of black [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype). For the next 5 rounds, the victim must make a DC 29 Fortitude saving throw at the start of its turn or take 1d6 points of Constitution drain. The winterwight gains 10 temporary hit points each time the creature fails a saving throw against blightfire. A creature cannot be affected by more than one instance of blightfire at a time. The save DC is Charisma-based.

The winterwight is an undead horror born from the coldest depths of the negative energy plane. Infused with the dark, cold magic that permeates this realm of death, the winterwight takes the form of a skeleton coated in armor of jagged ice.

Though it resembles an ordinary skeleton from a distance, the winterwight's frame is much sturdier than the average humanoid's, its frozen armor intertwining with its bone structure to form an incredibly hardy chassis. Sometimes called hatewraiths because of their insatiable lust for suffering, these frozen horrors are often found in areas that suffer from magical cold or frozen climates.

Winterwights are 7 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.
