# Shining Child 

Surrounded by a nimbus of near-blinding light, this strange creature looks something like an emaciated child with clawed hands.

Special Abilities

**Blinding Light (Ex)** A shining child can radiate a 60-foot-radius aura of blinding light as a free action. Creatures within the affected area must succeed on a DC 25 Fortitude save or be permanently blinded. A creature that successfully saves cannot be affected again by the same shining child's aura for 24 hours. The save is Constitution-based.

**Burning Touch (Su)** A shining child corrupts the positive energy within a living creature into an unnatural burning light. For the next 5 rounds after a successful touch attack by a shining child, the target takes 2d6 points of [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) damage. The burning light can be “extinguished” by casting _ [darkness](additionalMonsters/../spells/darkness.md#_darkness)_ or _ [deeper darkness](additionalMonsters/../spells/deeperDarkness.md#_deeper-darkness)_ on the target, or by entering an area of natural darkness (not counting the light from the burning target).

**Radiant Armor (Su)** The light that surrounds a shining child grants a deflection bonus to its AC equal to its Charisma bonus. The bonus is negated as long as the shining child is in the area of effect of a spell with the darkness descriptor that is at least 3rd level.

**Searing Ray (Su)** A shining child's primary attack is a ray of searing light. This attack has a range of 120 feet. The ray deals double damage to [undead](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_undead) creatures.

Creatures of burning light and strange geometry, shining children are a terror to behold. Beyond the flares of energy that constantly burst from their forms (particularly in beam-like gouts from their eyes and mouths), the creatures are vaguely humanoid, with strange hands that each bear four fingers. Occasionally summoned by powerful wizards in search of rare arcane knowledge, the shining children (who disdain individual names) communicate via telepathy, a psychic roar like metal tearing that sometimes resolves into strained and raspy words.

Though they harbor many secrets, their greatest secret may be their own origin. Numerous theories abound—that the shining children are beings from another dimension, avatars of a dying star grown sentient, or creatures of light battling living darkness at the edge of reality. A shining child stands just over 4-1/2 feet tall and weighs 85 pounds.
