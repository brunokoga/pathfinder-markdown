Special Abilities

**[Natural Invisibility](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_natural-invisibility-(ex-or-su)) (Su)** A quickling is invisible when motionless. It loses this invisibility and remains visible for 1 round in any round in which it takes an action other than a free action.

**Supernatural Speed (Su)** A quickling moves with incredible speed. Save for when it remains motionless (at which point it is invisible), the quickling's shape blurs and shimmers with this speed, granting it concealment (20% miss chance). In addition, this ability grants the quickling evasion and uncanny dodge (as the rogue abilities of the same names).

**Slow Susceptibility (Ex)** A quickling that succumbs to a _ [slow](additionalMonsters/../spells/slow.md#_slow)_ effect loses its supernatural speed ability and is sickened as long as the effect persists. This sickened condition persists for 1 round after the _ [slow](additionalMonsters/../spells/slow.md#_slow)_ effect ends.

Few creatures can match the speed of a quickling. These malicious fey creatures delight in striking with blinding speed and accuracy, often killing their victims without ever fully revealing themselves; the victim simply spurts blood and falls over dead, with no witnesses to the quickling's deed. Though related to brownies and grigs, quicklings share none of their kin's generosity or merriment, choosing instead to live a life of cruelty and viciousness. Quicklings pride themselves on insults and brutality, and frequently stalk and harass their quarry until the victim gives up the chase. While quicklings are naturally invisible when motionless, they rarely contain themselves, and bob and twitch while standing and talking to other creatures. Quicklings hate every other race of creature, particularly elves, gnomes, and other kinds of fey. They barely tolerate their own kind, and rarely work together for longer than a few weeks.

Quicklings stand just over 2-1/2 feet tall and weigh 15 pounds.
