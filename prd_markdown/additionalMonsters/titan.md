A race that was old when the world was young, titans are very near to the divine. This nearness inspired bitterness in the hearts of the mightiest titans, and when they grew jealous of the adulation the gods received from mortals, they began a crusade to destroy mortal life. As this war began, the Elysian titans turned against their kin and, by sacrificing some of their power to the gods, convinced the deities to banish their arrogant kin to the Abyss.

Lone Elysian titans often wander the planes, seeking enlightenment or exploring ancient places of power. Others still have the crusading impulse of the ancient war and can be found manipulating events from behind the scenes, training aspiring heroes, counseling kings, marshaling armies to overthrow tyranny, and inspiring mortals to become legends. A titan does not age—unless slain by violence, a titan is immortal.

One in every dozen Elysian titans is a prophet—a titan who manifests the goodwill of the gods and possesses the spellcasting power of a 20th-level cleric. These titans do not gain access to domains or any other cleric class abilities. They are CR 22 creatures.

Elysian titans are 70 feet tall and weigh 20 tons.

Special Abilities

**Godslayer (Su)** When a thanatotic titan damages a creature capable of casting divine spells, that creature must make a DC 28 Will save or be unable to cast any divine spells for 1d4 rounds and be shaken. If the save is successful, the creature struck is merely shaken for 1 round. A thanatotic titan's attacks are treated as epic and [evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_evil-subtype) for the purposes of overcoming [damage reduction](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_damage-reduction-(ex-or-su)). The save DC is Charisma-based.

Some believe that the titans were the first children of the gods—if this myth is true, then the fact that they waged war upon the gods becomes even more tragic. After they were betrayed to the gods by their own kin, the Thanatotic titans were banished into the Abyss. Today, they seethe with jealousy that their Elysian kin are allowed to wander the planes at will, while they can leave their Abyssal realm only by stealth. Now, these powerful outsiders spend much of their time brooding, fighting among themselves, and waging war for control of Abyssal realms against the legions of various demon lords.

Thanatotic titans see themselves as the true icons worthy of worship. Some work to found personal cults among mortals, while others simply wage unending crusades against the minions of the gods.
