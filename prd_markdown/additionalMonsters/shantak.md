Special Abilities

**Share Defenses (Su)** As a free action, a shantak can extend its [no breath](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_no-breath) ability and [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) [immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to a single creature touching it. It can withdraw this protection as a free action.

**Slippery (Ex)** A shantak's scales seep slippery slime. This grants the creature a +8 bonus on all [Escape Artist](additionalMonsters/../skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) checks and to its CMD against grapples, and imparts a –5 penalty on all [Ride](additionalMonsters/../skills/ride.md#_ride) checks made by creatures attempting to ride a shantak.

**Starflight (Su)** A shantak can survive in the void of outer space. It flies through space at an incredible speed. Although exact travel times vary, a trip within a single solar system should take 3d20 hours, while a trip beyond should take 3d20 days (or more, at the GM's discretion)—provided the shantak knows the way to its destination.

Shantaks speak in a shrill voice that sounds like glass grinding against stone. They are intelligent creatures and cannot be trained as mounts—a would-be shantak rider must use diplomacy or magic to secure a shantak's cooperation as a mount, and even then, shantaks have a tendency to deliberately strand riders in dangerous areas.

Many shantaks have a strange and irrational fear of certain creatures, such as the faceless nightgaunts said to dwell in certain remote mountains, or specific types of harpies or gargoyles in more civilized regions. A shantak avoids confrontations with these types of creatures if possible.

A shantak's ability to travel the gulfs of space ensures that these scaly, bird-like creatures can be found on numerous worlds. Yet despite this unique ability, shantaks are generally quite reluctant to seek out new worlds unless faced with no other option, for a shantak knows well that an attempt to fly to an unknown world could easily result in being lost forever in the gulfs of space.
