Much like their smaller kin, giant cockroaches are extremely adaptive and exist in any place they can find a ready source of food. Giant cockroaches are not normally very violent, but readily attack if threatened or if food becomes scarce.

A number of species of giant cockroach exist, as summarized on the table above. Most of these variants have additional abilities, such as poison stings.

# Cockroach Swarm

Like a pestilent black tide, a ravenous horde of thousands of tiny, clacking cockroaches washes over everything in its path.

Swarms of flesh-eating cockroaches are extremely virulent pests. Normally carnivorous scavengers, these vermin quickly transform into aggressive hunters when amassed in great numbers, actively seeking out territory and food and gravitating to locations that readily provide both, such as dumps, graveyards, sewers, swamps, and other foul areas filled with rotting waste. Although a flesh-eating cockroach swarm prefers to feed on rot and carrion, these ravenous creatures do not balk at attacking living creatures as large as an elephant if given a chance.
