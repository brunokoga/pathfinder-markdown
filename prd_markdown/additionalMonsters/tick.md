**[Grab](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_grab) (Ex)** A giant tick can [grab](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_grab) targets of any size, and has a +8 racial bonus on grapple checks rather than the normal +4 bonus most creatures with [grab](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_grab) possess.

**[Disease](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_disease-(ex-or-su)) (Ex)** _Red ache_: Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 13; _onset_ 1d3 days; _frequency_ 1/day; _effect_ 1d6 Str damage; cure 2 consecutive saves. The DC is Constitution-based.

In areas where large creatures like megafauna or dinosaurs dwell, the giant tick behaves much like its smaller kin—it lies in wait in the undergrowth, and when a suitable host passes by, it drops onto the body to feed. In other areas, these vermin are much more aggressive, and actively hunt smaller prey like dogs, livestock, or even humanoids. A giant tick drains blood quickly, but once it has caused 6 points of Constitution damage, it drops off, sated, to crawl away to digest. A giant tick is 3 feet long and weighs 50 pounds.

# Tick Swarm

The rasping legs of this hideous, shining carpet of fist-sized ticks rattle ominously as the swarm skitters forward.

Special Abilities

**Cling (Ex)** If a creature leaves a tick [swarm](monsters/creatureTypes#_swarm-subtype)'s square, the [swarm](monsters/creatureTypes#_swarm-subtype) takes 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several ticks cling to the victim. A creature with ticks clinging to it takes [swarm](monsters/creatureTypes#_swarm-subtype) damage at the end of its turn each round. As a full round action, the creature can remove the ticks with a DC 20 Reflex save. At least 10 points of damage from any area effect destroys all clinging ticks. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**[Disease](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_disease-(ex-or-su)) (Ex)** _Bubonic Plague_: Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 21; _onset_ 1 day; _frequency_ 1/day; _effect_ 1d4 Con damage, 1 Cha damage, fatigue; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The DC is Con-based.

Tick swarms are merciless blights, able to quickly reduce the larger animal life of a region they infest to blood-drained, diseased husks.
