# Feats

Some abilities are not tied to your race, class, or skill—things like particularly quick reflexes that allow you to react to danger more swiftly, the ability to craft magic items, the training to deliver powerful strikes with melee weapons, or the knack for deflecting arrows fired at you. These abilities are represented as feats. While some feats are more useful to certain types of characters than others, and many of them have special prerequisites that must be met before they are selected, as a general rule feats represent abilities outside of the normal scope of your character's race and class. Many of them alter or enhance class abilities or soften class restrictions, while others might apply bonuses to your statistics or grant you the ability to take actions otherwise prohibited to you. By selecting feats, you can customize and adapt your character to be uniquely yours.

# Prerequisites

Some feats have prerequisites. Your character must have the indicated ability score, class feature, feat, skill, base attack bonus, or other quality designated in order to select or use that feat. A character can gain a feat at the same level at which he gains the prerequisite.

A character can't use a feat if he loses a prerequisite, but he does not lose the feat itself. If, at a later time, he regains the lost prerequisite, he immediately regains full use of the feat that prerequisite enables.

# Types of Feats

Some feats are general, meaning that no special rules govern them as a group. Others are item creation feats, which allow characters to create magic items of all sorts. A metamagic feat lets a spellcaster prepare and cast a spell with greater effect, albeit as if the spell were of a higher spell level than it actually is.

## Combat Feats

Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming that they meet the prerequisites.

## Critical Feats

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim of the critical hit. Characters without the Critical Mastery feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after the critical hit has been confirmed.

## Item Creation Feats

An item creation feat lets a character create a magic item of a certain type. Regardless of the type of item each involves, the various item creation feats all have certain features in common.

**Raw Materials Cost** : The cost of creating a magic item equals half the base price of the item.

Using an item creation feat also requires access to a laboratory or magical workshop, special tools, and so on. A character generally has access to what he needs unless unusual circumstances apply.

**Time** : The time to create a magic item depends on the feat and the cost of the item.

**Item Cost** : Brew Potion, Craft Staff, Craft Wand, and Scribe Scroll create items that directly reproduce spell effects, and the power of these items depends on their caster level—that is, a spell from such an item has the power it would have if cast by a spellcaster of that level. The price of these items (and thus the cost of the raw materials) also depends on the caster level. The caster level must be low enough that the spellcaster creating the item can cast the spell at that level. To find the final price in each case, multiply the caster level by the spell level, then multiply the result by a constant, as shown below:

**_Scrolls:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 25 gp.**  
**_Potions:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 50 gp.**  
**_Wands:_ Base price = spell level × caster level × 750 gp.**  
**_Staves:_ The price for staves is calculated using more complex formulas (see [Magic Items](magicItems.html)).**

A 0-level spell is considered to have a spell level of 1/2 for the purpose of this calculation.

**Extra Costs** : Any potion, scroll, or wand that stores a spell with a costly material component also carries a commensurate cost. For potions and scrolls, the creator must expend the material component cost when creating the item. For a wand, the creator must expend 50 units of the material component. Some magic items similarly incur extra costs in material components, as noted in their descriptions.

**Skill Check** : Successfully creating a magic item requires a Spellcraft check with a DC equal to 5 + the item's caster level. Alternatively, you can use an associated Craft or Profession skill to attempt this check instead, depending upon the item being crafted. See [Magic Item Creation](magicItems/magicItemCreation.html) for more details on which Craft and Profession checks may be substituted in this manner. The DC of this check can increase if the crafter is rushed or does not meet all of the prerequisites. A failed check ruins the materials used, while a check that fails by 5 or more results in a cursed item. See [Magic Items](magicItems.html) for more details.

## Metamagic Feats

As a spellcaster's knowledge of magic grows, he can learn to cast spells in ways slightly different from the norm. Preparing and casting a spell in such a way is harder than normal but, thanks to metamagic feats, is at least possible. Spells modified by a metamagic feat use a spell slot higher than normal. This does not change the level of the spell, so the DC for saving throws against it does not go up. Metamagic feats do not affect spell-like abilities.

**Wizards and Divine Spellcasters** : Wizards and divine spellcasters must prepare their spells in advance. During preparation, the character chooses which spells to prepare with metamagic feats (and thus which ones take up higher-level spell slots than normal).

**Sorcerers and Bards** : Sorcerers and bards choose spells as they cast them. They can choose when they cast their spells whether to apply their metamagic feats to improve them. As with other spellcasters, the improved spell uses up a higher-level spell slot. Because the sorcerer or bard has not prepared the spell in a metamagic form in advance, he must apply the metamagic feat on the spot. Therefore, such a character must also take more time to cast a metamagic spell (one enhanced by a metamagic feat) than he does to cast a regular spell. If the spell's normal casting time is a standard action, casting a metamagic version is a full-round action for a sorcerer or bard. (This isn't the same as a 1-round casting time.) The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell metamagic feat, which can be cast as normal using the feat.

For a spell with a longer casting time, it takes an extra full-round action to cast the spell.

**Spontaneous Casting and Metamagic Feats** : A cleric spontaneously casting a cure or inflict spell, or a druid spontaneously casting a _summon nature's ally _spell, can cast a metamagic version of it instead. Extra time is also required in this case. Casting a standard action metamagic spell spontaneously is a full-round action, and a spell with a longer casting time takes an extra full-round action to cast. The only exception is for spells modified by the Quicken Spell feat, which can be cast as a swift action.

**Effects of Metamagic Feats on a Spell** : In all ways, a metamagic spell operates at its original spell level, even though it is prepared and cast using a higher-level spell slot. Saving throw modifications are not changed unless stated otherwise in the feat description.

The modifications made by these feats only apply to spells cast directly by the feat user. A spellcaster can't use a metamagic feat to alter a spell being cast from a wand, scroll, or other device.

Metamagic feats that eliminate components of a spell don't eliminate the attack of opportunity provoked by casting a spell while threatened. Casting a spell modified by Quicken Spell does not provoke an attack of opportunity.

Metamagic feats cannot be used with all spells. See the specific feat descriptions for the spells that a particular feat can't modify.

**Multiple Metamagic Feats on a Spell** : A spellcaster can apply multiple metamagic feats to a single spell. Changes to its level are cumulative. You can't apply the same metamagic feat more than once to a single spell.

**Magic Items and Metamagic Spells** : With the right item creation feat, you can store a metamagic version of a spell in a scroll, potion, or wand. Level limits for potions and wands apply to the spell's higher spell level (after the application of the metamagic feat). A character doesn't need the metamagic feat to activate an item storing a metamagic version of a spell.

**Counterspelling Metamagic Spells** : Whether or not a spell has been enhanced by a metamagic feat does not affect its vulnerability to counterspelling or its ability to counterspell another spell (see [Magic](magic.html)).

# Feat Descriptions

Feats are summarized on Table: Feats below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats on this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats description for full details.

The following format is used for all feat descriptions.

**Feat Name** : The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.

**Prerequisite** : A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisite. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.

**Benefit** : What the feat enables the character (âyouâ in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.

**Normal:** What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

**Special:** Additional unusual facts about the feat.

## Acrobatic

You are skilled at leaping, jumping, and flying.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on all [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics) and [Fly](skills/fly.html#_fly) skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.

## Acrobatic Steps

You can easily move over and through obstacles.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 15, Nimble Moves.

**Benefit:** Whenever you move, you may move through up to 15 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. The effects of this feat stack with those provided by Nimble Moves (allowing you to move normally through a total of 20 feet of difficult terrain each round).

## Agile Maneuvers (Combat)

You've learned to use your quickness in place of brute force when performing combat maneuvers.

**Benefit:** You add your [Dexterity](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to your base attack bonus and size bonus when determining your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus) (see [Combat](combat.html)) instead of your Strength bonus.

**Normal:** You add your Strength bonus to your base attack bonus and size bonus when determining your [Combat Maneuver Bonus](combat.html#_combat-maneuver-bonus).

## Alertness

You often notice things that others might miss.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on [Perception](skills/perception.html#_perception) and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive) skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.

## Alignment Channel

Choose chaos, evil, good, or law. You can channel divine energy to affect outsiders that possess this subtype.

**Prerequisites:** Ability to channel energy.

**Benefit:** Instead of its normal effect, you can choose to have your ability to channel energy heal or harm outsiders of the chosen alignment subtype. You must make this choice each time you channel energy. If you choose to heal or harm creatures of the chosen alignment subtype, your channel energy has no effect on other creatures. The amount of damage healed or dealt and the DC to halve the damage is otherwise unchanged.

**Special:** You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take this feat, it applies to a new alignment subtype. Whenever you channel energy, you must choose which type to effect.

If you use channel energy in this way, it has no other effect (it does not heal or harm nearby creatures).

You attract followers to your cause and a companion to join you on your adventures.

**Prerequisite:** Character level 7th.

**Benefits:** This feat enables you to attract a loyal cohort and a number of devoted subordinates who assist you. A cohort is generally an NPC with class levels, while followers are typically lower level NPCs. See Table: Leadership for what level of cohort and how many followers you can recruit.

**Leadership Modifiers:** Several factors can affect your Leadership score, causing it to vary from the base score (character level + [Cha](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier). Your reputation (from the point of view of the cohort or follower you are trying to attract) raises or lowers your Leadership score:

  
  

<thead><tr>
<th>Leader's Reputation</th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr></thead><tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Great renown</td>
<td>+2</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Fairness and generosity</td>
<td>+1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Special power</td>
<td>+1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Failure</td>
<td>–1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>Aloofness</td>
<td>–1</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Cruelty</td>
<td>–2</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
  
  

Other modifiers may apply when you try to attract a cohort, as listed below.

  
  

<thead><tr>
<th>The Leader... </th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr></thead>| Has a familiar, special mount, or animal companion | –2 |
| Recruits a cohort of a different alignment | –1 |
| Caused the death of a cohort | –2\* |
<tfoot><tr><td colspan="2">* Cumulative per cohort killed.</td></tr></tfoot>
  
  

Followers have different priorities from cohorts. When you try to attract a follower, use the following modifiers.

  
  

<thead><tr>
<th>The Leader... </th>
<th>Modifier</th>
</tr></thead>| Has a stronghold, base of operations, guildhouse, etc. | +2 |
| Moves around a lot | –1 |
| Caused the death of other followers | –1 |

  
  

_Leadership Score_: Your base Leadership score equals your level plus your [Charisma](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. In order to take into account negative [Charisma](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifiers, this table allows for very low Leadership scores, but you must still be 7th level or higher in order to gain the Leadership feat. Outside factors can affect your Leadership score, as detailed above.

_Cohort Level_: You can attract a cohort of up to this level. Regardless of your Leadership score, you can only recruit a cohort who is two or more levels lower than yourself. The cohort should be equipped with gear appropriate for its level (see [Creating NPCs](creatingNPCs.html)). A cohort can be of any race or class. The cohort's alignment may not be opposed to your alignment on either the law/chaos or good/evil axis, and you take a –1 penalty to your Leadership score if you recruit a cohort of an alignment different from your own.

A cohort does not count as a party member when determining the party's XP. Instead, divide the cohort's level by your level. Multiply this result by the total XP awarded to you, then add that number of experience points to the cohort's total.

If a cohort gains enough XP to bring it to a level one lower than your level, the cohort does not gain the new level—its new XP total is 1 less than the amount needed to attain the next level.

_Number of Followers by Level_: You can lead up to the indicated number of characters of each level. Followers are similar to cohorts, except they're generally low-level NPCs. Because they're usually 5 or more levels behind you, they're rarely effective in combat.

Followers don't earn experience and thus don't gain levels. When you gain a new level, consult Table: Leadership to determine if you acquire more followers, some of whom may be higher level than the existing followers. Don't consult the table to see if your cohort gains levels, however, because cohorts earn experience on their own.

You can create magic items using these feats, substituting your ranks in the chosen skill for your total caster level. You must use the chosen skill for the check to create the item. The DC to create the item still increases for any necessary spell requirements (see the magic item creation rules in [Magic Items](magicItems.html)). You cannot use this feat to create any spell-trigger or spell-activation item.

**Normal:** Only spellcasters can qualify for the Craft Magic Arms and Armor and Craft Wondrous Item feats.

## Maximize Spell (Metamagic)

Your spells have the maximum possible effect.

**Benefit:** All variable, numeric effects of a spell modified by this feat are maximized. Saving throws and opposed rolls are not affected, nor are spells without random variables. A maximized spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

An empowered, maximized spell gains the separate benefits of each feat: the maximum result plus half the normally rolled result.

## Medusa's Wrath (Combat)

You can take advantage of your opponent's confusion, delivering multiple blows.

**Prerequisites:** Improved Unarmed Strike, Gorgon's Fist, Scorpion Style, base attack bonus +11.

**Benefit:** You get a +4 [dodge bonus](combat.html#_dodge-bonuses) to [Armor Class](combat.html#_armor-class) against attacks of opportunity caused when you move out of or within a threatened area. A condition that makes you lose your [Dexterity](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to [Armor Class](combat.html#_armor-class) (if any) also makes you lose [dodge bonus](combat.html#_dodge-bonuses)es.

[Dodge bonus](combat.html#_dodge-bonuses)es stack with each other, unlike most types of bonuses.

## Mounted Archery (Combat)

You are skilled at making ranged attacks while mounted.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.

**Benefit:** The penalty you take when using a ranged weapon while mounted is halved: –2 instead of –4 if your mount is taking a double move, and –4 instead of –8 if your mount is running.

## Mounted Combat (Combat)

You are adept at guiding your mount through combat.

**Prerequisite:** Ride 1 rank.

**Benefit:** Once per round when your mount is hit in combat, you may attempt a Ride check (as an immediate action) to negate the hit. The hit is negated if your Ride check result is greater than the opponent's attack roll.

You can cast spells even while in a form that cannot normally cast spells.

**Prerequisites:** [Wis](gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) 13, wild shape class feature.

**Benefit:** You can complete the verbal and somatic components of spells while using wild shape. You substitute various noises and gestures for the normal verbal and somatic components of a spell.

## Nimble Moves

You can move across a single obstacle with ease.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 13.

**Benefit:** Whenever you move, you may move through 5 feet of difficult terrain each round as if it were normal terrain. This feat allows you to take a 5-foot step into difficult terrain.

Your attacks are capable of penetrating the defenses of some creatures.

**Prerequisites:** Weapon Focus, base attack bonus +1, 12th-level fighter, proficiency with weapon.

**Benefit:** Your attacks with weapons selected with Weapon Focus ignore up to 5 points of damage reduction. This feat does not apply to damage reduction without a type (such as DR 10/—).

## Persuasive

You are skilled at swaying attitudes and intimidating others into your way of thinking.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy) and [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate) skill checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.

You can target the weak points in your opponent's armor.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 19, Improved Precise Shot, Point-Blank Shot, Precise Shot, base attack bonus +16.

## Point-Blank Shot (Combat)

You are especially accurate when making ranged attacks against close targets.

**Benefit:** You get a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls with ranged weapons at ranges of up to 30 feet.

## Power Attack (Combat)

You can make exceptionally deadly melee attacks by sacrificing accuracy for strength.

**Prerequisites:** [Str](gettingStarted.html#_strength) 13, base attack bonus +1.

**Benefit:** You can choose to take a –1 penalty on all melee attack rolls and combat maneuver checks to gain a +2 bonus on all melee damage rolls. This bonus to damage is increased by half (+50%) if you are making an attack with a two-handed weapon, a one handed weapon using two hands, or a primary natural weapon that adds 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier on damage rolls. This bonus to damage is halved (–50%) if you are making an attack with an off-hand weapon or secondary natural weapon. When your base attack bonus reaches +4, and every 4 points thereafter, the penalty increases by –1 and the bonus to damage increases by +2. You must choose to use this feat before making an attack roll, and its effects last until your next turn. The bonus damage does not apply to touch attacks or effects that do not deal hit point damage.

## Precise Shot (Combat)

You are adept at firing ranged attacks into melee.

**Prerequisite:** Point-Blank Shot.

A character who has selected this feat may throw weapons at his full normal rate of attacks (much like a character with a bow).

Alchemical items, potions, scrolls, and wands cannot be drawn quickly using this feat.

**Normal:** Without this feat, you may draw a weapon as a move action, or (if your base attack bonus is +1 or higher) as a free action as part of movement. Without this feat, you can draw a hidden weapon as a standard action.

## Quicken Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast spells in a fraction of the normal time.

**Benefit:** Casting a quickened spell is a swift action. You can perform another action, even casting another spell, in the same round as you cast a quickened spell. A spell whose casting time is more than 1 round or 1 full-round action cannot be quickened.

A quickened spell uses up a spell slot four levels higher than the spell's actual level. Casting a quickened spell doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity.

**Special:** You can apply the effects of this feat to a spell cast spontaneously, so long as it has a casting time that is not more than 1 full-round action, without increasing the spell's casting time.

## Rapid Reload (Combat)

Choose a type of crossbow (hand, light, or heavy). You can reload such weapons quickly.

**Prerequisite:** Weapon Proficiency (crossbow type chosen).

**Benefit:** The time required for you to reload your chosen type of crossbow is reduced to a free action (for a hand or light crossbow) or a move action (for a heavy crossbow). Reloading a crossbow still provokes an attack of opportunity.

If you have selected this feat for hand crossbow or light crossbow, you may fire that weapon as many times in a full-attack action as you could attack if you were using a bow.

**Normal:** A character without this feat needs a move action to reload a hand or light crossbow, or a full-round action to reload a heavy crossbow.

**Special:** You can gain Rapid Reload multiple times. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a new type of crossbow.

## Rapid Shot (Combat)

You can make an additional ranged attack.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 13, Point-Blank Shot.

**Prerequisites:** Ride 1 rank, Mounted Combat.

**Benefit:** When you are mounted and use the charge action, you may move and attack as if with a standard charge and then move again (continuing the straight line of the charge). Your total movement for the round can't exceed double your mounted speed. You and your mount do not provoke an attack of opportunity from the opponent that you attack.

## Run

You are swift of foot.

**Benefit:** When running, you move five times your normal speed (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or four times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load). If you make a jump after a running start (see the Acrobatics skill description), you gain a +4 bonus on your Acrobatics check. While running, you retain your [Dexterity](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to your [Armor Class](combat.html#_armor-class).

**Normal:** You move four times your speed while running (if wearing medium, light, or no armor and carrying no more than a medium load) or three times your speed (if wearing heavy armor or carrying a heavy load), and you lose your [Dexterity](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) bonus to [AC](combat.html#_armor-class).

## Scorpion Style (Combat)

You can perform an unarmed strike that greatly hampers your target's movement.

**Prerequisite:** Improved Unarmed Strike.

**Benefit:** To use this feat, you must make a single unarmed attack as a standard action. If this unarmed attack hits, you deal damage normally, and the target's base land speed is reduced to 5 feet for a number of rounds equal to your [Wisdom](gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier unless it makes a [Fortitude](combat.html#_fortitude) saving throw (DC 10 + 1/2 your character level + your [Wis](gettingStarted.html#_wisdom) modifier).

## Scribe Scroll (Item Creation)

You can create magic scrolls.

**Prerequisite:** Caster level 1st.

**Benefit:** You can create a scroll of any spell that you know. Scribing a scroll takes 2 hours if its base price is 250 gp or less, otherwise scribing a scroll takes 1 day for each 1,000 gp in its base price. To scribe a scroll, you must use up raw materials costing half of this base price. See the magic item creation rules in [Magic Items](magicItems.html) for more information.

## Selective Channeling

You can choose whom to affect when you channel energy.

**Prerequisite:** [Cha](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) 13, channel energy class feature.

**Benefit:** When you channel energy, you can choose a number of targets in the area up to your [Charisma](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. These targets are not affected by your channeled energy.

**Normal:** All targets in a 30-foot burst are affected when you channel energy. You can only choose whether or not you are affected.

## Self-Sufficient

You know how to get along in the wild and how to effectively treat wounds.

**Benefit:** You get a +2 bonus on all [Heal](skills/heal.html#_heal) checks and [Survival](skills/survival.html#_survival) checks. If you have 10 or more ranks in one of these skills, the bonus increases to +4 for that skill.

Opponents who cannot move back due to a wall or other surface are knocked [prone](glossary.html#_prone) after moving the maximum possible distance. You may choose to move with your target if you are able to take a 5-foot step or to spend an action to move this turn.

## Silent Spell (Metamagic)

The DC for this [Will](combat.html#_will) save is equal to 10 + 1/2 your cleric level + your [Charisma](gettingStarted.html#_charisma-new) modifier. Undead that fail their save flee for 1 minute.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 13, [Int](gettingStarted.html#_intelligence) 13, Combat Expertise, Dodge, Mobility, Spring Attack, base attack bonus +4.

**Benefit:** When you use the full-attack action, you can give up your regular attacks and instead make one melee attack at your highest base attack bonus against each opponent within reach. You must make a separate attack roll against each opponent.

When you use the Whirlwind Attack feat, you also forfeit any bonus or extra attacks granted by other feats, spells, or abilities.

## Widen Spell (Metamagic)

You can cast your spells so that they occupy a larger space.

**Benefit:** You can alter a burst, emanation, or spread-shaped spell to increase its area. Any numeric measurements of the spell's area increase by 100%. A widened spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level.

Spells that do not have an area of one of these four sorts are not affected by this feat.

## Wind Stance (Combat)

Your erratic movements make it difficult for enemies to pinpoint your location.

**Prerequisites:** [Dex](gettingStarted.html#_dexterity) 15, Dodge, base attack bonus +6.

**Benefit:** If you move more than 5 feet this turn, you gain 20% concealment for 1 round against ranged attacks.
