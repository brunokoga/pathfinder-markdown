Giant crab spiders are dangerous ambush predators that live in dense forest vegetation. Though crab spiders are not web spinners, they are truly gifted climbers and use this talent to clamber up into places where they can observe wide areas from on high. Named for their curious scuttling walk and wide-legged stance, giant crab spiders are rarely larger than a typical adult halfling.

Ogre spiders are brutal, terrifying hunters that spin tangled webs capable of encasing entire trees. So-named because the arrangement of its eyes and mandibles gives it a face unnervingly similar to that of an ogre as much as for their size, ogre spiders can fit into nooks and tunnels far more narrow than one might expect.
