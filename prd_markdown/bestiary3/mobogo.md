Special Abilities

**Swamp Stride (Ex)** A mobogo can move through any sort of natural difficult terrain at its normal speed while within a swamp. Magically altered terrain affects it normally.

**Tongue (Ex)** A mobogo's tongue is a primary attack with reach equal to three times the mobogo's normal reach (45 feet for a typical mobogo). A mobogo does not gain the grappled condition when using its tongue to grapple a foe.

**Vile Croak (Su)** As a standard action once every 1d4 rounds, a mobogo can unleash a thunderous croak. Any non-boggard or non-mobogo within 50 feet of the mobogo must make a DC 19 Will save or become staggered for 1d4 rounds. Once a creature makes its saving throw against a particular mobogo's vile croak, it is immune to that mobogo's croak for 24 hours. Any boggards or mobogos within the area of a mobogo's vile croak gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls and saving throws against [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effects for 1 round. The save DC is Charisma-based.

Huge and hungry, mobogos merge the features of gigantic toads and swampy dragons, and lair in the deepest, oldest swamps. Here, whole tribes of boggards serve the beasts' fickle, capricious whims.

Mobogos reside in the most primal swamps of the world, grotesque eldritch wildernesses unchanged for centuries. Boggards believe that in ancient times, after their fecund demon goddess deposited her frogspawn in the muddy morass of the world's still-forming continents, mobogos were among the first creatures to emerge. Ever since, the mobogos have slept and fed, preying upon the beasts of their fetid meres, growing huge and lethargic, and dreaming inscrutable amphibious dreams of their godly mother's return. Nearly all mobogos are attended by tribes of boggards. Mobogos care little for matters of origins and philosophies—they care only for the endless sacrifices of food, victims, and pleasing swamp art brought to them by their obedient tribes.

A mobogo is 18 feet tall and weighs 12,000 pounds.
