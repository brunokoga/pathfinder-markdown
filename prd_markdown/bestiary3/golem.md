Special Abilities

**Bone Prison (Ex)** As a standard action, a bone golem can throw some of its bones at a creature within 30 feet—it must make a ranged touch attack to hit. These bones magically duplicate and form a cage surrounding struck creatures. Each round, the cage makes a combat maneuver check to deal the golem's slam damage, using the golem's CMB. If the check fails, the target is still trapped but takes no damage. The target can escape the grapple normally, or can break out of the bones by dealing 15 points of damage to the prison, which has the same AC, DR, and saves as the bone golem itself. Damage to the prison has no effect on the golem. The golem can only have one bone prison active at a time. If it wishes to create a second one, it (or some other creature) must first destroy the existing one.

**[Immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to Magic (Ex)** A bone golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_resistance). In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below.

•Magical effects that heal living creatures slow a bone golem (as the [_slow_](spells/slow#_slow) spell) for 1d4 rounds (no save).

•A magical attack that deals negative energy damage breaks any _slow_ effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for every 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A bone golem gets no saving throw against attacks that deal negative energy damage.

•A _ [raise dead](spells/raiseDead#_raise-dead)_, _ [resurrection](spells/resurrection#_resurrection)_, or _ [true resurrection](spells/trueResurrection#_true-resurrection)_ spell negates its DR and [immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to magic for 1 minute.

Bone golems are most often crafted as guardians of tombs—and sometimes formed from the very corpses they guard.

## Construction

The golem's body consists of bones from at least a dozen Medium or larger skeletons. The bones must be treated with oils and shellac worth 1,000 gp.

Special Abilities

**Brass Falchion (Ex)** A brass golem's falchion deals damage as a Huge falchion, but is actually a primary natural attack, not a manufactured weapon, and cannot be disarmed.

**[Breath Weapon](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_breath-weapon) (Su)** As a free action once every 1d4 rounds, a brass golem can expel a cloud of smoke and cinders that fills a 20-foot cube. This functions as an _ [incendiary cloud](spells/incendiaryCloud#_incendiary-cloud)_ that persists for 1d6 rounds, dealing 6d6 points of [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Death Throes (Ex)** A brass golem explodes when it is destroyed. All creatures within 30 feet of the golem take 12d8 points of [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) damage (DC 20 Reflex for half). The save DC is Constitution-based.

**[Immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to Magic (Ex)** A brass golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_resistance). In addition, certain spells and effects function differently against the creature.

•A magical attack that deals [cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype) damage slows a brass golem (as per the [_slow_](spells/slow#_slow) spell) for 1d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

•A magical attack that deals [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) damage breaks any _slow_ effect on the golem and heals 1 point of damage for each 3 points of damage the attack would otherwise deal. If the amount of healing would cause the golem to exceed its full normal hit points, it gains any excess as temporary hit points. A brass golem gets no save against [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) effects.

Implacable automatons of elemental fire and extraplanar brass, brass golems stand sentinel over the palaces, treasuries, and harems of their creators. Brass golems are 24 feet tall and weigh 18,000 pounds.

## Construction

Crafting a brass golem requires 18,000 pounds of brass, cast with several rare mineral solutions and ore compounds that cost at least 20,000 gp.

Special Abilities

**Alloyed (Ex)** A cannon golem's slam and cannon attacks count as adamantine, [cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype) iron, and silver for the purpose of overcoming [damage reduction](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_damage-reduction-(ex-or-su)).

**Blasting Critical (Ex)** When a cannon golem confirms a critical hit with a slam attack, it can make one cannon attack against that target as a free action (as long as the cannon is loaded).

**Cannon (Ex)** The golem's cannon has a range increment of 100 feet and deals 6d6 points of bludgeoning and piercing damage on a hit with a ×4 critical modifier. The cannon's magazine can hold up to 20 cannonballs at a time—reloading a single cannonball into this magazine is a standard action for the golem, while loading a cannonball into the cannon itself to [fire](monsters/creatureTypes#_fire-subtype) it is a swift action; this allows the golem to take two shots per round with the cannon.

**Gun Training (Ex)** A cannon golem adds its Dex modifier to the damage dealt by its cannon.

**[Immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to Magic (Ex)** A cannon golem is immune to spells and spell-like abilities that allow spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_resistance). Certain spells and effects function differently against it, as noted below.

•Any spell with the [water](monsters/creatureTypes#_water-subtype) descriptor that affects a cannon golem renders its cannon unusable for 1 round (no save).

•A _ [heat metal](spells/heatMetal#_heat-metal)_ spell causes the golem's cannon to instantly backfire, dealing 6d6 points of damage to the golem and staggering it for 1 round (no save).

A cannon golem's internal workings are a mechanical labyrinth; its extradimensional pockets constantly process new black powder. A cannon golem stands 12 feet tall.

## Construction

A cannon golem is built from 2,000 pounds of adamantine, brass, cold iron, and mithral.

Special Abilities

**[Immunity](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_immunity-(ex-or-su)) to Magic (Su)** A fossil golem is immune to any spell or spell-like ability that allows spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_resistance). In addition, certain spells and abilities function differently against the creature, as noted below.

•A _ [transmute rock to mud](spells/transmuteRockToMud#_transmute-rock-to-mud) _spell slows a fossil golem (as the [_slow_](spells/slow#_slow) spell) for 2d6 rounds, with no saving throw.

•A _ [stone to flesh](spells/stoneToFlesh#_stone-to-flesh)_ spell negates its [damage reduction](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_damage-reduction-(ex-or-su)) and petrification ability for 1 round.

**Petrification (Su)** The attacks of a fossil golem gradually turn living flesh to stone. Each time the golem hits a target with one of its natural attacks, the target must make a DC 19   
Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Dexterity drain. A creature that is reduced to 0 Dexterity by this attack turns completely to stone, as if by a _ [flesh to stone](spells/fleshToStone#_flesh-to-stone)_ spell. Casting _ [stone to flesh](spells/stoneToFlesh#_stone-to-flesh)_ on the creature removes all Dexterity drain caused by this attack. The save DC is Constitution-based and includes a +2 racial bonus.

A fossil golem is constructed of the stony bones of long-dead dinosaurs and other prehistoric creatures. These bones are generally not assembled with any attempt to accurately model the original creature—usually, the skulls of powerful predatory dinosaurs (such as tyrannosauruses) serve in the place of hands, granting the fossil golem a pair of devastating bite attacks. The magical energies that infuse a fossil golem create an additional peril—they transform fossilization into a terrible form of contagion that can affect any creature they damage.

Fossil golems are often used to guard caverns and other natural fortifications. A fossil golem at rest might look to the untrained eye like nothing more than a strange display of bones. A fossil golem is 20 feet tall and weighs 8,000 pounds.

## Construction

A fossil golem must be constructed from the fossilized skeletons of at least two creatures of Huge size or greater. The fossilized bone making up the golem requires extensive preservation and reassembly with alchemical solutions at a cost of 5,000 gp.
