SPECIAL ABILITIES

**All-Seeing Attacks (Ex)** A jotund troll can make nine additional attacks of opportunity in a round, one for each head, although no more than a single attack for any given opportunity.

**Cacophonous Roar (Su)** Once every 1d4 rounds as a standard action, a jotund troll can emit a cacophonous roar from its nine heads. All creatures within a 60-foot spread of the troll must make a DC 19 Will save or become confused for 1d4 rounds. This is a mind-affecting effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Multiple Minds (Ex)** A jotund troll has nine different minds that are in constant communication with each other. The resulting jumble of tangled thoughts grants the troll a   
+4 racial bonus on all Will saving throws against mind-affecting effects. In addition, whenever a jotund troll must make a Will save, it can roll the saving throw twice and take the better of the two results as its actual saving throw.

Jotund trolls are gigantic, nine-headed horrors. Prowling frigid moors and marshes, these rapacious creatures have the same insatiable appetites of common trolls but require much more sustenance because of their excessive size. Jotund trolls stand 30 feet tall and weigh roughly 25,000 pounds. They can live for up to 100 years.

The jotund troll's nine heads each have their own brains and senses, but they share, after a fashion, the same mind. Despite this, a jotund troll's heads often argue and bicker, particularly over which head gets to eat. The fact that all nine maws lead to the same shared stomach makes little difference in such culinary disagreements.

Jotund trolls spawn with either their own kind or with other trolls. In the latter case, there is only a 5% chance the offspring will be a jotund troll. Apart from brief mating periods, jotund trolls are solitary, although some cull together bands of other giants into devastating war parties that can lay waste to entire regions.

Special Abilities

**[Fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) of [Fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) (Ex)** A moss troll is shaken as long as it is within 30 feet of a visible [fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype) or an open flame of at least torch size.

**Tree Climber (Ex)** When climbing trees and other foliage, a moss troll's climb speed increases to 30 feet. If a moss troll falls while climbing in trees, it ignores the first 30 feet it falls for the purposes of calculating total damage from the fall. While climbing in trees, a moss troll gains a +4 racial bonus on initiative checks.

Moss trolls are bent and gangly creatures. They are smaller and thinner than normal trolls, yet their arms are unusually long and spindly for the creatures' size. Their flesh supports the growth of moss and mold as surely as tree bark.

Although their appetites are notoriously powerful, moss trolls are sly killers rather than simple brutes. They travel in the trees, singing, climbing, and jumping with unnerving ease. When a moss troll spots prey, it reaches or leaps down from above, heedless of dropping great distances in its eagerness to sate its ravenous appetite.

Moss trolls are fearless except in the face of fire, which does not stop a hungry moss troll from attacking, but can often cause a wounded one to retreat. However, those who fight moss trolls may be unpleasantly surprised to learn that acid has no special effect on a moss troll's regeneration.

Moss trolls not only hunt from the trees, but also live, breed, and hide their treasure among the branches. Their weirdly long arms allow them to attack foes on the ground without ever needing to set foot on the earth themselves. Young moss trolls are adept at climbing and acrobatics, as much as they are at eating and killing. Like other trolls, adult moss trolls often drive juveniles away after training them to hunt and fight. Gangs and troops of moss trolls exist only where food is plentiful. While moss trolls can digest almost any organic material, they prefer fresh meat—particularly when said meat is served still alive and squirming after a particularly invigorating session of stalking and torture.

A moss troll is 9 feet tall and weighs 550 pounds.
