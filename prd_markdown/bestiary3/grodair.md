Special Abilities

**Death Flood (Su)** When a grodair is killed, it immediately explodes in a 15-foot-radius burst of highly pressurized water that deals 5d6 points of damage (DC 17 Reflex for half). After the explosion, a successful DC 25 [Survival](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival) check allows a creature to recover a cluster of strange organs from the remains. This cluster functions as a _ [decanter of endless water](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_decanter-of-endless-water)_ for 2d6 hours, but can only produce a âstreamâ or âfountainâ effect. Failing this [Survival](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival) check by 5 or more causes the cluster to burst, dealing an additional 2d6 points of damage to that creature (no save) and destroying the organs entirely. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Muddy Field (Su)** As a standard action when on sand, soil, or other types of loose [earth](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_earth-subtype), a grodair can gush standing water into the area surrounding it. Upon doing so, the land within 15 feet of the grodair is treated as a shallow bog. This water remains as long as the grodair is within 15 feet and wishes to maintain the water. The bog instantly disperses as soon as the grodair is killed or moves out of the area.

**[Water](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_water-subtype) Blast (Ex)** The grodair's ranged attack is a pressurized blast of water. This attack has a range of 60 feet with no range increment.

A grodair is a bloated aquatic creature from the primal world of the fey. The bulbous sac on its spine is an extradimensional space that can contain thousands of gallons of water. The creature drains water (including small   
bits of debris and even very small creatures) from one place and releases it in another, typically creating boggy areas as it moves so it can travel more quickly than its tentacles can carry it. A grodair can rise up to 6 feet on its tentacles, measures 7 feet long, and weighs about 400 pounds.

A grodair is intelligent, but extremely absentminded and careless. Its memory is poor, and it has difficulty remembering things it was told even 5 minutes prior—though it can recall some events of the distant past with perfect (and often frustrating) clarity.
