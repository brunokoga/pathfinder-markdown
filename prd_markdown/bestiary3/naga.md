SPECIAL ABILITIES

**Hypnosis (Su)** Once per day, by weaving and coiling its body and hissing as a standard action, a lunar naga can cause its scales to shimmer and glow with moonlike radiance. All creatures within 30 feet must make a DC 17 Will save to avoid becoming fascinated. The lunar naga can maintain this fascination effect as long as it concentrates; fascinated creatures follow the still-glowing naga if it moves as long as it maintains the effect by concentrating. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**[Poison](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_poison-(ex-or-su)) (Ex)** Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 18; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ 1d3 Con and 1 Wis; _cure_ 1 save.

**Spells** A lunar naga casts spells as a 5th-level sorcerer.

Lunar nagas are patient watchers of the night sky. They enjoy cosmology and believe strongly in astrology, maintaining a handful of complex zodiacs. A few lunar nagas even bear knowledge of the unspeakable things from the dark spaces between the stars. A lunar naga stretches over 10 feet from its pale face to the tip of its tail, and weighs close to 200 pounds.

Nocturnal creatures, lunar nagas often live in ruined towers or atop mountains­—any place open to the sky at night. There they peer through astrological devices, closely monitoring passing celestial markers, eager to decipher more of the universe. Those living underground make nightly trips to the open sky when they can. Cloudy nights make lunar nagas agitated, and a creature is more likely to run afoul of a lunar naga on these dark evenings.

Lunar nagas sometimes lead small cults of sky-watchers. These followers aid the nagas in recording tome upon tome of calculations of the stars and planets moving through the inky black of the night sky. In small doses tempered with water, fruit juices, and alcohol, lunar naga venom is mildly hallucinogenic. The nagas' cultist allies often take the substance as a ritualistic drug.

Special Abilities

**[Change Shape](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_change-shape) (Su)** A royal naga can use this ability to take one of five specific humanoid forms. Each of these forms has a unique appearance (such as a female dwarf with red hair, an elderly male [human](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_human-subtype), and so on) and the naga can only use this ability to assume these five forms. The naga can still use its dual gaze in humanoid form.

**Dual Gaze (Su)** A royal naga has a piercing stare capable of crippling those that meet its gazes. The creature has two gaze attacks and can switch between them as a move action. One gaze causes those that succumb to it to become permanently blinded, while the other causes those that succumb to be permanently deafened. A DC 21 Fortitude save negates the effects of either gaze; otherwise, the effects are permanent until cured. Royal nagas generally prefer to keep their deafening gaze active, switching to the blindness gaze once combat begins and some of their foes have already been deafened, since those who are blinded can no longer be harmed by gaze attacks. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Spells** A royal naga casts spells as a 9th-level sorcerer.

Regal and proud, royal nagas haunt lost cities and forgotten kingdoms, guarding ancient treasures for their own inscrutable reasons. A royal naga's five faces are sharp and fierce, taking on a terrifying countenance when it becomes angered. Bespeaking their innate pride and vanity, royal nagas adorn their serpentine hoods and faces with elaborate and valuable piercings, crowns, or other precious accessories. Royal nagas are 18 feet long, and often weigh more than 750 pounds.

Royal nagas tend to be stern in nature and commanding in speech. Although naturally sociable, they are distrustful of strangers and seem to have great difficulty speaking to other creatures as equals.

**Spells** A water naga casts spells as a 7th-level sorcerer.

With mottled scales of blue and green, water nagas' serpentine beauty belies their deadliness. Although doubtlessly intelligent, these nagas have more in common with normal snakes than most of their kind, preferring to be left to their own devices and lashing out at any creatures that would disturb them. A typical water naga measures 10 feet long and weighs 250 pounds.

Where many nagas claim particular lairs as their homes, water nagas typically have a number of retreats, migrating from one to the next with the changing of the seasons. These nagas keep elaborate summer and winter lairs, with several favored shelters positioned between these so they can make a circuit of familiar rivers and coasts throughout the year. Fiercely territorial when it comes to their lairs, water nagas typically attack any that intrude upon their sanctuaries, only bothering to question interlopers once such creatures have been weakened by poison, if at all.

As their yearly treks make many water nagas especially well traveled, those who live near the serpents' lairs— usually lizardfolk, fey, and human tribes—often court the snake creatures' good graces with offerings of rich local delicacies, hoping to learn of nearby lands and pass on their own stories to distant neighbors. Enjoying flattery, exciting tales, and the adoration of those they see as lesser creatures, most water nagas take pride in their roles as travelers. However, while rarely malicious, they quickly grow bored of repetitive, mundane anecdotes and often embellish the stories they've heard with their own fictions—caring little for the repercussions such misleading tales might cause for their listeners. The congeniality of some water nagas does not extend to the entire race, and many unwary souls, even those with only the best intentions, face these serpentine creatures' deadly bite.
