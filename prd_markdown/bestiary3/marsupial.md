These strange-looking animals have long pointy ears and pronounced muzzles, and their strong legs carry them about in amazing leaps. Like all marsupials, kangaroos give birth to live young (âjoeysâ) that are relatively undeveloped at birth and completely helpless, and must remain within a protective pouch on the mother's belly for months before safely emerging.

While not particularly dangerous, a kangaroo is more than capable of defending itself if cornered or when forced to protect its young, striking out at foes with a powerful kick capable of knocking unwary antagonists off their feet.

A kangaroo stands over 6-1/2 feet tall and weighs upward of 200 pounds. To represent a smaller species standing about 4 feet tall and weighing 110 pounds, apply the young simple template or manually reduce the size from Medium to Small. Kangaroos reach maturity in less than a year and can live up to 20 years, but most individuals in the wild are hunted by predators within their first decade.

**Powerful Jaws (Ex)** A thylacine's muscular jaws threaten a critical hit on a natural roll of 19 or 20.

These carnivorous, wide-jawed marsupials typically hunt at night and have a reputation for savagery. By day, they nest in hollow trees or clusters of bushes.
