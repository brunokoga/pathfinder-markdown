Porcupines are omnivorous mammals that often climb trees in search of food. The spines on their back provide camouflage as well as protection from natural predators—typically other small mammals. Though primarily nocturnal, porcupines do occasionally graze during the day, eating the twigs, roots, and stems of bushes, coniferous trees, and other flora. Porcupine quills normally lie flat against the creature's body, but stand stiffly on end when the porcupine feels threatened.

**Quills (Ex)** Any creature attacking a [giant](monsters/creatureTypes#_giant-subtype) porcupine with light or one-handed melee weapons, natural weapons, or an unarmed strike takes 1d3 points of piercing damage.

More so than its smaller kin, the human-sized giant porcupine is a foul-tempered creature that is just as content chewing on carrion as on living creatures. Worse, giant porcupines are notorious in their almost foolhardy bravery, and have been known to attack creatures much larger than their own size. This unexpected aggression, when combined with their tangle of spearlike quills, makes the giant porcupine a dangerous foe.
