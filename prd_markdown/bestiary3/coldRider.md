Special Abilities

**Icewalking (Ex)** A [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) rider and any creature it rides can move across icy surfaces without penalty and do not need to make [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks to run or charge on ice. They may climb icy surfaces as if under the effects of the _ [spider climb](spells/spiderClimb.md#_spider-climb)_ spell.

**Implements of Ice (Su)** A [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) rider wears full plate armor and wields a _+2 [icy burst](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-icy-burst) glaive_ made of magical ice as hard as steel. Its armor has no armor check penalty. When a [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) rider dies, its armor and glaive melt into [water](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_water-subtype) in 1d6 rounds.

**Susceptible to Shatter (Ex)** A _ [shatter](spells/shatter.md#_shatter)_ spell deals 3d6 points of damage to a [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) rider (no save) and reduces its armor bonus by 2 for 1 minute. _ [Shatter](spells/shatter.md#_shatter)_ spells automatically overcome a [cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype) rider's spell [resistance](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_resistance).

Cold riders are terrifying armored majesties, clad in cloaks of frost with a pair of large crystal-blue antlers cresting their almost skeletal heads. Their icy armor and weapons are as much a part of them as their frozen flesh. Cold riders delight in perversion, slaughter, and the corruption of other fey. They prefer undead or cold-resistant steeds, but even when they have no access to such, their phantom steed spell-like ability ensures they never go long without a mount.

Cold riders are 7 feet tall, though their antlers easily add another 2 feet to their height. They weigh 300 pounds.
