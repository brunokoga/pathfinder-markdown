# Giant, Ash

Towering above a typical human, this misshapen giant's pale flesh is covered in purulent sores and bulbous tumors.

**Treasure** standard (hide armor, Huge club, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**[Disease](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_disease-(ex-or-su)) (Su)** While ash giants are immune to [disease](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/universalMonsterRules.html#_disease-(ex-or-su)), they carry a contagious form of leprosy. Any creature struck by an ash [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype)'s attacks is exposed to this virulent sickness.

_Ash Leprosy_: Injury; _save_ Fort 23; _onset_ 1 minute; _frequency_ 1 day; _effect_ 1d2 Con damage, 1d2 Cha drain; _cure_ 2 consecutive saves. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Oversized Weapon (Ex)** An ash [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) can wield Huge weapons without penalty.

**Vermin Empathy (Ex)** This ability functions as a druid's wild empathy ability, save that it works only on vermin. An ash [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) gains a racial bonus on this check equal to its Hit Dice (+14 for most ash giants). Vermin are normally mindless, but this empathic communication imparts upon them a modicum of implanted intelligence, allowing the ash [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) to train vermin and use them as guardians (although it does not grant them skills or feats).

Whether because of disruptive magic, unearthed deep elements, or alien technology that fell calamitously from the sky, ash giants are victims of their barren terrains. Yet they somehow survive and even thrive in these desperate lands. Ash giants have an uncanny ability to bond with the enormous and often mutated vermin they share the landscape with, and sometimes use the largest of these creatures as mounts.

Ash giants are brash and violent, and their humor is incredibly dark. Killing someone through a prank is just as funny as tripping a friend while on a hunt. While not inherently evil, lifetimes of being antagonized by other tribes have practically bred violence into their minds.

Ash giants are 10 feet tall and weigh 1,200 pounds.

**Organization** solitary, gang (2–5), band (6–8 plus 1–2 monitor lizards), raiding party (9–12 plus 1–4 monitor lizards), or tribe (13–20 plus 30% noncombatants, plus 1 barbarian, fighter, or ranger chief of 3rd–5th level; 2–9 monitor lizards; 1–4 [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) frilled lizards; and 10–15 dwarf, orc, or troglodyte slaves)

**Treasure** standard (battleaxe, hide armor, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Axe Wielder (Ex)** All cave giants are proficient with handaxes, battleaxes, and greataxes.

Stooped over in a perpetual crouch, cave giants move as if they had never mastered walking erect. Their faces mix the worst features of ogre and feral orc. The largest would measure 10 feet in height if they ever stood straight. The typical cave giant weighs 1,000 pounds. Though few survive past 60 years, cave giants can live as long as 150 years.

While they prove remarkably adept with axes of all varieties, cave giants lack the patience to work metal. What metal a cave giant possesses was likely stolen from other giants or worked by enslaved subterranean smiths.

Slaves such as dwarves, orcs, and troglodytes do most of the labor in cave giant settlements. Poor treatment and the need for meat keep slave populations small and ever-rotating. New slaves are brought in whenever raiding parties remember to reign in their blood lust. Any prisoners who fail to submit to their new masters find themselves served on the dinner table or tossed screaming into the giant's cave lizard pens.

Giant lizards of all types serve as both guard beasts and sport for the cave giants. Giant frilled lizards are rarely pets, as most cave giants opt to keep less dangerous monitor lizards instead. Kept in check only by fear and brutal beatings, such pets turn on their handlers at the first sign of weakness. At feeding time, live captives are tossed into the pens, a festive event filled with boisterous cheers and spirited betting.

**Treasure** standard (2 masterwork scimitars, leather armor, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Sandwalking (Ex)** A desert [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) travels at full speed across sand, rocky ground, or dust, and leaves no trail behind unless it chooses to.

**Scimitar Training (Ex)** All desert giants are proficient with scimitars, and can wield them as if they were light weapons. A desert [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) adds its full Strength bonus to attacks made with a scimitar wielded in its off hand, and gains a +4 bonus to CMD versus disarm and sunder attempts when fighting with a scimitar in each hand.

Desert giants rove the stark and majestic sands, rarely dwelling in permanent camps. They roam from oasis to oasis, sleeping beneath the stars or in easily dismantled yurts, breaking camp as whim strikes or when food sources grow scarce.

Desert giants stand 15 feet tall on average, but have slender builds and rarely weigh more than 2,000 pounds, a fact that greatly contributes to their grace and speed. The giants favor loose robes with keffiyehs for protection from the scouring desert winds, as well as traveling leathers worn beneath the robes. They require little water, and are able to survive for as long as 2 weeks on food alone. When such goods are available, they drink water, milk, and juices in prodigious amounts, but they spurn beer, wine, and stronger spirits. The bulk of their diet comes from figs, olives, and similar bounty of the oases, supplemented by meat if required. The eldest desert giants live as long as 300 years.

Despite their nomadic ways, desert giants guard their territory fiercely, driving away all interlopers, whether intelligent or bestial.

**Treasure** standard (masterwork composite longbow [+8 Str] with 40 arrows, other treasure)

Special Abilities

**Archery Expert (Su)** A jungle [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) is proficient with all bows, and does not provoke an attack of opportunity when firing a bow in melee combat.

**Spell Storing (Su)** Once per day as a immediate action, a jungle [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) can absorb a targeted or ranged touch spell used against it, negating the effects against it but not against any other targets. It can retain this stored power for up to 1 minute, during which time its tattoos glow with blue [fire](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_fire-subtype). If it damages a target with a successful hit using a melee or ranged weapon, it can cast the spell on the target as a free action, as if it were using a _ [spell storing](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_spell-storing) weapon_. This spell uses the caster level and DC of the original caster. This discharges the stored spell.

**Warding Tattoos (Su)** A jungle [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype)'s magical tattoos grant it a +4 deflection bonus to Armor Class. The [giant](/pathfinderRPG/prd/monsters/creatureTypes.html#_giant-subtype) loses this bonus if it wears armor.

Reclusive by nature, jungle giants lair deep within the rainforest. These giants distrust the ways of civilization and resent trespassers. More than one vine-covered lost city in the deep jungle owes its fall to jungle giant ire. The warrior-women of these tribes usually fight with bows, sacred weapons often passed down over generations from mother to daughter. To touch a jungle giant's bow without permission is a mortal insult.

Jungle giants stand 17 feet tall and weigh 4,000 pounds. Their barklike skin bears runic brands etched into each giant as a rite of passage into adulthood. Jungle giant tribes are matriarchal, ruled by an elder female warrior. Males traditionally defend the village, gather food, tend livestock, and raise children.
