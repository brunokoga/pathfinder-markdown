Special Abilities

**Change Shape (Su)** A jackalwere has three forms. Its natural form is that of a jackal, but it can also take the form of a human or a human-jackal hybrid. A jackalwere's human form is fixed—it cannot assume different human forms. A jackalwere can use its sleep [gaze](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_gaze) in any of its forms. In jackal form, it functions as a dog. In its hybrid form, a jackalwere can make a bite attack as a secondary attack, while in human form it lacks its bite attack entirely. A jackalwere can shift into any of its three alternate forms as a move action. Equipment does not meld with the new form between human and hybrid forms but does between those forms and its jackal form.

**Jackal Empathy (Ex)** A jackalwere can communicate and empathize with jackals (use stats for Small dog), and can use [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) as if it were [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy#_diplomacy) to change a jackal's attitude, receiving a +4 racial bonus to do so.

**Sleep (Su)** Sleep for 3 minutes (a standard action rouses the creature, as does damage), 30 feet, Will DC 12 negates. A creature that succeeds at the saving throw cannot be affected by the same jackalwere's sleep [gaze](monsters/universalMonsterRules#_gaze) for 24 hours. This is a sleep effect. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Weapon Intuition (Ex)** A jackalwere is proficient with simple and martial melee weapons.

Jackalweres are evil, supernatural jackals born with the ability to assume human form. Some folks superstitiously consider jackalweres to be emissaries of evil spirits or wicked desert gods, and it is easy to understand why, as they can take the shape of a human and possess a keen intellect; however, they also have a taste for murder and humanoid flesh.

In its hybrid form, a jackalwere stands 6 feet tall and weighs 150 pounds.
