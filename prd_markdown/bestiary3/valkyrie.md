Special Abilities

**Battle Trained (Ex)** A valkyrie is proficient with all armor. Armor never impacts a valkyrie's speed, nor does a valkyrie take armor check penalties on [Ride](/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/ride.html#_ride) checks.

**Choose the Slain (Su)** A valkyrie can draw the soul from a newly dead body and store it in her spear for transport to the Outer Planes. This functions as _ [soul bind](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/soulBind.html#_soul-bind)_, but the dead creature must be willing to have its soul taken. If the creature is unwilling, this ability has no effect.

**Holy Zeal (Su)** A valkyrie adds her Charisma modifier as a deflection bonus to her Armor Class.

Valkyries are outsiders who scour the battlefields of the Material Plane for warriors of great prowess and legendary renown. With a glance, a valkyrie can tell who is near death and ready to give up life and who fights on to live another day, and can either claim the soul of the slain or aid the living to continue the fight.

Valkyries are always female, and appear as strong and beautiful human, dwarven, or elven women. A human valkyrie is 6 feet tall and weighs close to 200 pounds.

Valkyries serve a variety of deities, though they are most often associated with the gods of war, conflict, valor, and courage. Although capable combatants in their own right, valkyries are almost always encountered mounted, typically on flying steeds such as dragon horses, pegasi, or sleipnirs.
