Special Abilities

**[Change Shape](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_change-shape) (Su)** A popobala loses its [frightful presence](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_frightful-presence), popobala fever, and stench abilities when not in its true form.

**Harvester of Sorrow (Su)** A popobala heals as a result of the suffering of others. It gains fast healing 10 if at least one creature within 15 feet has one or more of the following conditions: confused, cowering, dying, exhausted, fatigued, frightened, nauseated, panicked, shaken, sickened, staggered, or stunned.

**Horrid Haunting (Su)** A popobala may use _ [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound.md#_ghost-sound)_ or _ [ventriloquism](spells/ventriloquism.md#_ventriloquism)_ as a free action whenever it manipulates a creature or object with _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects.md#_animate-objects)_, _ [dominate person](spells/dominatePerson.md#_dominate-person)_, or _ [telekinesis](spells/telekinesis.md#_telekinesis)_. The _ [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound.md#_ghost-sound)_ or _ [ventriloquism](spells/ventriloquism.md#_ventriloquism)_ originates from the controlled object or creature.

**Popobala Fever (Su)** A creature wounded by a popobala's talons becomes sickened for 1d6 minutes unless it makes a DC 25 Fortitude save. A creature already sickened by the fever becomes nauseated for 1d6 rounds. One already nauseated by the fever is helpless for 1d6 rounds. This is a [disease](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_disease-(ex-or-su)) effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The popobala is a much-feared shapeshifter that haunts and hunts warm coastal lands, roaming night and day to terrorize and spread anarchy and unrest while slaking its insatiable twin urges for violence and prurience. Shifting freely between bat, human, and its natural form, the popobala is most dreaded for its mesmeric charms, but it is more than capable of engaging in savage bloodletting against those who anger it. Popobalas are attracted to chaos, anarchy, and unrest, as the intensity of emotions and uncertainty inflames its already fierce urges. War, changes of government, and religious or ethnic strife or persecution—all of these excite a popobala, and if a society remains too settled and stable, the beast is never above fomenting unrest through its own predations.

A typical popobala is 5 feet tall with a 12 foot wingspan. It weighs only 100 pounds.
