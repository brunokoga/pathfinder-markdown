Special Abilities

**Aura of Peace (Su)** Creatures within a 50-foot spread from a simurgh feel a sensation of peace wash over them, as if affected by _ [calm emotions](spells/calmEmotions.md#_calm-emotions)_, except the simurgh can choose which creatures are affected. A DC 28 Will save negates the effects of this aura for 1 round, but a new save must be made each round to continue to resist the effects. The saving throw is Charisma-based.

**Banishing Swipe (Su)** A simurgh can use its radiant tail to return creatures to their [native](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_native-subtype) planes. In addition to taking damage, any [extraplanar](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_extraplanar-subtype) creature touched by a simurgh's tail must succeed at a DC 28 Will save or be affected as if by _ [banishment](spells/banishment.md#_banishment)_. A creature that makes this save cannot be affected by the same simurgh's banishing swipe for the next 24 hours. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Glaring Ray (Su)** A simurgh can blast a fiery ray of brilliant light from its eyes as a standard action to a range of 100 feet.

**Radiant Feathers (Su)** Once per day as a standard action, a simurgh can fan out its glimmering tail feathers and blast its foes with a 100-foot cone of radiant light from its tail. Aside from its size, this attack is identical to a _ [prismatic spray](spells/prismaticSpray.md#_prismatic-spray)_ (DC 28). The save is Charisma-based.

Regarded as living legends, simurghs are held in high regard by desert dwellers. Those who live in the desert lands where these benevolent creatures sometimes reside consider it a lifetime's worth of luck even to spot one soaring through the sky. Simurghs prefer to keep to themselves, well out of the way of lesser creatures and their often dubious morals, though they can be relied upon for aid when called by those in true need and with a pure heart. A simurgh can live for thousands of years, and frequent mentions of these giant avian beings throughout a region's historical record are more often than not sightings of the same creature.
