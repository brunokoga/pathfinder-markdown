A typical antelope stands a bit less than 3 feet at the shoulder, measures 4 feet in length, and weighs 60 pounds. In some species, both males and females have horns; in others, only males. Females that lack horns have the same statistics but lack an effective attack.

Antelopes graze in large herds, ever on the watch for predators. Even the hint of a threat can send the whole herd springing away toward safer pastures. Antelopes rarely fight except among themselves during mating season or when cornered by a predator.

The statistics presented above work well not only for numerous species of antelope, but also for smaller-sized, deerlike herbivores found throughout the world.

Of course, not all antelopes are Small. You can generate statistics for larger antelope species, such as elands or kudus, by advancing the antelope presented above by 2 Hit Dice and increasing its size category to Medium. All antelopes of this size are CR 1 creatures.

# Herd Animal, Elk

This majestic beast stands the height of a man at its shoulders, a many-tipped rack of proud antlers crowning its head.

Elk range in great herds throughout the plains, hills, and forests of many wilderness areas. Their size, strength, and antlers allow them to contend with most of their environment's dangers, though herds generally favor flight to combat. Elk also prove exceptionally adaptable survivors, capable of living through severe weather changes without concern. Most breeds of elk stand between 3 and 5 feet tall and weigh between 350 and 550 pounds, with females far slighter than the males.

Numerous species of elk exist. Some larger species can stand up to 6 feet tall at the shoulder and can be used as mounts by Medium humanoids; these elk have 3 Hit Dice and are Large. One particularly unusual species of elk, the river elk, is an excellent swimmer—these elk gain a swim speed of 30 feet. All elk of this size are CR 2 creatures.
