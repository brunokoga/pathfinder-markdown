Special Abilities

**Sand Trap (Ex)** A [giant](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_giant-subtype) ant lion can create a 60-foot-diameter, 20-foot-deep pit in any sand or soft [earth](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_earth-subtype) surface. Creating a sand trap takes 1 hour. A DC 15 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check allows a creature to realize such a depression in the sand is in fact a trap. Any creature that steps into the trap slides to the center if it fails a DC 14 Reflex save—such victims take no damage, but they do fall prone. A [giant](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_giant-subtype) ant lion can make an attack of opportunity against any creature that falls to the bottom of its sand trap. These creatures can move across sand traps at their normal speed and are immune to the trap's effects. Other creatures can navigate the trap's walls with a DC 20 [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) check.

Perils of the desert depths, giant ant lions construct traps from the shifting sands. These beasts lurk at the base of these pits, half buried and patiently awaiting unwary prey.

When a giant ant lion reaches maturity, it creates a cocoon of sand and dirt around itself. Over the course of a month, the ant lion undergoes a dramatic metamorphosis—when it emerges, its body has become elongated and thin and it has gained a set of enormous, lacy wings. Depending on the region, giant adult ant lions are often called giant lacewings, giant damselflies, or giant spindleflies, but regardless of their regional name, they remain ravenous and deadly, replacing the sand trap cunning of their larval form with swift flight and greater battlefield mobility.
