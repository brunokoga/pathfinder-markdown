Special Abilities

**Chained Daggers (Su)** A crucidaemon fights with the two daggers chained to its wrists as if dual wielding daggers with a reach of 10 feet (although it can also attack adjacent foes with no penalty). It takes no penalty on attack or damage rolls while wielding both of these daggers at once. These daggers are considered to be _+2 daggers_ that deal 2d6 points of [bleed](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_bleed) damage. The daggers become nonmagical upon the [daemon](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_daemon-subtype)'s death, and cannot be disarmed. A crucidaemon may remanifest a destroyed dagger as a standard action.

**Trap Making (Ex)** A crucidaemon can use [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) to disarm magic traps. When it uses its _ [greater glyph of warding](spells/glyphOfWarding.md#_glyph-of-warding-greater)_ spell-like ability to create a spell glyph, it may utilize any 6th-level or lower spell from the cleric or the wizard spell list, even though it otherwise can't cast these spells. The [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) and [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) DCs for any traps a crucidaemon creates gain a +2 bonus.

Bloody representations of death by traps or torture, crucidaemons spend their existence subjecting creatures to an eternity of pain and terror. Whereas many daemons are quick to feed on the soul of mortals they capture, a crucidaemon lets its victims linger, marinating their souls in torment and pain so that when the time for feeding finally comes, they welcome their final oblivion with tears of gratitude.

Crucidaemons are 6 feet tall and weigh 250 pounds.

# Daemon, Vulnudaemon

A bloody, tooth-filled mouth that looks almost like a horrific gash gasps in the neck of this pale, childlike horror.

Special Abilities

**Aura of Doom (Su)** As a free action, a vulnudaemon can radiate an aura of dread and hopelessness. Any creature within 30 feet of the vulnudaemon must succeed at a DC 18 Will save or become shaken for as long as it remains in the aura.

These deceptive daemons personify death resulting from murder accented with betrayal. Most often formed from the souls of evil creatures killed by family or friends, vulnudaemons spread their insanity throughout the worlds by deceiving and killing all creatures they meet.

Vulnudaemons stalk their prey, infecting them with a sense of impending doom and watching their reactions, learning their responses before attacking and savoring their death. These daemons serve as excellent assassins, hiding in the shadows before debilitating their enemies, or striking from the protection of invisibility in order to deliver the killing blow. When facing stronger enemies, vulnudaemons seek to wear them down through a series of attacks, nicking at them and darting off, then repeating the process until their opponents bleed out.

Vulnudaemons often find themselves called to the Material Plane by cultists of deities associated with murder and assassination. These cultists often see vulnudaemons as sacred creatures favored by their deity, and rather than simply use the daemons as assassins, cultists often grant them a shocking degree of freedom to wander the region as they will, picking victims to fit their own agendas and murdering whomever they wish. Cultists who conjure vulnudaemons into the world usually take care to show the daemons a secret hand sign or other code that members of the cult can show them, lest the monsters decide to target one of the believers for an attack. Whether or not an accidentally targeted cultist has the time to flash her safety sign to the daemon should the creature attack her at a later date is, of course, another matter.

Vulnudaemons stand 3 feet tall and weigh 25 pounds.
