Special Abilities

**Darting Claw (Ex)** Evolved for snatching fast prey, a shark-eating crab is exceptionally quick with its claws. When making a full attack, if a shark-eating crab misses with both of its claw attacks, it can make an additional claw attack at a –2 penalty against any creature within its reach.

Extremely fast and agile for such a large creature, the shark-eating crab preys on predators of the sea. Not limiting its consumption to just sharks, these crabs feed on fast-moving fish like barracudas and tuna, and even mollusks like giant squid. Their hunting skills have evolved over the ages to track the movements of fast creatures swimming above them as the crabs blend into their surroundings.

The typical shark-eating crab stands 16 feet tall and weighs just over 4,000 pounds.

Special Abilities

**Powerful Claws (Ex)** A shipwrecker crab's claw attacks deal damage equal to 1-1/2 times its Strength modifier. In addition, a shipwrecker crab ignores up to 5 points of hardness when damaging objects.

A bane to all vessels traveling the seas, shipwrecker crabs can ruin the career of a merchant captain in minutes, destroying her ship, dumping its cargo into the waters below, and plucking her drowning crew from the wreckage for food.

Shipwrecker crabs live most of their lives in shallow seas, coming near the coast or surface to hunt and feed.

A shipwrecker crab measures 50 feet across, with two long arms capable of extending a further 30 feet each, and weighs 6 tons.
