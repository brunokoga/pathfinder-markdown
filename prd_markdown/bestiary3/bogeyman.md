Special Abilities

**Deepest [Fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) (Su)** A bogeyman is cloaked in a 30-foot aura of [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)). This aura manifests as a shifting haze of images that reflect the viewer's deepest fears. The first time it ends its turn within the aura, a creature must make a DC 25 Will save or become shaken for as long as it stays within the aura. If the creature succeeds at the saving throw, it cannot be affected again by the aura for another 24 hours. This is a [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Striking [Fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) (Su)** If a bogeyman confirms a critical hit or a sneak attack with one of its claws on a target currently suffering a [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect, that effect automatically becomes one step more severe (shaken creatures become frightened, frightened creatures become panicked, and panicked creatures cower in [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp))). A DC 25 Will save negates this increase. In addition, a critical hit from the bogeyman's claw forces any target that has successfully saved against the creature's [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) aura to make another Will save against its effects, even if 24 hours have not yet passed. This is a [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect. The DC is Charisma-based.

**Terrible Rejuvenation (Su)** A bogeyman gains fast healing 5 while any creature within its deepest [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) aura is suffering from a [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect, including any [fear](monsters/universalMonsterRules.md#_fear-(su-or-sp)) effect created by the aura itself.

Many believe that the most cruel and mischievous fey become bogeymen as a punishment or a reward for their actions. Others see bogeymen as supernatural manifestations of society's willingness to do itself harm.

Bogeymen use their powers to haunt houses or secluded natural places where they can hunt prey unobserved. They relish using their _ [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound.md#_ghost-sound)_ ability to hint at their presence long before they fully reveal themselves. It is not uncommon for a bogeyman to hide under a bed, or in a closet left slightly ajar, for days or even weeks, all the while feeding on its victims' growing realization that they are not alone.

The most evil bogeymen are those who abandon the tactic of feeding on one person's fears at a time and take up roles of mass murderers or serial killers, or other pursuits designed to drive fear into the hearts of an entire city of victims. True to their name, all bogeymen are male. Sometimes, children whom they steal away to secret lairs emerge years later, transformed into new bogeymen, and return home to continue their supernatural father's work.
