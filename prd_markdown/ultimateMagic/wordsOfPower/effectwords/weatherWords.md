## Weather Words

Words from the weather family control the forces of nature, summoning wind, rain, and snow.

Fog Bank (Weather)

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 1, druid 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_, _burst_ (emanation)

This effect word creates a thick fog in its area of effect. It obscures all sight, including darkvision, beyond 5 feet. Creatures 5 feet away have concealment, whereas creatures farther away have total concealment. A moderate wind or fire effect removes the fog in the affected area. The fog is stationary.

**Boost** : If a wordspell with this effect word uses the _burst_ target word, it can be directed to move up to 10 feet each round by the caster as a swift action.

Wind Blast (Weather)

**School** evocation [[air](monsters/creatureTypes#_air-subtype)]; **Level** druid 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _line_

This effect word creates a blast of air that can knock over or hinder those in its path. When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, any Large or smaller creature within the area of the wordspell must make a Fortitude save or be knocked prone and pushed back 10 feet. Any creature wishing to move through the line of air must make a DC 20 Strength check. Failure means the creature wastes 5 feet of movement, but is otherwise unhindered and can continue to move (so long as it does not move through the line of air). The DC increases to 30 if the creature attempts to move toward the source of the wind. Flying creatures take a –4 penalty on saves and Strength checks made against this effect.

Blizzard (Weather)

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** druid 3, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

This effect word causes heavy snow to fall in the area of effect. This provides concealment as the _fog bank _effect word, but it cannot be removed by wind. In addition, the ground in the area of effect is treated as difficult terrain for the duration and as being very slippery for the purposes of [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) and [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) skill checks.

**Boost** : Each creature in the area of effect takes 2d6 points of cold damage each round at the end of its turn. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 1.

Storm Master (Weather)

**School** transmutation; **Level** cleric 7, druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

**Duration** 1 hour/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _personal_

A word spell with this effect word grants the target the ability to alter the weather around it in a 1-mile radius. The target can change the conditions by shifting the weather one step at a time up or down a scale of weather effects. The scale is as follows: freezing cold, blizzard, snow, cold rain, cold wind, calm, warm wind, warm rain, thunderstorm, tornado, extreme heat. Each change takes 10 minutes to fully take effect. Thus if the weather currently features warm wind and the caster wanted to change that to cold wind, she would need to first change the weather to calm, and then to cold wind. The target cannot control the specifics of the weather, merely what type of weather is occurring (the target cannot, for example, make lightning strike a house, but it can cause lighting to strike within the area).

**Boost** : Each change in the weather takes only 5 minutes.
