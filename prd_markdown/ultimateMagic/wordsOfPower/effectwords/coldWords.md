## Cold Words

Spells using these words drain the warmth from the surrounding environment, leaving everything frozen and rimed with frost.

Cold Snap (Cold)

**School** evocation [[cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype)]; **Level** druid 0, magus 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d3 points of cold damage. If the wordspell with this effect word has only a single target, it requires a melee or ranged touch attack to hit and does not allow a saving throw.

Frost Fingers (Cold)

**School** evocation [[cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype)]; **Level** druid 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 5d6). A target that fails its saving throw is also staggered for 1 round.

Ice Blast (Cold)

**School** evocation [[cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype)]; **Level** druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

This effect deals 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). A target that fails its saving throw is entangled by the ice for 1d4 rounds.

Winter's Wrath (Cold)

**School** evocation [[cold](monsters/creatureTypes#_cold-subtype)]; **Level** druid 8, sorcerer/wizard 8

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude half; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _burst_

A wordspell with this effect word creates an area of blizzardlike conditions. Anyone inside the area when it forms, and at the start of the caster's turn, takes 1d6 points of cold damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and 1d4 points of Dexterity damage. A Fortitude save halves this damage and negates the Dexterity damage. Creatures immune to cold damage do not take the Dexterity damage. Because of the heavy snow and winds, visibility is reduced to 5 feet inside the blizzard. Effects that deal fire damage do not harm anyone inside this blizzard unless they are of a level equal to or higher than the wordspell with this effect word.
