## Acid Words

These words create caustic acid that scorches and burns all that it comes in contact with.

Acid Burn (Acid)

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level** druid 0, inquisitor 0, magus 0, sorcerer/wizard 0, summoner 0

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** no

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d3 points of acid damage. If the wordspell has only a single target, it requires a melee or ranged touch attack to hit and does not allow a saving throw.

Corrosive Bolt (Acid)

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level** magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2

**Duration** 1 round/level (see text)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _selected_

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d4 points of acid damage per level of the wordcaster (maximum 5d4). On the following round, the target takes this damage again. Hitting a target with a wordspell with this effect word requires a ranged touch attack.

Acid Wave (Acid)

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level** magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Duration** 2 rounds

**Saving Throw** Reflex half and partial (see below); **Spell Resistance** no

A wordspell with this effect word deals 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 10d6). Targets damaged by this effect word are sickened for 1 round per caster level, or 1 round if the saving throw against the wordspell with this effect word was successful.

Caustic Cloud (Acid)

**School** conjuration (creation) [acid]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 6

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude half; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _burst_

A wordspell with this effect word creates a cloud of noxious green vapor that obscures vision. Creatures caught in the cloud take 1d6 points of acid damage per caster level (maximum 20d6) and are fatigued. Creatures caught in the cloud receive a Fortitude save to halve the damage and to negate the fatigued effect. Creatures that remain in the cloud take a cumulative –2 penalty on the save each round they remain in the cloud, but spending just 1 round outside the cloud's area resets this penalty. Creatures in the cloud that are fatigued become exhausted on a failed saving throw. A strong wind, such as that created by a _ [gust of wind](spells/gustOfWind#_gust-of-wind)_, disperses this cloud immediately.
