## Divination Words

Words from this family uncover answers and scry across vast distances.

Beacon (Divination)

**School** divination; **Level** bard 0, druid 0, ranger 1

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _personal_

When a wordspell with this effect word is cast, the exact location of the caster becomes a fixed point. For the duration of the wordspell, the caster always knows the direction and distance to the point where this wordspell was cast. If this word is cast again, the original casting immediately ends. This effect does not instruct the caster on how to reach the point, but rather merely indicates the direction to the point, even if that direction leads through solid objects and other hazards.

Far Sight (Divination)

**School** divination (scrying); **Level** bard 3, cleric 3, druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _personal_

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word creates an invisible eye at any point within 400 feet + 40 feet per caster level. This sensor cannot move, but for the duration of the wordspell, the caster can look through this eye as if it were her own. The eye uses her senses, including magical ones, to allow her to see, including darkvision, low-light vision, or other effects, such as _sense magic_. The eye can view in all directions and cannot be destroyed if discovered.

**Boost** : This sensor can be placed anywhere on the same plane of existence as the caster, with no limit to range. The caster can place it to within 10 feet of a creature that is known to the caster, but the target gets a Will save to negate the effect in this case and the caster must overcome the target's spell resistance. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 2.

Locate (Divination)

**School** divination; **Level** bard 6, cleric 6, druid 6, inquisitor 6, witch 6

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _personal_

The caster of a wordspell with this effect word can name any location she has visited before or any object she has held before. For the duration of this wordspell, she always knows the direction of the named location or object. The direction is always the swiftest path to travel, leading her perfectly through mazes or other obstacles by the method the wordcaster is currently traveling, irrespective of danger.
