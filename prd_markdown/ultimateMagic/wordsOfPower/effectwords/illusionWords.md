## Illusion Words

These words deceive the senses, leaving those that witness them unsure of the world around them.

Echo (Illusion)

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 0, sorcerer/wizard 0

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

This effect word targets a single location, creating a sound that rises, recedes, or remains constant for the duration. The sound's volume increases with the caster's level. The base [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) DC to notice this sound is 0, but the DC is reduced by 1 per caster level (although it can be higher if the caster desires). This means that the sound starts out as loud as a creature talking, but by 10th level, it is as loud as creatures engaged in a noisy battle. The sound can resemble anything the caster desires, except it cannot replicate speech or language. Once cast, the type of sound within the emanation cannot be changed.

Glimmering (Illusion)

**School** illusion (figment); **Level** bard 2, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will disbelief; **Spell Resistance** no

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

This effect word creates a visual illusion centered on a target space within range. The illusion must be contained within the burst radius. This illusion only contains visual elements, and while it can move, its movements are repeated once per round. It can otherwise have any appearance the caster desires. The caster can change the illusion's movements by concentrating, but it cannot leave its initial area.
