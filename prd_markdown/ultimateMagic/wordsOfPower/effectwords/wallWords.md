## Wall Words

Wall words create large barriers that impede and harm those who pass through them.

Wind Wall (Wall)

**School** evocation [[air](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_air-subtype)]; **Level** cleric 3, druid 3, magus 3, ranger 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_

This effect word creates a vertical wall of swirling wind. This wind does not obscure sight, but missile weapons that pass through the wall automatically miss (with the exception of large missiles, such as giant-thrown rocks and siege weapons). Creatures that pass through the wall treat it as difficult terrain and must make a DC 10 Strength check. Failure indicates that the creature cannot pass through the wall this round, but may try again in future rounds. Gases, gaseous breath weapons, and creatures in _ [gaseous form](spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)_ cannot pass through the wall.

Fire Wall (Wall)

**School** evocation [[fire](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_fire-subtype)]; **Level** druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_

This effect word creates a vertical wall of crackling flame. Creatures in the space of the wall when it forms or that attempt to pass through the wall take 2d6 points of fire damage + 1 point of fire damage per level of the wordcaster (maximum +20). A Reflex save halves this damage. The wall blocks line of sight.

Ice Wall (Wall)

**School** evocation [[cold](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_cold-subtype)]; **Level** druid 4, magus 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, summoner 4

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_

This effect word creates a vertical wall of solid ice. The wall must be a smooth, uninterrupted surface when formed. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level and has 3 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall blocks line of sight.

Stone Wall (Wall)

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 5, druid 6, magus 5, sorcerer/wizard 5, summoner 5

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_

This effect word creates a vertical wall of solid stone. The wall must be a smooth, uninterrupted surface when formed. The wall is 1 inch thick per caster level, has hardness 8, and has 15 hit points per inch of thickness. The wall blocks line of sight.

Blade Wall (Wall)

**School** conjuration (creation); **Level** cleric 6, summoner 5

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Reflex half; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _barrier_

This effect word creates a vertical wall of whirling blades that deals 1d6 points of damage per level to any creature that comes in contact with it. If a creature is in the area of the wall when it forms, that creature can make a Reflex save to avoid the damage entirely. Creatures that pass through the wall can make a Reflex save to halve the damage. Regardless of the outcome of their roll, they still move through the wall. This wall provides cover to creatures on the other side, but does not block line of sight.
