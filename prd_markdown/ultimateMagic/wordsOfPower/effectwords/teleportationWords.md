**Target Restrictions** _selected_

A wordspell with this effect word teleports willing targets to another plane of existence. The caster must be one of the targets of a wordspell with this effect word.

**School** conjuration (teleportation); **Level** cleric 8, sorcerer/wizard 9

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

A wordspell with this effect word creates a gateway between the wordcaster's current plane and another plane of existence. While this gate is open, creatures, spells, effects, and objects from either plane can freely pass between the planes through the gateway, which takes the form of an archway dividing the emanation in half. The wordcaster cannot control the destination on the other plane and the target will arrive within 5–500 miles of the intended location.
