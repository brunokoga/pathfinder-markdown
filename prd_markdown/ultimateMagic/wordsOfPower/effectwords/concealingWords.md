Words from this family hide creatures and objects from observation and detection.

Unseen Shell (Concealing)

**School** illusion (glamer); **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

When cast, a wordspell with this effect word makes any objects or creatures designated by the caster within the area invisible so long as they remain in the area and do not attack or otherwise take offensive actions. All possessions carried by the creatures remain invisible as long as they remain in the area, so an arrow fired from a bow would become visible when it leaves the area.

**Boost** : The target does not become visible if it attacks or takes an offensive action. Boosting this effect word increases its level by 2.
