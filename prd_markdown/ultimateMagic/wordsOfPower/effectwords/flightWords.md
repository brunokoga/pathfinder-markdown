## Flight Words

These words allow those who know them to soar through the heavensâ€”slowing falls with weaker wordspells, but gaining true flight with the greatest one.

Glide (Flight)

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 1, bard 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, summoner 1, witch 1

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

**Target Restrictions** _selected_

The target of a wordspell with this effect word falls at a rate of 20 feet per round, and for every 5 feet fallen in this way, can move horizontally 20 feet, up to a maximum of 80 feet per round. Regardless of the circumstances, the target can never gain elevation with this effect, and the wordspell with this effect word immediately ends the next time the target lands on a solid surface. If the spell ends while the subject is still gliding, the subject falls as normal.

Float (Flight)

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 2, bard 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, summoner 2, witch 2

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

**Target Restrictions** _selected_

The target of a wordspell with this effect word can float in the air, rising or falling at a rate of 30 feet per round as a move action. This effect only allows for vertical movement, but other forces might allow the target to move horizontally as well. The caster has no control over this movement, but can end a wordspell with this effect word prematurely as an immediate action.

Soar (Flight)

**School** transmutation; **Level** alchemist 3, cleric 4, magus 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3, witch 3

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

**Target Restrictions** _selected_

The target of a wordspell with this effect word gains a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability (40 feet if encumbered or wearing medium or heavy armor). The target also receives an insight bonus on [Fly](skills/fly.md#_fly) skill checks equal to 1/2 the caster's level.
