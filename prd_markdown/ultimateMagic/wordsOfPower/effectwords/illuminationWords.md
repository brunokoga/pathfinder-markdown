## Illumination Words

Illumination words can either create light or siphon it away, instead creating darkness.

Radiance (Illumination)

**School** evocation; **Level** bard 1, cleric 1, druid 1, inquisitor 1, magus 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

The area of a wordspell with this effect word radiates light like a torch for the duration, shedding normal light in the wordspell's area and increasing the light level for an additional 20 feet by one step, up to normal light.

Gloom (Illumination)

**School** evocation; **Level** bard 2, cleric 2, magus 2, sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

The target of a wordspell with this effect word radiates darkness out to a range of 20 feet, negating all natural light sources and all magical light sources of a level lower than the wordspell. It reduces the natural light level by one step. A wordspell with this effect word has no effect on an area that is already dark.

Sunshine (Illumination)

**School** evocation; **Level** bard 3, cleric 3, druid 3, paladin 3, sorcerer/wizard 3

**Duration** 10 minutes/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

**Target Restrictions** _burst_ (emanation)

The target of a wordspell with this effect word radiates shining white light for the duration of the spell, shedding bright light in the wordspell's area and increasing the light level for an additional 30 feet by one step, up to bright light. Creatures that take penalties in bright light take those penalties while in the wordspell's area, but it is not true sunlight and does not damage or destroy creatures vulnerable to real sunlight.
