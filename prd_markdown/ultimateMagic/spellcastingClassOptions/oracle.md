# Oracle

Not all vessels of the divine choose their path. Rather, some find themselves chosen, raised to a life of power and responsibility by forces they themselves may not understand. These are the oracles, agents gifted by providence and serving not a single deity, but rather many sources, venerating and drawing magic from all those patron deities who support their ideals. Whether a curse or a gift, the strange powers and unsettling mysteries of the oracles make them forces to be reckoned with, both in the halls of power and on the fields of battle.

This section introduces new oracle mysteries. Following these mysteries are six new oracle archetypes. Each archetype includes a list of recommended mysteries that are particularly suitable for that archetype, though the archetypes are not limited only to oracles of those mysteries. An archetype's bonus spells replace the normal bonus spells for the oracle's chosen mystery.

# Mysteries

The following are new mysteries for oracles. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the oracle's class level + the oracle's Charisma modifier. Effects that duplicate spells use the oracle's class level as her caster level.

## Ancestor

You gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls, damage rolls, and Will saves against fear for a number of rounds equal to your Charisma bonus.

_Spirit Walk (Su)_: You can become incorporeal and invisible. While in this form, you can move in any direction and pass through solid objects.

You can use this ability once per day at 11th level, and twice per day at 15th level. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

_Storm of Souls (Su)_: You can summon the spirits of your ancestors to attack in a ghostly barrage—their fury creates physical wounds on creatures in the area. The storm has a range of 100 feet and is a 20-foot-radius burst. Objects and creatures in the area take 1d8 hit points of damage for every two oracle levels you possess. Undead creatures in the area take 1d8 points of damage for every oracle level you possess. A successful Fortitude save reduces the damage to half.

_Wisdom of the Ancestors (Su)_: Once per day, you can enter a trance in which you commune with the spirits of your ancestors. This trance lasts for 10 minutes, which must be uninterrupted and during which you can take no other actions. When you come out of this trance, you have gained mystical insight into the future.

At 5th level, the insight takes the form of a _ [divination](spells/divination#_divination)_ with 90% effectiveness. At 8th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a _ [commune](spells/commune#_commune)_ spell. None of these spell effects require material components.

After successfully attacking with this ability, you may use a full-round action to sort through the jumble of stolen thoughts and memories to make a single [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) check using the victim's skill bonus.

_Gift of Madness (Su)_: You tap into the unthinkable void between the stars and cause a single living creature within 30 feet to become confused for 1 round.

You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Interstellar Void (Su)_: You call upon the frigid depths of outer space to bring a terrible chill to your enemies.

At 10th level, the interstellar void is so extreme that a creature that fails its save is fatigued. At 15th level, a creature that fail its save is exhausted and stunned for 1 round.

_Read the Tapestry (Sp)_: Once per day, you can spend 10 minutes meditating on the mysteries of the Dark Tapestry to send your mind to another plane and communicate with the strange or alien beings there.

_Touch of the Void (Su)_: As a standard action, you can perform a melee touch attack that deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess.

_Iron Skin (Sp)_: Once per day, your skin hardens and takes on the appearance of iron, granting you DR 10/adamantine. This ability functions as _ [stoneskin](spells/stoneskin#_stoneskin)_, using your oracle level as the caster level, except it only affects you. At 15th level, you can use this ability twice per day. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

_Iron Weapon (Su)_: You can create a melee simple or martial weapon that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your size and entirely made of metal (even if it would normally include non-metal parts, such as a spear's shaft) but functions as if it were a normal weapon of its type. You are considered proficient with this weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp. At 3rd level, the blade is made of cold iron. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the blade gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 11th level, the blade is made of adamantine. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Riddle of Steel (Su)_: Your sacred bond with metal gives you insight into its form and function.

_Steel Scarf (Su)_: As a swift action, you can harden a scarf, sleeve, cloak, or other piece of your clothing into something as hard as steel that stretches out to be up to 30 feet long. You can then strike outward with it as if it were a weapon making a melee attack. For the purpose of this ability, you are proficient with this weapon. You can use the weapon to perform combat maneuvers. Make a melee attack roll against a creature within 30 feet; you may use [Weapon Finesse](feats#_weapon-finesse) with this attack. If you hit, the weapon deals 1d8 points of slashing damage + 1 point for every two oracle levels you possess. After this attack, the clothing returns to its normal length and hardness. You do not threaten an area with this weapon and cannot use it to make attacks of opportunity. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Vision in Iron (Sp)_: You can use any piece of polished metal at least the size of a dagger as a scrying device, as if using the spell _ [scrying](spells/scrying#_scrying)_. At 15th level, this functions like _ [greater scrying](spells/scrying#_scrying-greater)_. You can scry for a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level; these rounds do not need to be consecutive. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

**Final Revelation** : Upon reaching 20th level, you become a master of iron and steel. You gain the benefits of [Weapon Focus](feats#_weapon-focus), [Greater Weapon Focus](feats#_greater-weapon-focus), and [Improved Critical](feats#_improved-critical) with any one metal weapon that you are proficient with. Your armor is like a second skin to you—while wearing metal armor you are proficient with, the armor's maximum Dexterity bonus increases by +5 and you take no armor check penalty. In addition, any metal you create with your magic (such as _ [wall of iron](spells/wallOfIron#_wall-of-iron)_) has its hardness increased by +10.

_Aging Touch (Su)_: Your touch ages living creatures and objects. As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1 point of Strength damage for every two oracle levels you possess to living creatures. Against objects or constructs, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per oracle level. If used against an object in another creature's possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five oracle levels you possess.

The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this time, as it exists outside of time and space—in effect, the creature ceases to exist for the duration of this ability.

You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level.

You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

_Temporal Celerity (Su)_: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice and take either result.

At 11th level, you can roll for initiative three times and take any one of the results.

_Time Flicker (Su)_: As a standard action, you can flicker in and out of time, gaining concealment (as the _ [blur](spells/blur#_blur)_ spell). You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the _ [blink](spells/blink#_blink)_ spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.

_Time Hop (Su)_: As a move action, you can teleport up to 10 feet per oracle level that you possess per day. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments.

You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.

_Time Sight (Su)_: You can peer through the mists of time to see things as they truly are, as if using the _ [true seeing](spells/trueSeeing#_true-seeing)_ spell. At 15th level, this functions like _ [moment of prescience](spells/momentOfPrescience#_moment-of-prescience)_. At 18th level, this functions like _ [foresight](spells/foresight#_foresight)_. You can use this ability for a number of minutes per day equal to your oracle level, but these minutes do not need to be consecutive. You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.

**Final Revelation** : Upon reaching 20th level, you become a true master of time and stop aging. You cannot be magically aged and no longer take penalties to your ability scores for aging. Age bonuses still accrue, and any aging penalties that you have already accrued remain in place. You cannot die of old age, but you can be killed or die through accident, disease, poison, or other external effects. In addition, you can cast _ [time stop](spells/timeStop#_time-stop)_ once per day as a spell-like ability.

In addition, the sharp splinters count as [caltrops](equipment#_adventuring-gear) in the area until your next turn.

_Tree Form (Sp)_: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Large living or dead tree or shrub, as _ [tree shape](spells/treeShape#_tree-shape)_.

You gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls when wielding a weapon made of or mostly consisting of wood (such as a bow, club, quarterstaff, or spear). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.

_Wood Sight (Su)_: As a move action, you can alter your vision to see through underbrush and plant growth that would normally grant concealment, up to a range of 60 feet (though darkness and other obstacles still may block your sight). At 7th level, you can use this ability to see through wood or other plant material as easily as if it were transparent glass, penetrating a number of feet of wood equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.

_Wooden Weapon (Su)_: You can create a wooden club, quarterstaff, longspear, shortspear, or spear that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess. This weapon is appropriate for your size. You are considered proficient with the weapon. The weapon disappears after 1 round if it leaves your grasp. At 3rd level, the weapon is considered masterwork. At 7th level, 15th level, and 19th level, the weapon gains a +1 enhancement bonus. At 11th level, the weapon gains the _ [keen](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-keen)_ weapon property (or the equivalent increase to its critical threat range, if it is a bludgeoning weapon). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Woodland Stride (Ex)_: You can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.

**Final Revelation** : Upon reaching 20th level, you become a living creature of wood. You are forevermore treated as the plant type rather than your original type for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Your skin takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and you gain a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and damage reduction 10/— against wooden weapons or any natural attacks made by a wooden or woodlike creature. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. At will, you can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as _ [meld into stone](spells/meldIntoStone#_meld-into-stone)_, except wood only, and with no limit to how long you can remain in the wood).

# Dual-Cursed Oracle (Archetype)

All oracles are cursed to some degree, but some oracles bear an even heavier burden. Though doubly afflicted with supernatural or physical hindrances, a dual-cursed oracle can manipulate fortune and gains greater insights into her mystery.

**Recommended Mysteries** : Any.

**Oracle's Curse** : A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level. One of these curses (oracle's choice) never changes its abilities as the oracle gains levels; for example, an oracle with clouded vision never gains darkvision 60 feet, blindsense, or blindsight. The other curse comes with its normal benefits.

**Class Skills** : A dual-cursed oracle gains no additional class skills from her mystery.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [ill omen](advanced/spells/illOmen#_ill-omen)_ (2nd), _ [oracle's burden](advanced/spells/oracleSBurden#_oracle's-burden)_ (4th), _ [bestow curse](spells/bestowCurse#_bestow-curse)_ (6th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

**Revelations** : A dual-cursed oracle gains a new revelation at 5th level and 13th level. These are in addition to the normal revelations she receives at 3rd level, 7th level, and so on. In addition, the cursed oracle may select the following revelations in place of a mystery revelation.

_Misfortune (Ex)_: At 1st level, as an immediate action, you can force a creature within 30 feet to reroll any one d20 roll that it has just made before the results of the roll are revealed. The creature must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. Once a creature has suffered from your misfortune, it cannot be the target of this revelation again for 1 day.

_Fortune (Ex)_: At 5th level, as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed. You must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. You can use this ability once per day at 5th level, and one additional time per day for every six oracle levels beyond 5th.

# Enlightened Philosopher (Archetype)

The enlightened philosopher seeks enlightenment through compassion, moderation, and humility. By following her philosophy's teachings, the enlightened philosopher seeks to reach enlightenment and become one with the universe.

**Alignment** : Any lawful.

**Recommended Mysteries** : ancestor, fire, heavens, lore, metal, nature, stone, time, waves, wood.

**Class Skills** : An enlightened philosopher adds [Linguistics](skills/linguistics#_linguistics) and all [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) skills to her list of class skills. These replace the additional class skills from her mystery.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [owl's wisdom](spells/owlSWisdom#_owl-s-wisdom)_ (4th), _ [water walk](spells/waterWalk#_water-walk)_ (6th), _ [discern lies](spells/discernLies#_discern-lies)_ (8th), _ [true seeing](spells/trueSeeing#_true-seeing)_ (10th), _ [wind walk](spells/windWalk#_wind-walk)_ (12th), _ [ethereal jaunt](spells/etherealJaunt#_ethereal-jaunt)_ (14th), _ [moment of prescience](spells/momentOfPrescience#_moment-of-prescience)_ (16th), _ [astral projection](spells/astralProjection#_astral-projection)_ (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

**Revelations** : An enlightened philosopher must take the following revelation at 7th level.

_Mental Acuity (Ex)_: As the lore mystery revelation.

**Final Revelation** : Upon achieving 20th level, you achieve true enlightenment and become one with the universe. You receive a bonus on all saving throws equal to your Charisma modifier. You become immune to confusion, exhaustion, fatigue, nausea, and sickened effects. You can take 20 on all [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) skill checks. Should you die, you are reborn 3 days later as a living example of the summoning of your chosen philosophy (treat as the _ [reincarnate](spells/reincarnate#_reincarnate)_ spell). This replaces the final revelation of the oracle's mystery.

# Planar Oracle (Archetype)

A planar oracle has an affinity with one of the Outer Planes. She is at home on the multiple planes of the Great Beyond, and can eventually become an outsider herself.

**Recommended Mysteries** : dark tapestry, flame, heavens, stone, waves, wind.

**Bonus Spells** : _ [endure elements](spells/endureElements#_endure-elements)_ (2nd), _ [elemental speech](advanced/spells/elementalSpeech#_elemental-speech)_ (4th), _ [tongues](spells/tongues#_tongues)_ (6th), _ [planar adaptation](advanced/spells/planarAdaptation#_planar-adaptation)_ (8th), _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift#_plane-shift)_ (10th), _ [mass planar adaptation](advanced/spells/planarAdaptation#_planar-adaptation,-mass)_ (12th), _ [shadow walk](spells/shadowWalk#_shadow-walk)_ (14th), _ [etherealness](magicItems/armor#_armor-etherealness)_ (16th), _ [gate](spells/gate#_gate)_ (18th). These bonus spells replace the oracle's mystery bonus spells at these levels.

**Revelations** : At 1st level, you must choose one Outer Plane with which you have an affinity. This choice cannot be changed. A planar oracle must take the following revelation at 3rd level.

_Planar [Resistance](spells/resistance#_resistance) (Su)_: At 3rd level, you gain energy resistance 10 against one energy type associated with your chosen plane. At 11th level, your energy resistance increases to 20.

**Final Revelation** : At 20th level, you become an extraplanar creature. Choose one outer plane, such as Heaven or the Abyss. You gain superficial physical characteristics as appropriate to natives of your chosen outer plane. For example, if your chosen plane is Heaven, you gain angelic features such as a halo and metallic skin. This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to “outsider (extraplanar),” except on your associated plane, where your type is “outsider (native).” In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. This replaces the final revelation of the oracle's mystery.

# Possessed Oracle (Archetype)

Some oracles are possessed by spirits, demons, or similar beings. Instead of the possessed oracle drawing her powers from deities, these otherworldly forces work their magic through her.

# Seer (Archetype)

While all oracles possess some ability at divination, the seer is a true prophet, able to see things as they really are, or will be.

**Recommended Mysteries** : lore, nature, time.

At 5th level, you gain the benefits of a _ [divination](spells/divination#_divination)_ spell with 90% effectiveness. At 9th level, the knowledge you gain is equivalent to a _ [commune](spells/commune#_commune)_ spell. None of these spell effects require material components. You must take this revelation at 3rd level.

# Stargazer (Archetype)

Some oracles seek meaning in the pattern of the stars across the night sky, the trails of comets, and the eternal orbits of the planets.

**Recommended Mysteries** : dark tapestry, heavens, lore, nature, time.

**Class Skills** : A stargazer adds [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (nature), [Perception](skills/perception#_perception), and [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) to her list of class skills. These replace the additional class skills from her mystery.
