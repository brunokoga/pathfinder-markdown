# Sorcerer

Sorcerous power is, by its very nature, a strange and unpredictable thing, the result of mysterious magical heritages and the intermingling of creatures both legendary and mundane. With the magical legacies flowing through their veins, sorcerers can undertake great works capable of placing them forever in the halls of heroes—or laying waste to all around them.

The following section introduces new sorcerer bloodlines, as well as two new sorcerer archetypes—crossblooded and wildblooded—the latter of which comes with its own unique selection of modified bloodlines to reflect its bizarre and mutated origins.

# Bloodlines

## Accursed

Misfortune, pestilence, and nightmares follow your family like vermin drawn to carrion. Somewhere in your family history, a hag's foul influence entered your bloodline. You may actually be related to the hag, or you may still be suffering the effects of a curse that a hag laid upon your kin in generations past. Now the hag's powers are part of your heritage.

**Class Skill** : [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [ray of enfeeblement](spells/rayOfEnfeeblement.md#_ray-of-enfeeblement)_ (3rd), _ [touch of idiocy](spells/touchOfIdiocy.md#_touch-of-idiocy)_ (5th), _ [ray of exhaustion](spells/rayOfExhaustion.md#_ray-of-exhaustion)_ (7th), _ [bestow curse](spells/bestowCurse.md#_bestow-curse)_ (9th), _ [feeblemind](spells/feeblemind.md#_feeblemind)_ (11th), _ [eyebite](spells/eyebite.md#_eyebite)_ (13th), _ [insanity](spells/insanity.md#_insanity)_ (15th), _ [dimensional lock](spells/dimensionalLock.md#_dimensional-lock)_ (17th), _ [energy drain](spells/energyDrain.md#_energy-drain)_ (19th).

**Bonus Feats** : [Alertness](feats.md#_alertness), [Blind-Fight](feats.md#_blind-fight), [Combat Casting](feats.md#_combat-casting), [Deceitful](feats.md#_deceitful), [Defensive Combat Training](feats.md#_defensive-combat-training), [Endurance](feats.md#_endurance), [Great Fortitude](feats.md#_great-fortitude), [Mounted Combat](feats.md#_mounted-combat).

**Bloodline Arcana** : You count as a hag for the purpose of joining a hag's coven. The coven must contain at least one hag. In addition, whenever you are within 30 feet of another sorcerer with this bloodline or a witch with the coven hex, you can use the aid another action to grant a +1 bonus to the other spellcaster's caster level for 1 round.

**Bloodline Powers** : The source of your power isn't pretty, but it does allow you to emulate the preternatural ugliness and toughness of a hag—though doing so won't help you make friends.

_Horrific Visage (Su)_: At 1st level, you can draw upon your hag ancestor to cause one target to perceive you as having a horrifying appearance. As a standard action, you can force one target within 30 feet to make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or be shaken for 1 round for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess (minimum 1 round). This is a mind-affecting, fear-based ability. This fear does not stack with other fear effects. You may use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Wretched [Endurance](feats.md#_endurance) (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain a +2 bonus on all saving throws against charm, cold, fear, fire, and sleep effects. And 9th level, these bonuses increase to +4.

_Dread Gaze (Su)_: At 9th level, you gain a form of the green hag's evil eye power. As a standard action, you may fix your gaze on any one creature within 60 feet. The target must make a Will save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma modifier) or be staggered for 1 round for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess. You may use this ability once per day at 9th level. At 17th level, you can use this ability twice per day. At 20th level, you may use this ability three times per day.

_ [Dream](spells/dream.md#_dream) Walking (Sp)_: At 15th level, you can enter the ethereal plane. This functions like _ [ethereal jaunt](spells/etherealJaunt.md#_ethereal-jaunt)_, but with a duration of 1 minute for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess. Once during this trip, you may cast _ [nightmare](spells/nightmare.md#_nightmare)_ as a spell-like ability on a creature you see on the Material Plane. (This is an exception to the normal rule that ethereal creatures cannot affect targets on the Material Plane).

_Fearsome [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) (Su)_: At 20th level, your hag-blood gives you considerable resilience. You gain DR 10/cold iron, and gain SR equal to 6 + your sorcerer level.

## Djinni

You were born with the power of air genies, and the magic of the djinn is strong in you.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (planes).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to electricity. This also changes the spell's descriptors to match this energy type.

**Bloodline Powers** : Like a djinni, you have both natural power over air and several other genie-based abilities.

_Electricity Ray (Sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of electricity damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Elemental [Resistance](spells/resistance.md#_resistance) (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain electricity resistance 10. Your electricity resistance increases to 20 at 9th level.

_Elemental Movement (Su)_: At 15th level, you gain a fly speed of 60 feet with average maneuverability.

_Power of the Djinn (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the power of genies to grant wishes. Once per day, you can cast _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_ as a spell-like ability. Such wishes must begin with the words “I wish,” and cannot duplicate a wish you have granted within the past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, you must provide that component.

You also become immune to electricity damage, and can use _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ once per day to travel to or from the Plane of Air.

## Efreeti

You were born with the power of fire genies, and the magic of the efreet is strong in you.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (planes).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to fire. This also changes the spell's descriptors to match this energy type.

**Bloodline Powers** : Like an efreeti, you have both natural power over air and several other genie-based abilities.

_Fire Ray (Sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of fire damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Elemental [Resistance](spells/resistance.md#_resistance) (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain fire resistance 10. At 9th level, your fire resistance increases to 20.

_Efreeti Form (Su)_: At 9th level, you gain the ability to assume the form of an efreeti once per day. This acts like the spell _ [giant form I](spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-i)_, except you only use it to become an efreeti and its duration is 1 round per level. While in this form, you also gain an efreeti's heat ability.

_Elemental Movement (Su)_: At 15th level, your base speed increases by +30 feet.

_Power of the Efreet (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the power of genies to grant wishes. Once per day, you can cast _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_ as a spell-like ability. Such wishes must begin with the words “I wish,” and cannot duplicate a wish you have granted within the past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, you must provide that component.

You also become immune to fire damage, and can use _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ once per day to travel to or from the Plane of Fire.

## Maestro

The spiritual power of art and song runs strongly through your family line. This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.

**Class Skill** : [Perform](skills/perform.md#_perform).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [ventriloquism](spells/ventriloquism.md#_ventriloquism)_ (3rd), _ [hideous laughter](spells/hideousLaughter.md#_hideous-laughter)_ (5th), _ [suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ (7th), _ [shout](spells/shout.md#_shout)_ (9th), _ [dominate person](spells/dominatePerson.md#_dominate-person)_ (11th), _ [mass suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion-mass)_ (13th), _ [power word blind](spells/powerWordBlind.md#_power-word-blind)_ (15th), _ [greater shout](spells/shout.md#_shout-greater)_ (17th), _ [wail of the banshee](spells/wailOfTheBanshee.md#_wail-of-the-banshee)_ (19th).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell with a verbal component and no somatic or material component, you treat your caster level as if it were one higher.

**Bloodline Powers** : You hear music whenever you cast spells, and can use the songs in your head to create magic effects.

_Beguiling Voice (Ex)_: At 1st level, you can use the sound of your voice to lull a target creature into taking no action. This ability acts as the _ [daze](spells/daze.md#_daze)_ spell, except it is language-dependent, has a duration of 1 round, and affects a living creature whose Hit Dice do not exceed your sorcerer level. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Fascinate (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain the ability to use a [Perform](skills/perform.md#_perform) skill to cause one or more creatures to become fascinated with you. This acts as the fascinate bardic perform ability, except the save DC is 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma bonus, and it lasts 1 round/level. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level, twice per day at 8th level, three times per day at 13th level, and four times per day at 18th level.

_Perfect Voice (Su)_: At 9th level, you understand all efforts to communicate through sound, and can make yourself understood to any creature able to understand language. You can speak to, and understand the speech of, any creature that understands at least one spoken language. The save DCs of language-dependent spells you cast increase by +1.

_Inspire (Sp)_: At 15th level, your artistic magic can inspire your allies to great accomplishments. You can use _ [greater heroism](spells/heroism.md#_heroism-greater)_ as a spell-like ability. You can use this ability once per day at 15th level, twice per day at 17th level, and three times per day at 19th level.

_Grand Maestro (Su)_: At 20th level, the power of pure magic music flows through you. You cast any spell with a verbal component as if it had the [Still Spell](feats.md#_still-spell) metamagic feat applied to it, with no increase to the casting time or spell slot required to cast it. You gain immunity to sonic damage and language-dependent spells.

## Marid

You were born with the power of water genies, and the magic of the marids is strong in you.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (planes).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [obscuring mist](spells/obscuringMist.md#_obscuring-mist)_ (3rd), _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility)_ (5th), _ [gaseous form](spells/gaseousForm.md#_gaseous-form)_ (7th), _ [wall of ice](spells/wallOfIce.md#_wall-of-ice)_ (9th), _ [persistent image](spells/persistentImage.md#_persistent-image)_ (11th), _ [elemental body III](spells/elementalBody.md#_elemental-body-iii)_ (13th), _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ (15th), _ [polar ray](spells/polarRay.md#_polar-ray)_ (17th), _ [wish](spells/wish.md#_wish)_ (19th).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to cold. This also changes the spell's descriptors to match this energy type.

**Bloodline Powers** : Like a marid, you have both natural power over water and several other genie-based abilities.

_ [Frost](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-frost) Ray (Sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of cold damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Elemental [Resistance](spells/resistance.md#_resistance) (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain cold resistance 10. At 9th level, your cold resistance increases to 20.

_Water's Fury (Su)_: At 9th level, you gain the ability to summon a rushing jet of water from the elemental plane of water and direct it against your foes. As a standard action, you can create a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage per two sorcerer levels you possess, and blinds the target that was struck for 1d6 rounds. A Reflex save (DC 10 + 1/2 your sorcerer level + your Charisma bonus) reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect.

_Elemental Movement (Su)_: At 15th level, you gain a swim speed of 60 feet.

_Power of the Marid (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the power of genies to grant wishes. Once per day, you can cast _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_ as a spell-like ability. Such wishes must begin with the words “I wish,” and cannot duplicate a wish you have granted within the past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, you must provide that component.

You become immune to cold damage, and can use _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ once per day to travel to or from the Plane of Water.

## Rakshasa

At some point in your family's history, one of your ancestors was tainted by the influence of a rakshasa. Though most of your family seem entirely normal, you have always felt your own skin is a prison from which magic allows you to escape. Your birthright is a secret you may be forced to keep from societies that would never deal with you if your heritage were known.

**Class Skill** : [Disguise](skills/disguise.md#_disguise).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [charm person](spells/charmPerson.md#_charm-person)_ (3rd), _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_ (5th), _ [suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ (7th), _ [detect scrying](spells/detectScrying.md#_detect-scrying)_ (9th), _ [prying eyes](spells/pryingEyes.md#_prying-eyes)_ (11th), _ [mass suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion-mass)_ (13th), _ [greater polymorph](spells/polymorph.md#_polymorph-greater)_ (15th), _ [mind blank](spells/mindBlank.md#_mind-blank)_ (17th), _ [dominate monster](spells/dominateMonster.md#_dominate-monster)_ (19th).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Add half your sorcerer level to the [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.md#_spellcraft) DC for others to identify spells you cast. If their checks fail by 5 or more, they mistakenly believe you are casting an entirely different spell (selected by you when you begin casting).

**Bloodline Powers** : You can call upon the nearly divine power of your rakshasa ancestors, giving you the power to convincingly deceive your enemies.

_Silver Tongue (Su)_: At 1st level, you can draw upon your outsider heritage to spin amazingly convincing lies. Activating this ability is a swift action. You gain a +5 bonus on one [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff) check made to convince another of the truth of your words (similar to using _ [glibness](spells/glibness.md#_glibness)_). If a magical effect is used against you that would detect your lies or force you to speak the truth, the user of the effect must succeed on a caster level check (DC 10 + your sorcerer level) to succeed. Failure means the effect does not detect your lies or force you to speak only the truth. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Mind Reader (Sp)_: At 3rd level, you can read minds as a spell-like ability. This ability acts like _ [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts.md#_detect-thoughts)_, except it lasts only 1 round, you use it on a single target as a standard action, and if the target fails its Will save, you gain information as if you had concentrated on it for 3 rounds. You may use this ability once per day at 3rd level and one additional time per day for every four sorcerer levels you possess beyond 3rd, up to five times per day at 20th level.

_Hide Aura (Sp)_: At 9th level, you can conceal yourself from prying magic. This ability acts like a constant _ [nondetection](spells/nondetection.md#_nondetection)_ spell cast upon yourself. You can end or restore this protection as a move action.

_Alter Self (Sp)_: At 15th level, you can change your shape into that of any humanoid at will. This ability acts like _ [alter self](spells/alterSelf.md#_alter-self)_, except you may remain in a chosen form as long as you want.

_Outsider (Su)_: At 20th level, your natural form becomes an animal-headed humanoid, like a true rakshasa. This does not affect your ability to speak or cast spells. You can use your _ [alter self](spells/alterSelf.md#_alter-self)_ or other disguise and polymorph abilities to assume your original form or other forms when it suits you. You are forevermore treated as a native outsider rather than as a humanoid (or whatever your original type was) for the purpose of spells and other magical effects. Unlike other outsiders, you can still be brought back from the dead as if you were a member of your previous creature type. You gain DR 10/piercing.

## Shaitan

You were born with the power of earth genies, and the magic of the shaitans is strong in you.

**Class Skill** : [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (planes).

**Bonus Spells** : _ [true strike](spells/trueStrike.md#_true-strike)_ (3rd), _ [glitterdust](spells/glitterdust.md#_glitterdust)_ (5th), _ [greater magic weapon](spells/magicWeapon.md#_magic-weapon-greater)_ (7th), _ [stoneskin](spells/stoneskin.md#_stoneskin)_ (9th), _ [wall of stone](spells/wallOfStone.md#_wall-of-stone)_ (11th), _ [wall of iron](spells/wallOfIron.md#_wall-of-iron)_ (13th), _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ (15th), _ [iron body](spells/ironBody.md#_iron-body)_ (17th), _ [wish](spells/wish.md#_wish)_ (19th).

**Bonus Feats** : [Dodge](feats.md#_dodge), [Empower Spell](feats.md#_empower-spell), [Great Fortitude](feats.md#_great-fortitude), [Improved Initiative](feats.md#_improved-initiative), [Lightning Reflexes](feats.md#_lightning-reflexes), [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack), [Skill Focus](feats.md#_skill-focus) ( [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) [planes]), [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse).

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you cast a spell that deals energy damage, you can change the type of damage to acid. This effect also changes the spell's descriptors to match this energy type.

**Bloodline Powers** : Like a shaitan, you have both natural power over earth, and several other genie-based abilities.

_Acid Ray (Sp)_: Starting at 1st level, you can unleash an elemental ray as a standard action, targeting any foe within 30 feet as a ranged touch attack. This ray deals 1d6 points of acid damage + 1 for every two sorcerer levels you possess. You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.

_Elemental [Resistance](spells/resistance.md#_resistance) (Ex)_: At 3rd level, you gain acid resistance 10. At 9th level, your acid resistance increases to 20.

_Avalanche (Su)_: At 9th level, whenever you hit a single target with a spell that deals damage, you may make a bull rush check as a swift action. Your CMB for this maneuver is equal to your sorcerer caster level + your Charisma bonus. You can make this maneuver even if the target is not in melee range, and you do not provoke an attack of opportunity for making this maneuver. If the target is in contact with earth, stone, or rock, you gain a +4 bonus on your CMB check.

_Elemental Movement (Su)_: At 15th level, you gain a burrow speed of 30 feet.

_Power of the Shaitan (Su)_: At 20th level, you gain the power of genies to grant wishes. Once per day, you can cast _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_ as a spell-like ability. Such wishes must begin with the words “I wish,” and cannot duplicate a wish you have granted within the past 24 hours. If you use this ability to duplicate a spell with a costly material component, you must provide that component.

You become immune to acid damage, and can use _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_ once per day to travel to or from the Plane of Earth.

# Crossblooded (Archetype)

A crossblooded bloodline combines the powers of two distinct heritages. In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from the conjunction of other powers. A draconic sorcerer who is also the culmination of a great destiny, an abyssal sorcerer from a family that dealt with devils, and an arcane sorcerer raised from birth by fey are all possible sources for crossblooded bloodlines.

A crossblooded sorcerer selects two different bloodlines. The sorcerer may gain access to the skills, feats, and some of the powers of both bloodlines she is descended from, but at the cost of reduced mental clarity and choice (see Drawbacks).

**Class Skill** : A crossblooded sorcerer receives the bonus class skill from both of her bloodlines. If these are the same skill, this does not grant any additional benefit.

**Bonus Spells** : A crossblooded sorcerer may select her bonus spells from either of her bloodlines. The sorcerer also has the choice to learn a lower-level bonus spell she did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell she would normally gain. Lower-level bonus spells learned this way always use the spell level that they would be if the sorcerer had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.

_Example_: A 3rd-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded sorcerer has the choice of learning _ [cause fear](spells/causeFear.md#_cause-fear)_ or _ [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson.md#_enlarge-person)_ as her bloodline bonus spell. If she selected _ [cause fear](spells/causeFear.md#_cause-fear)_ as her 3rd-level bonus spell, at 5th level she could use her new bonus spell to learn _ [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson.md#_enlarge-person)_ instead of _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_ or _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility)_, and she would add it to her list of 1st-level spells known (just as if she had learned it as her 3rd-level bonus spell).

**Bonus Feat** : A crossblooded sorcerer combines the bonus feat lists from both of her bloodlines and may select her bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.

**Bloodline Arcana** : A crossblooded sorcerer gains the bloodline arcana of both her bloodlines.

**Bloodline Powers** : At 1st, 3rd, 9th, 15th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded sorcerer gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to her at that level. She may instead select a lower-level bloodline power she did not choose in place of one of these higher-level powers.

**Drawbacks** : A crossblooded sorcerer has one fewer spell known at each level (including cantrips) than is presented on the [sorcerer spells known table](classes/sorcerer.md#_table-3-15-sorcerer-spells-known). Furthermore, the conflicting urges created by the divergent nature of the crossblooded sorcerer's dual heritage forces her to constantly take some mental effort just to remain focused on her current situation and needs. This leaves her with less mental resolve to deal with external threats. A crossblooded sorcerer always takes a –2 penalty on Will saves.

# Wildblooded (Archetype)

A wildblooded sorcerer has a mutated version of a more common bloodline, with one arcana and at least one bloodline power that are different from those of an unmutated bloodline. When creating a wildblooded sorcerer, select an existing bloodline, then select one of the following mutated bloodlines associated with that bloodline. Use the normal bloodline's class skill, bonus spells, and bonus feats, and the mutated bloodline's bloodline arcana. Use the normal bloodline's bloodline powers, except when the mutated bloodline replaces one of those powers.

## Anarchic

Your magical power taps into pure anarchy.

**Associated Bloodline** : Protean.

**Bloodline Arcana** : Whenever you fail a concentration check to cast a spell, a cantrip effect is created. Randomly determine one of your cantrips known (for example, if you know 6 cantrips, roll 1d6). There is a 50% chance this cantrip affects a target of your choice within 60 feet; otherwise it affects you.

**Bloodline Powers** : Raw magical energy lashes out when you destroy or negate hostile spells.

_Wild Feedback (Su)_: At 3rd level, when you successfully dispel or counterspell an opponent's spell, the caster (if it is within 100 feet) takes 1d6 points of damage +1 per level of the spell affected. This bloodline power replaces protean resistances.

## Arial
