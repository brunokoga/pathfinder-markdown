You wrest the control of a construct from its master. For as long as you concentrate, you can control the construct as if you were its master. You must make a [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.md#_spellcraft) check each round to maintain control. The DC of the [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.md#_spellcraft) check is (10 + the construct's HD). If the construct's creator or master is present and trying to control the construct, you both must make opposed Spellcraft checks each round to control the construct.
