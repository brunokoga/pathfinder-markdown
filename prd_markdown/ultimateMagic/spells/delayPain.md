**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Duration** 1 hour/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You override the target's ability to feel pain. Pain effects (such as _ [pain strike](advanced/spells/painStrike.md#_pain-strike)_\*\* and _ [symbol of pain](spells/symbolOfPain.md#_symbol-of-pain)_) do not affect the target until this spell's duration has expired. This does not negate any physical damage, ability damage, or ability drain that a pain effect has already done, but it does negate ongoing penalties from pain while the spell lasts.
