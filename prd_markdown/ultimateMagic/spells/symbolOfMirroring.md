This spell functions as _ [symbol of death](spells/symbolOfDeath#_symbol-of-death)_, except it instead creates one illusory duplicate of each creature within 60 feet of the symbol. These duplicates function as _ [mirror image](spells/mirrorImage#_mirror-image)_, moving with the original creatures and mimicking their movements, sounds, and actions exactly. If an illusory double is destroyed, a new one appears on the creature's turn. The images last for as long as a creature remains within 60 feet of the symbol, and for 1 round/level thereafter. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Symbol of mirroring_ can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](spells/permanency#_permanency)_ spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 5,000 gp.
