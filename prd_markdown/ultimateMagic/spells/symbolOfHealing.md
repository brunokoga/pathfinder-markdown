Symbol of Healing

**School** conjuration (healing); **Level** cleric 3, paladin 4, witch 4

**Components** V, S, M (mercury and phosphorous, plus powdered diamond and opal worth a total of 500 gp)

**Saving Throw** Will half (harmless) (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless) (see text)

This spell functions as _ [symbol of death](spells/symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, except all creatures within 60 feet of the _symbol of healing_ instead are bathed in positive energy and heal 2d8 points + 1 point of damage per caster level (maximum +15). Undead and other creatures harmed by positive energy instead take 2d8 points of damage + 1 point per caster level (maximum +15); a Will save reduces this damage by half. A creature can only be healed or harmed by the symbol once in any 24-hour period. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Symbol of healing_ can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](spells/permanency.md#_permanency)_ spell by a caster of 10th level or higher for the cost of 10,000 gp.
