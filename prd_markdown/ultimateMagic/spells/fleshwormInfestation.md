Fleshworm Infestation

**School** conjuration (summoning) [evil]; **Level** cleric 4, inquisitor 4, sorcerer/wizard 4, witch 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** touch

**Target** creature touched

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Fortitude partial (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

With a touch, you cause an infestation of ravenous worms to manifest in the target's flesh. The target must make a Fortitude save every round. Failure means it takes 1d6 hit points of damage and 2 points of Dexterity damage, and is staggered for 1 round. If it makes the save, it takes no hit point or Dexterity damage and is only sickened for 1 round rather than staggered. _Fleshworm infestation_ cannot be ended early by _ [remove disease](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/removeDisease.html#_remove-disease)_ or _ [heal](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/heal.html#_heal)_, as the infestation starts anew if the current worms are slain. _ [Protection from evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/protectionFromEvil.html#_protection-from-evil)_ negates this spell's effects for as long as the two durations overlap. _ [Dispel evil](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dispelEvil.html#_dispel-evil)_ automatically ends a _fleshworm infestation_.
