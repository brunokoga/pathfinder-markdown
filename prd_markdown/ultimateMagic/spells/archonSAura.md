**Range** 20 ft.

**Area** 20-ft. radius centered on you

You gain a powerful aura, similar to an archon's aura of menace. Any hostile creature within a 20-foot radius of you must make a Will save to resist the effects of this aura. If the creature fails, it takes a â€“2 penalty on attack rolls and saving throws and to Armor Class for the duration of this spell, or until it successfully hits you with an attack. A creature that has resisted or broken the effect cannot be affected again by this particular casting of _archon's aura_.
