This spell functions as _ [symbol of death](spells/symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_, except all creatures within the radius of a _symbol of strife_ are compelled to attack the nearest conscious creature for 1 round per caster level (similar to the “attack nearest creature” result of the _ [confusion](spells/confusion.md#_confusion)_ spell), even after leaving the symbol's area of effect. If no other creatures are visible, an affected creature can act normally. Once triggered, the symbol remains active for 10 minutes per caster level.

_Symbol of strife_ can be made permanent with a _ [permanency](spells/permanency.md#_permanency)_ spell by a caster of 18th level or higher for the cost of 25,000 gp.
