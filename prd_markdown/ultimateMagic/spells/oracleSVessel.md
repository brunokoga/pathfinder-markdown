Oracle's Vessel

**School** transmutation; **Level** oracle 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

The target gains all the benefits of your oracle's curse, with none of the penalties. In some cases, this has no effect (for example, a fighter with your haunted curse can't cast spells and doesn't gain any benefit from having additional spells known).
