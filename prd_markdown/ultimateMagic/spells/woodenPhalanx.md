You create 1d4+2 [wood golems](/pathfinderRPG/prd/../monsters/golem.html#_golem-wood) with the [advanced template](/pathfinderRPG/prd/../monsters/monsterAdvancement.html#_advanced-creature). The golems willingly aid you in combat or battle, perform a specific mission, or serve as bodyguards. You can only have one _wooden phalanx_ spell in effect at one time. If you cast this spell while another casting is still in effect, the previous casting is dispelled.
