**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

You cause a single opponent to become profoundly stricken with intense grief. He can take no actions, takes a â€“2 penalty to Armor Class, and loses his Dexterity bonus (if any). He can attempt a new save each round to break the spell's effect.
