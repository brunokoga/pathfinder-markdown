Delusional Pride

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 1, sorcerer/wizard 1, witch 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 minute

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

The target becomes so distracted by an overblown sense of its worth that it takes a â€“2 penalty on attacks and skill checks. However, this feeling also gives the target a +2 morale bonus on saves against charm and compulsion effects.
