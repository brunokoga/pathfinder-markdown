Envious Urge

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 4, sorcerer/wizard 6

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Targets** one creature/level, no two of which can be more than 30 ft. apart

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You fill creatures with feelings of seething envy. Affected targets turn upon the nearest creature (whether an ally or enemy) and attempt to disarm it of a valuable weapon, steal something it is holding, or grapple it and strip it of something it prizes (your choice). Affected targets can attempt a new Will save each round as a free action to end this effect.
