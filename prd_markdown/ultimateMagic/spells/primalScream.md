**School** abjuration [mind-affecting, sonic]; **Level** bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You voice a mighty yell from the depths of your soul, invigorating yourself and dispelling enchantment and paralysis effects. This functions as _ [break enchantment](spells/breakEnchantment.md#_break-enchantment)_, except it only affects you and only frees you from enchantment and paralysis effects. If the caster level check to break the hostile effect succeeds, you give voice to your scream and the spell takes effect normally; if not, this spell fails without further effect. You can cast this spell even when paralyzed or unable to speak because of an enchantment effect, but not in an area of silence , if you are unable to speak for reasons other than enchantments or paralysis (for example, if you are gagged), or if cast in an environment where speaking is not possible.
