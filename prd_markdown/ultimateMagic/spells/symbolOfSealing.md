This spell allows you to scribe a potent rune of power upon   
or above a door or other opening measuring no more than   
20 square feet/level in size. When the casting is completed, the symbol immediately triggers, glowing visibly and sealing the door or opening with an invisible barrier of force equivalent to a _ [wall of force](spells/wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force)_. Destroying the symbol ends the effect, though destroying it once the symbol has been activated requires destroying the _ [wall of force](spells/wallOfForce.md#_wall-of-force)_ first. Once triggered, the wall remains for 10 minutes per caster level.

When scribing a _symbol of sealing_, you can specify a password or phrase that allows a creature speaking it to bypass the seal and pass through the opening. You can also attune any number of creatures to the _symbol of sealing_, but doing this extends the casting time as described under _ [symbol of death](spells/symbolOfDeath.md#_symbol-of-death)_. However, the force wall created by the symbol blocks attacks and line of effect even for creatures that know the password or are attunedâ€”the password only prevents them from triggering the symbol, not from ignoring its effects if triggered.

A _ [disintegrate](spells/disintegrate.md#_disintegrate)_ spell or similar effect can destroy the wall of force created by the symbol if the caster makes a caster level check against a DC of 11 + your caster level. A _ [knock](spells/knock.md#_knock)_ spell has no effect on a _symbol of sealing_ or its force wall. A _symbol of sealing_ cannot be dispelled, but _ [mage's disjunction](spells/mageSDisjunction.md#_mage-s-disjunction)_ automatically destroys it.
