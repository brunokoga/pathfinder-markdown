The target gains the ability to breathe water and a swim speed of 30 feet. This swim speed means the target also gains the standard +8 bonus on [Swim](skills/swim#_swim) checks and the ability to take 10 on [Swim](skills/swim#_swim) checks even while distracted or endangered. The target can use the run action while swimming, provided it swims in a straight line. The spell does not make the target unable to breathe air.
