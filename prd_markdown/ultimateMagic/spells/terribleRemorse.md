Terrible Remorse

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [emotion, mind-affecting]; **Level** bard 3, cleric 4, inquisitor 3, sorcerer/wizard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** 1 living creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will partial (see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

You fill a target with such profound remorse that it begins to harm itself. Each round, the target must save or deal 1d8 points of damage + its Strength modifier to itself using an item held in its hand or with unarmed attacks. If the creature saves, it is staggered for 1 round and takes a -2 penalty to Armor Class, after which the spell ends.
