Dance of a Hundred Cuts

**School** transmutation; **Level** bard 4

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 round/level

You become a lethal combat dancer, swirling and spinning with grace and precision. You gain a morale bonus on melee attack rolls, melee damage rolls, and [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks, and to Armor Class. This bonus is equal to +1 per 3 caster levels (maximum +5 at 15th level). The bonus to AC is lost under any circumstances that would cause you to lose your Dexterity bonus to AC. You must remain moving for the spell to stay in effect. If in any round you do not either move at least 10 feet or make a melee attack, the spell's duration ends.
