You generate an arc of lightning between two targets. The lightning deals 1d6 points of electricity damage per caster level (maximum 15d6) to both targets and any creatures in a line connecting them. The spell fails if there is no line of effect between the targets. _Lightning arc_ sets fire to combustibles and damages objects in its path. It can melt metals that have a low melting point, such as lead, gold, copper, silver, or bronze.
