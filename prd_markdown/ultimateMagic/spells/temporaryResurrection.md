**School** necromancy; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

**Casting Time** 10 minutes

**Components** V, S, M (diamond dust worth 500 gp)

**Range** touch

**Target** dead creature touched

**Duration** 24 hours

You restore temporary life to a body that has been dead for less than 48 hours. The spell lasts for 24 hours, after which the target dies again. The target gains 1 permanent negative level while under the effect of this spell; this negative level goes away when the target dies or is permanently raised from the dead (such as with _ [raise dead](spells/raiseDead.md#_raise-dead)_). The target still counts as a dead corpse (but not undead) for the purpose of spells that revive dead creatures, so a cleric can cast _ [raise dead](spells/raiseDead.md#_raise-dead)_ or a similar spell on the target even while this spell is active. Once a creature has been revived with _temporary resurrection_, this spell cannot be used on it again until it is permanently raised from the dead.
