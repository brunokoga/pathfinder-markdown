Ki Leech

**School** necromancy [evil]; **Level** cleric 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** personal

**Target** you

**Duration** 1 minute/level (D)

You place your spirit in a receptive state so when you confirm a critical hit against a living enemy or reduce a living enemy to 0 or fewer hit points, you can steal some of that creature's _ki_. This replenishes 1 point of _ki_ as long as you have at least 1 _ki_ point in your _ki_ pool. This does not allow you to exceed your _ki_ pool's maximum. This ability does not stack with similar abilities (such as the steal _ki_ ability of the [hungry ghost monk](advanced/coreClasses/monk.md#_hungry-ghost-monk)).

This spell has no effect if you do not have a [_ki_](../advanced/coreClasses/monk.md#_ki-pool) pool.
