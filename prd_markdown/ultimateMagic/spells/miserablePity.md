This spell functions as _ [sanctuary](spells/sanctuary.md#_sanctuary)_, except creatures attempting to attack the target who fail their saves also feel a strong sense of pity toward the target, as if it were weak, pathetic, and not a threat. If the target breaks the spell by attacking, any creature that failed its save against the spell gains a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target for 1 minute.
