Circle of Clarity

**School** abjuration; **Level** cleric 7, sorcerer/wizard 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, F (a crystal lens worth 100 gp)

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** 20-ft.-radius emanation centered on a creature, object or point in space

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** Will negates (harmless); **Spell Resistance** yes (harmless)

You create a magical emanation that interferes with all figments and glamers within it, giving creatures a +4 bonus on saving throws to recognize them as illusions. The emanation negates concealment less than total concealment within the area. [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks to notice creatures or objects within the area gain a bonus equal to half your caster level (maximum +10). The spell is stationary if cast on a point in space. It is mobile if centered on a creature or object, though creatures or attended objects can negate the spell with a saving throw or spell resistance.
