Prediction of Failure

**School** divination [curse, fear, mind-affecting]; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 8, witch 8

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** permanent or 1 round/level (see text)

**Saving Throw** Will partial; **Spell Resistance** yes

You wrack the target's body and mind with the anguish and suffering of every bitter failure it will ever experience, rendering it permanently shaken and sickened. A successful Will save reduces the duration to 1 round per level. If the target is a spellcaster, failing this saving throw means it also gains a [random minor spellblight](../magic/spellblights#_random-minor-spellblight-table).
