Forbid Action

**School** enchantment (compulsion) [language-dependent, mind-affecting]; **Level** cleric 1, inquisitor 1

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component** V

**Range** close (25 ft. +5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You forbid the target a single course of action, which it avoids to the best of its ability. You may demand the target not take actions that fall into one of the following options.

_Attack_: The target cannot take any action that involves an attack roll, or uses a spell or ability that targets a foe or an area that includes a foe.

_Cast_: Target cannot cast spells or use spell-like abilities.

_Communicate_: The target cannot take any actions that allow it to communicate with anyone. This includes such acts as speaking, [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) checks to pass secret messages, writing, and using telepathy. It does not prevent verbalizations made for purposes other than communication, such as command words or the verbal component of spellcasting.

_Draw_: Target cannot ready or prepare any item, weapon, component, or equipment.

_Move_: The target can take no act that would cause it to end up in a different location. The target does not resist being moved by others (and thus can be picked up or dragged, or can float along on a raft), but does not consciously attempt to move (including not directing a mount to move).

The target is free to take any actions not forbidden by the caster. For example, a target affected by this spell's demand to not move is still free to cast spells, make attacks, or shout for help.
