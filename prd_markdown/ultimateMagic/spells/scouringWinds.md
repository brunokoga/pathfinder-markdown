Scouring Winds

**School** evocation [air, earth]; **Level** druid 7, sorcerer/wizard 7, witch 7

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S

**Range** medium (100 ft. + 10 ft./level)

**Effect** sandstorm in 20-ft. radius, 20 ft. high

**Duration** 1 round/level (D)

**Saving Throw** none; **Spell Resistance** yes (see text)

This spell brings forth a windstorm of stinging sand that blocks all vision. You can move the storm up to 30 feet each round as a move action.

Any creature in the area takes 3d6 points of piercing damage each round. The area is considered a windstorm (see the [wind effects table](../environment#_table-13-10-wind-effects)).

If a creature with spell resistance successfully resists this spell, it is unaffected by the winds and sand, but still unable to see within the area of the spell.
