You instill the target animal with the combat training general purpose (see the [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) skill). This supersedes the animal's previous trained purpose and any tricks it knows. When the spell ends, it reverts to its previous trained purpose and known tricks.
