You create a masterwork dagger out of ice. The dagger deals 1 point of cold damage in addition to normal dagger damage. If the dagger leaves your hand for more than 1 round, it melts and the spell ends. At 6th level, the dagger functions as a   
_+1 [frost](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-frost) dagger_. At 11th level, it gains the _ [returning](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-returning)_ property when thrown, melting away and reforming in your hand just before your next turn.
