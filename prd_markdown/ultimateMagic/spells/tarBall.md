You create a sticky ball of burning tar that you can hurl at your enemies as a ranged attack. If the tar ball strikes, it deals 1d4 points of fire damage + your Strength modifier, and splashes the target with hot, sticky tar. The tar deals 1d4 points of fire damage each round on the creature's turn for the next 1d4 rounds and gives the target a â€“2 penalty to Dexterity for that duration. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to attempt to extinguish or cool the tar before taking this additional damage. Extinguishing or cooling the tar requires a DC 15 Reflex save or at least 1 gallon of nonflammable liquid. Rolling on the ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or magically cooling the target automatically ends the effect.
