# Weapons

Without a doubt, weapons number among adventurers' most coveted possessions. Whether weapons are used as tools to lay foul monsters low, as the medium for magical enhancements, or as outlets for a host of fundamental class abilities, few heroes head into the field without their favorite—or perhaps even a whole arsenal of their favorites. This section presents all manner of nonmagical weapons for PCs to purchase and put to use, whatever their adventures might entail. The weapons presented here should be relatively easy to find and purchase in most towns and cities, although GMs might wish to restrict the availability of some of the more expensive and exotic items.

All weapons deal hit point damage. This damage is subtracted from the current hit points of any creature struck by the weapon. When the result of the die roll to make an attack is a natural 20 (that is, the die actually shows a 20), this is known as a critical threat (although some weapons can score a critical threat on a roll of less than 20). If a critical threat is scored, another attack roll is made, using the same modifiers as the original attack roll. If this second attack roll exceeds the target's AC, the hit becomes a critical hit, dealing additional damage.

Weapons are grouped into several interlocking sets of categories. These categories pertain to what training is needed to become proficient in a weapon's use (simple, martial, or exotic), the weapon's usefulness either in close combat (melee) or at a distance (ranged, which includes both thrown and projectile weapons), its relative encumbrance (light, one-handed, or two-handed), and its size (Small, Medium, or Large).

**Simple, Martial, and Exotic Weapons** : Most character classes are proficient with all simple weapons. Combat-oriented classes such as barbarians, cavaliers, and fighters are proficient with all simple and all martial weapons. Characters of other classes are proficient with an assortment of simple weapons and possibly some martial or even exotic weapons. All characters are proficient with unarmed strikes and any natural weapons they gain from their race. A character who uses a weapon with which he is not proficient takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls with that weapon.

**Melee and Ranged Weapons** : Melee weapons are used for making melee attacks, though some can be thrown as well. Ranged weapons include thrown weapons or projectile weapons that are not effective in melee.

> _Reach Weapons:_ Glaives, guisarmes, lances, longspears, ranseurs, and whips are examples of reach weapons. A reach weapon is a melee weapon that allows its wielder to strike at targets that aren't adjacent to him. Most reach weapons double the wielder's natural reach, meaning that a typical Small or Medium wielder of such a weapon can attack a creature 10 feet away, but not a creature in an adjacent square. A typical Large character wielding a reach weapon of the appropriate size can attack a creature 15 or 20 feet away, but not adjacent creatures or creatures up to 10 feet away.
> 
> _Double Weapons:_ Dire flails, gnome hooked hammers, and two-bladed swords are examples of double weapons. A character can fight with both ends of a double weapon as if fighting with two weapons, but she incurs all the normal attack penalties associated with two-weapon combat, just as though the character were wielding a one-handed weapon and a light weapon.

The character can also choose to use a double weapon two-handed, attacking with only one end of it. A creature wielding a double weapon in one hand can't use it as a double weapon—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.

> _Thrown Weapons:_ Daggers, darts, javelins, throwing axes, light hammers, and nets are examples of thrown weapons. The wielder applies his Strength modifier to damage dealt by thrown weapons (except for splash weapons).

It is possible to throw a weapon that isn't designed to be thrown (that is, a melee weapon that doesn't have a numeric entry in the Range column on the following weapon tables), and a character who does so takes a –4 penalty on the attack roll. Throwing a light or one-handed weapon is a standard action, while throwing a two-handed weapon is a full-round action. Regardless of the type of weapon, such an attack scores a threat only on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. Such a weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

> _Projectile Weapons:_ Blowguns, crossbows, shortbows, slings, longbows, and halfling sling staves are examples of projectile weapons—weapons that launch ammunition at a target. Most projectile weapons require two hands to use (see specific weapon descriptions). A character cannot apply his Strength modifier on damage rolls with a projectile weapon unless it's a sling or a specially built composite shortbow or composite longbow. If the character has a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when she uses a bow or a sling.
> 
> _Ammunition:_ Projectile weapons use ammunition, such as arrows for bows, bolts for crossbows, darts for blowguns, or sling bullets for slings and halfling sling staves. When using a bow, a character can draw ammunition as a free action; crossbows and slings require an action for reloading (as noted in their descriptions). Generally speaking, ammunition that hits its target is destroyed or rendered useless, while ammunition that misses has a 50% chance of being destroyed or lost.

Although shuriken are thrown weapons, they are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.

**Light, One-Handed, and Two-Handed Melee Weapons** : This designation is a measure of how much effort it takes to wield a weapon in combat. It indicates whether a melee weapon, when wielded by a character of the weapon's size category, is considered a light weapon, a one-handed weapon, or a two-handed weapon.

> _Light:_ A light weapon is used in one hand. It is easier to use in one's off hand than a one-handed weapon is, and can be used while grappling. Add the wielder's Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a light weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or half the wielder's Strength modifier if it's used in the off hand. Using two hands to wield a light weapon gives no advantage on damage; the Strength modifier applies as though the weapon were held in the wielder's primary hand only.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon.

> _One-Handed:_ A one-handed weapon can be used in either the primary hand or the off hand. Add the wielder's Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with a one-handed weapon if it's used in the primary hand, or half his Strength modifier if it's used in the off hand. If a one-handed weapon is wielded with two hands during melee combat, add 1-1/2 times the character's Strength modifier to damage rolls made with that weapon.
> 
> _Two-Handed:_ Two hands are required to use a two-handed melee weapon effectively. Apply 1-1/2 times the character's Strength modifier to damage rolls for melee attacks with such a weapon.

**Weapon Size** : Every weapon has a size category. This designation indicates the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. A weapon's size category isn't the same as its size as an object. In general, a light weapon is an object two size categories smaller than the wielder, a one-handed weapon is an object one size category smaller than the wielder, and a two-handed weapon is an object of the same size category as the wielder.

> _Inappropriately Sized Weapons_: A creature can't make optimum use of a weapon that isn't properly sized for it. A cumulative –2 penalty applies on attack rolls for each size category of difference between the size of its intended wielder and the size of its actual wielder. If the creature isn't proficient with the weapon, a –4 nonproficiency penalty also applies.

The measure of how much effort it takes to use a weapon (whether the weapon is designated as a light, one-handed, or two-handed weapon for a particular wielder) is altered by one step for each size category of difference between the wielder's size and the size of the creature for which the weapon was designed. For example, a Small creature wields a Medium one-handed weapon as a two-handed weapon (it still takes the –2 penalty for using an inappropriately sized weapon). If a weapon's designation would be changed to something other than light, one-handed, or two-handed by this alteration, the creature can't wield the weapon at all.

**Improvised Weapons** : Sometimes objects not crafted to be weapons nonetheless see use in combat—commonly bottles, chair legs, stray femurs, and that sort of thing. Because such objects are not designed for this use, any creature that uses an improvised weapon in combat is considered to be nonproficient with it and takes a –4 penalty on attack rolls made with that object. To determine the size category and appropriate damage for an improvised weapon, compare its relative size and damage potential to the weapon list to find a reasonable match. An improvised weapon scores a critical threat on a natural roll of 20 and deals double damage on a critical hit. An improvised thrown weapon has a range increment of 10 feet.

## Weapon Qualities

**Price** : This value is the weapon's price in gold pieces (gp) or silver pieces (sp). The price includes miscellaneous gear that goes with the weapon, such as a scabbard or quiver.

This price is the same for a Small or Medium version of the weapon. A Large version costs twice the listed price.

**Dmg** : These columns give the damage dealt by the weapon on a successful hit. The column labeled "Dmg (S)" is for Small weapons. The column labeled "Dmg (M)" is for Medium weapons. If two damage ranges are given in the same column, then the weapon is a double weapon. Use the second damage figure given for the double weapon's extra attack. Table 1–8: Tiny and Large Weapon Damage gives weapon damage values for Tiny and Large weapons.

**Critical** : The entry in this column notes how the weapon is used with the rules for critical hits. When your character scores a critical hit, roll the damage two, three, or four times, as indicated by its critical multiplier (using all applicable modifiers on each roll), and add all the results together.

Extra damage over and above a weapon's normal damage (such as sneak attack damage or bonus damage from the flaming weapon quality) is not multiplied when you score a critical hit.

> _×2_: The weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons deal triple or quadruple damage.
> 
> _×2/×3_: One head of this double weapon deals double damage on a critical hit. The other head deals triple damage. Some double weapons' heads deal triple and quadruple damage on a critical hit.
> 
> _19–20/×2_: The weapon scores a threat on a natural roll of 19 or 20 (instead of just 20) and deals double damage on a critical hit. Some weapons score a threat on a natural 18 as well, or deal triple instead of double damage on a critical hit.

**Range** : Any attack at more than this distance is penalized for range. Beyond this range, the attack takes a cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment (or fraction thereof) of distance to the target. For example, a dagger (with a range of 10 feet) thrown at a target that is 25 feet away would incur a –4 penalty. A thrown weapon has a maximum range of five range increments. A projectile weapon can shoot up to 10 range increments.

**Weight** : This column gives the weight of a Medium version of the weapon. Halve this number for Small weapons; double it for Large weapons. Some weapons have a special weight. See the weapon's description for details.

**Type** : Weapons are classified according to the type of damage they deal: B for bludgeoning, P for piercing, or S for slashing. Some monsters may be resistant or immune to attacks from certain types of weapons.

Some weapons deal damage of multiple types. If a weapon causes two types of damage, the type it deals is not half one type and half another; rather, all damage caused is considered to be of both types. Therefore, a creature would have to be immune to both types of damage to ignore any of the damage caused by such a weapon.

In other cases, a weapon can deal either of two types of damage. In a situation where the damage type is significant, the wielder can choose which type of damage to deal with such a weapon. For example, the damage caused by a dagger depends on whether the wielder is thrusting to deal piercing damage or slicing to deal slashing damage.

**Special** : Some weapons have special features in addition to those noted in their descriptions.

> _Blocking:_ When you use this weapon to fight defensively, you gain a +1 shield bonus to AC.
> 
> _Brace:_ If you use a readied action to set a brace weapon against a charge, you deal double damage on a successful hit against a charging creature.
> 
> _Deadly:_ When you use this weapon to deliver a coup de grace, it gains a +4 bonus to damage when calculating the DC of the Fortitude saving throw to see whether the target of the coup de grace dies from the attack. The bonus is not added to the actual damage of the coup de grace attack.
> 
> _Disarm:_ When you use this weapon, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm an enemy.
> 
> _Distracting:_ You gain a +2 bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff) skill checks to feint in combat while wielding this weapon.
> 
> _Double:_ You can use a double weapon to fight as if fighting with two weapons, but if you do, you incur all the normal attack penalties associated with fighting with two weapons, just as if you were using a one-handed weapon and a light weapon. You can choose to wield one end of a double weapon two-handed, but it cannot be used as a double weapon when wielded in this way—only one end of the weapon can be used in any given round.
> 
> _Fragile:_ Fragile weapons cannot take the beating that sturdier weapons can. A fragile weapon gains the broken condition if the wielder rolls a natural 1 on an attack roll with the weapon. If a fragile weapon is already broken, the roll of a natural 1 destroys it instead. Masterwork and magical fragile weapons lack these flaws unless otherwise noted in the item description.

If a weapon gains the broken condition in this way, that weapon is considered to have taken damage equal to half its hit points +1. This damage is repaired either by something that addresses the effect that granted the weapon the broken condition (like quick clear in the case of firearm misfires or the [Field Repair](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_field-repair) feat) or by the repair methods described in the broken condition. When an effect that grants the broken condition is removed, the weapon regains the hit points it lost when the broken condition was applied. Damage done by an attack against a weapon (such as from a sunder combat maneuver) cannot be repaired by an effect that removes the broken condition.

> _Grapple:_ On a successful critical hit with a weapon of this type, you can attempt a combat maneuver check to grapple your opponent as a free action. This grapple attempt does not provoke an attack of opportunity from the creature you are attempting to grapple if that creature is not threatening you. While you grapple the creature using a grappling weapon, you can only move or damage the creature on your turn. You are still considered grappled, though you do not have to be adjacent to the creature to continue the grapple. If you move far enough away that the creature you're grappling is no longer within the weapon's reach, you end the grapple with that action.
> 
> _Monk:_ A monk weapon can be used by a monk to perform a flurry of blows.
> 
> _Nonlethal:_ These weapons deal nonlethal damage.
> 
> _Performance:_ When wielding this weapon, if an attack or combat maneuver made with this weapon prompts a performance combat check, you gain a +2 bonus on that check.
> 
> _Reach:_ You can use a reach weapon to strike opponents 10 feet away, but you can't use it against an adjacent foe.
> 
> _Trip:_ When you use a trip weapon to make a trip attack, if you are tripped during your own trip attempt, you can drop the weapon to avoid being tripped.
## Masterwork Weapons

A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

Without using magic, you can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) skill). The masterwork transformation spell transforms a non-masterwork weapon into a masterwork weapon.

The masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon (or 6 gp to the cost of a single unit of ammunition). Adding the masterwork quality to a double weapon costs twice the normal increase (+600 gp).

Masterwork ammunition is damaged (and effectively destroyed) when used. The enhancement bonus of masterwork ammunition does not stack with any enhancement bonus of the projectile weapon firing it.

All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.

Even though some types of armor and shields can be used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and shields have lessened armor check penalties.

# Weapon Descriptions

Weapons in this section are listed alphabetically by their full names. A few weapons had their names altered to be consistent with how other weapons are named; for example: "flail" and "heavy flail," are now called "light flail" and "heavy flail."

Aklys

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** exotic

The aklys is a hooked throwing club with a 20-foot-long cord, usually of woven leather; you can retrieve the aklys after throwing it as a move action. The hook allows you to make trip attacks at range. Some aklyses have holes drilled through them and whistle when flung.

Amentum

**Price** —

**Type** martial

An amentum is a long leather thong that attaches to a standard javelin. Before throwing, the amentum is wound about the javelin's shaft. You then throw the javelin while gripping the amentum, imparting spin on the weapon and greatly improving its range. Attaching an amentum to a javelin is a move action, and winding it is a full-round action. Javelins can be stored with amenta already wound about them. A javelin wound with an amentum is considered a martial weapon.

Arrows

**Price** 1 gp (20)

**Type** ammunition

An arrow used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Arrows come in a leather quiver that holds 20 arrows.

Atlatl

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** martial

This Stone Age weapon is a thin piece of wood or antler used as a lever to hurl a specially fitted dart. An atlatl gives much greater range to a dart, but must be loaded like a projectile weapon. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use an atlatl, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire—but not load—an atlatl with one hand. Loading an atlatl is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity. The [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload) feat can be taken for atlatls, allowing you to load a dart as a free action.

Atlatl Dart

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** ammunition

An atlatl dart is the equivalent of a javelin except it has fletching. If thrown without an atlatl, treat it as a javelin.

Bamboo Shaft Arrow

**Price** 1 gp (10)

**Type** ammunition

These foot-long arrows are used as ammunition for arrow tubes. As an improvised melee weapon, they deal damage equivalent to that of a spiked gauntlet. They come in a bamboo tube that holds 10 shafts.

Bardiche

**Price** 13 gp

**Type** martial

The crescent axe-blade of this polearm is attached to the haft at two points: the center of the blade attaches to a socket at the top of the haft, and the lower point of the blade attaches to a secondary mount point. The blade is often very long, sometimes almost as long as the haft. You gain a +2 bonus to your CMD to resist sunder attempts made against a bardiche.

Bastard Sword

**Price** 35 gp

**Type** exotic

A bastard sword is about 4 feet in length, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. You can use a bastard sword two-handed as a martial weapon.

Battle Aspergillum

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** simple

Named for the common aspergillum, a macelike tool used by priests to sprinkle holy water, this light mace has a hollow head and a metal plug closing off the hole through which the head is filled. When the mace strikes a creature, holy water sprinkles out through tiny holes throughout the weapon's head; creatures subject to damage from holy water take 1 point of damage in addition to the normal effect of being struck by the mace (a nonmagical aspergillum can deal holy water damage to an incorporeal creature in this manner, even if the mace itself deals no damage). After 5 hits, the battle aspergillum is empty and needs to be refilled. Filling it with holy water is a standard action that provokes attacks of opportunity (like drinking a potion). A filled aspergillum is normally carried upright, to prevent the holy water from leaking out as the weapon moves.

battleaxe

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** martial

The handle of this axe is long enough that you can wield it one-handed or two-handed. The head may have one blade or two, with blade shapes ranging from half-moons to squared edges like narrower versions of woodcutting axes. The wooden haft may be protected and strengthened with metal bands called langets.

Bayonet

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** simple

Bayonets are close combat weapons designed to fit into the grooves or muzzles of crossbows and firearms. They allow you to make melee attacks with these weapons but render them temporarily useless as ranged weapons. Attaching or removing a bayonet is a move action.

Bec de Corbin

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** martial

The bec de corbin is a polearm very similar to the lucerne hammer, but the hammer head is slightly blunter and the spike is stouter and more hooked. You primarily attack with the spike. You gain a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder medium or heavy armor with a bec de corbin.

bill

**Price** 11 gp

**Type** martial

The blade of this polearm is a curved or hooked chopping blade with a spiked projection on the back of the blade. The spike is commonly used to block and parry. When fighting defensively or with full defense, this weapon gives you a +1 shield bonus to AC. A mounted opponent hit by a bill takes a –1 penalty on his [Ride](skills/ride.md#_ride) check to stay mounted.

blowgun

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** simple

Blowguns are generally used to deliver debilitating (but rarely fatal) poisons from a distance. They are nearly silent when fired. For a list of appropriate poisons, see Poisons on page 110.

Blowgun Darts

**Price** 5 sp (10)

**Type** ammunition

The thin, light darts used in a blowgun are usually made of hardwood with a stabilizing fletching of down or fur. A dart is usually loaded from the back end just before firing.

Blunt Arrows

**Price** 2 gp (20)

**Type** ammunition

These arrows have rounded wooden tips that deal bludgeoning damage rather than piercing. An archer can use a blunt arrow to deal nonlethal damage (at the normal –4 attack penalty for using a lethal weapon to deal nonlethal damage).

bo staff

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** exotic

Similar to a quarterstaff, only more slender and tapered at one end, the bo staff is both a defensive device and a weapon.

boar spear

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** simple

This spear has a metal crossbar to protect you against onrushing attackers. If you ready a boar spear against a charge and your attack hits, you gain a +2 shield bonus to your AC against that creature until your next turn.

bolas

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** exotic

A bolas is a pair of wooden, stone, or metal weights connected by a thin rope or cord. You can whirl and throw this weapon to make a ranged trip attack against an opponent. You can't be tripped during your own trip attempt when using a bolas.

Boomerang

**Price** 3 gp

**Type** exotic

The boomerang is primarily a hunting tool, but it is not uncommon for these versatile thrown weapons to be carried into battle. A boomerang is made of wood and is flat, with a long haft, a pronounced forward curve, and a sharp backward bend at the head. A hunting boomerang does not fly in a returning path.

Brass Knuckles

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** simple

These weapons fit snugly around the knuckles and allow you to deal lethal damage with an unarmed strike. You may hold, but not wield, a weapon or other object in a hand wearing brass knuckles. You may cast a spell with a somatic component while wearing brass knuckles if you make a successful concentration check (DC 10 + the level of the spell you're casting). Monks are proficient with brass knuckles. Brass knuckles can't be disarmed.

butterfly sword

**Price** 20 GP (2)

**Type** martial

These short matching swords come in pairs, cleverly nested together to appear as a single blade. Both weapons can be drawn at the same time, and they can be separated as a free action and wielded in both hands to make wickedly effective chops and slashes. Their thin, broad blades extend just 1 foot in length. A butterfly sword has a hardwood grip covered with braided cord, and a metal D-shaped guard to protect the wielder's hand. The listed price is for a pair of butterfly swords. Masterwork butterfly swords cost 320 gp for the pair. If you add magical enhancement bonuses or properties to a butterfly sword, treat each sword in the pair as a separate weapon (for example, adding a +1 magical enhancement bonus to a pair of masterwork butterfly swords costs 4,000 gp).

cestus

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** simple

The cestus is a glove of leather or thick cloth that covers the wielder from mid-finger to mid-forearm. The close combat weapon is reinforced with metal plates over the fingers and often lined with wicked spikes along the backs of the hands and wrists. While wearing a cestus, you are considered armed and your unarmed attacks deal lethal damage. If you are proficient with a cestus, you can have your unarmed strikes deal bludgeoning or piercing damage. Monks are proficient with the cestus. When using a cestus, your fingers are mostly exposed, allowing you to wield or carry items in that hand, but the constriction of the weapon at your knuckles gives you a –2 penalty on all precision-based tasks involving that hand (such as opening locks). A cestus can't be disarmed.

Chain Spear

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** exotic

This vicious weapon is often used in gladiatorial events due to its versatility. The body of the weapon is a standard short spear, primarily used for thrusting. The butt of the spear is fitted with a length of chain, often spiked, with a hook at the end. The hook and chain may be used to make trip attacks. If your trip attack fails by 10 or more, you may drop the chain spear to avoid being knocked prone.

Chakram

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** martial

The chakram is a simple, elegant, and highly portable thrown weapon. It is a flat, open-centered metal discus with a sharpened edge. You can wield the chakram as a melee weapon, but it is not designed for such use; you take a –1 penalty on your attack roll with the weapon and must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex save or cut yourself on the blade (half damage, no Strength modifier). You do not need to make this save if wearing heavy armor.

Club

**Price** —

**Type** simple

This weapon is usually just a shaped piece of wood, sometimes with a few nails or studs embedded in it.

Composite Longbow

**Price** 100 gp

**Type** martial

You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite longbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use it with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is less than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite longbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite longbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 100 gp to its cost. If you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite longbow. A composite longbow fires arrows.

For the purposes of Weapon Proficiency and similar feats, a composite longbow is treated as if it were a longbow.

Composite shortbow

**Price** 75 gp

**Type** martial

You need at least two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a composite shortbow while mounted. All composite bows are made with a particular strength rating (that is, each requires a minimum Strength modifier to use with proficiency). If your Strength modifier is lower than the strength rating of the composite bow, you can't effectively use it, so you take a –2 penalty on attacks with it. The default composite shortbow requires a Strength modifier of +0 or higher to use with proficiency. A composite shortbow can be made with a high strength rating to take advantage of an above-average Strength score; this feature allows you to add your Strength modifier on damage rolls, up to the maximum bonus indicated for the bow. Each point of Strength bonus granted by the bow adds 75 gp to its cost. you have a negative modifier due to low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow. A composite shortbow fires arrows.

For the purposes of Weapon Proficiency, [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus), and similar feats, a composite shortbow is treated as if it were a shortbow.

Crossbow Bolts

**Price** 1 GP (10)

**Type** ammunition

A crossbow bolt used as a melee weapon is treated as a light improvised weapon (–4 penalty on attack rolls) and deals damage as a dagger of its size (critical multiplier ×2). Bolts come in a case or quiver that holds 10 bolts. All crossbows except repeating crossbows use these kinds of crossbow bolts, which are sometimes called "quarrels."

dagger

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** simple

A dagger is a fighting knife. Its blade is usually less than 1 foot long, and can be curved or straight, with one edge or two. Dagger designs vary widely, and can have many different names (such as a thrusting dagger being called a "dirk"). You get a +2 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) skill checks made to conceal a dagger on your body.

dan Bong

**Price** 1 sp

**Type** exotic

These short, blunt sticks are held in the hands to enhance unarmed martial techniques and secured by a cord looped over the thumb. They provide the wielder with the ability to lock an opponent and target pressure points, granting you a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to grapple.

Dart

**Price** 5 sp

**Type** simple

This thrown weapon is larger than an arrow and shorter than a javelin, with a weighted tip and a shorter range than a javelin. Most darts are wooden shafts with a thick metal point.

Dire flail

**Price** 90 gp

**Type** exotic

A dire flail consists of two spheres of spiked iron dangling from chains at opposite ends of a long haft. This weapon excels at short but powerful strikes, and is typically swung in a constant churning motion. The wielder of a dire flail must have great strength, both to use the weapon effectively and to keep from tiring out.

Dogslicer

**Price** 8 gp

**Type** martial

This short, curved blade was created by goblins, who often drill numerous holes into it in an attempt to reduce its weight. Most dogslicers are sized for Small creatures.

Double Chicken Saber

**Price** 12 gp

**Type** martial

The tip of this 3-foot-long, straight-bladed sword is bent into two staggered, opposing sharpened spurs that can be used to pull weapons from an opponent's hands.

Double Crossbow

**Price** 300 gp

**Type** exotic

This heavy weapon fires a pair of iron-tipped bolts with a single squeeze of the trigger. Because of its size and weight, you take a –4 penalty on your attack roll if you're proficient with it, or –8 if you're not. If the attack hits, the target takes damage from both bolts. Critical hits, sneak attack damage, and other precision-based damage apply to only the first bolt. Reloading one bolt is a standard action; the [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload) feat reduces this to a move action. [Crossbow Mastery](advanced/advancedFeats.md#_crossbow-mastery) allows you to reload both bolts as a move action. A double crossbow fires crossbow bolts.

double walking stick katana

**Price** 50 gp

**Type** exotic

This single case conceals a pair of matched fighting swords perfectly balanced to be wielded as a pair. Despite their name, the blades more closely resemble the shorter wakizashi. When the blades are concealed in their case, this weapon can be used as a quarterstaff.

double-chained kama

**Price** 8 gp

**Type** exotic

This weapon comprises a pair of kama connected with an 8-foot length of chain. The wielder can attack as if armed with a single kama in each hand or extend the chain to make a single reach attack. By swinging the chain, the wielder can whip the kama about to disarm or trip opponents. Furthermore, if one of the weapons is dropped, the wielder can retrieve it as a free action by pulling on the chain.

Dwarven Urgrosh

**Price** 50 gp

**Type** exotic

A dwarven urgrosh is a double weapon—an axe head and a spear point on opposite ends of a long haft. The urgrosh's axe head is a slashing weapon that deals 1d8 points of damage. Its spear head is a piercing weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage. You can use either head as the primary weapon; the other becomes the off-hand weapon. If you use an urgrosh against a charging character, the spear head is the part of the weapon that deals damage. Dwarves treat dwarven urgroshes as martial weapons.

Dwarven waraxe

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** exotic

A dwarven waraxe has a large, ornate head mounted on a thick handle, making it too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. A Medium character can use a dwarven waraxe two-handed as a martial weapon, or a Large creature can use it one-handed in the same way. A dwarf treats a dwarven waraxe as a martial weapon even when using it in one hand.

Earth Breaker

**Price** 40 gp

**Type** martial

The crude metal of this massive hammer's head ends in multiple blunt spikes that help concentrate the force of a powerful swing down into a smaller, more focused area, allowing it to smash through armor with greater ease. Due to the tremendous size and weight of its head, an earth breaker is poorly balanced, and requires two hands to properly lift and control.

Elven Curve Blade

**Price** 80 gp

**Type** exotic

Essentially a longer version of a scimitar, but with a thinner blade, the elven curve blade is exceptionally rare. You receive a +2 circumstance bonus to your CMD whenever a foe attempts to sunder your elven curve blade because of its flexible metal.

You can use the [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse) feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier on attack rolls with an elven curve blade that is sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

Emei Piercer

**Price** 3 gp

**Type** exotic

This weapon is used to augment unarmed martial techniques. It consists of an 8- to 10-inch-long, dual-pointed steel spike set on swivels and mounted on a ring, so that it can be spun around at high speeds when slipped over the wielder's ring finger. The ring prevents the wielder from being disarmed and turns unarmed strikes into piercing attacks.

Falcata

**Price** 18 gp

**Type** exotic

This heavy blade has a single sharp edge, concave at the bottom and convex at the top, with a hook-shaped hilt. Its shape distributes the weight to give it the momentum of an axe with the cutting edge of a sword, much like a larger version of a kukri. The hooked hilt is sometimes carved to resemble the head of a horse or bird of prey, and may have a thin chain stretched across its opening, acting as a partial guard for the hand and fingers.

falchion

**Price** 75 gp

**Type** martial

**Type** exotic

Made to resemble a courtier's fan, this device consists of silk paper stretched and folded over a folding frame of hardened steel.

flight arrows

flying blade

**Price** 40 gp

**Type** exotic

A flying blade is a large, crescent-shaped blade anchored to a 10-foot chain. You fight with a flying blade by spinning it about your head or by snapping it toward an opponent. Because the flying blade is a clumsy weapon, you receive a –2 penalty on attack rolls with it, but when you make attacks of opportunity provoked by movement, you receive a +2 bonus on attack rolls instead of the penalty.

gauntlet

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** simple

This metal glove lets you deal lethal damage rather than nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes. A strike with a gauntlet is otherwise considered an unarmed attack. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. Medium and heavy armors (except breastplates) come with gauntlets. Your opponent cannot use a disarm action to disarm you of gauntlets.

gladius

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** martial

The hammer's blunt head is a bludgeoning weapon that deals 1d6 points of damage (critical multiplier ×3). Its hook is a piercing weapon that deals 1d4 points of damage (critical multiplier ×4). You can use either head as the primary weapon. Gnomes treat hooked hammers as martial weapons.

Great Terbutje

**Price** 12 gp

**Type** exotic

This Stone Age weapon is a 4-foot-long version of the terbutje. It is too large to use in one hand without special training; thus, it is an exotic weapon. You can use a great terbutje two-handed as a martial weapon.

greataxe

**Price** 20 gp

**Type** martial

This two-handed battle axe is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. The head may have one blade or two, and may be "bearded" (meaning hooked or trailing at the bottom) to increase cleaving power and help pull down enemy shields. The haft is usually 3 to 4 feet long.

greatclub

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** martial

This larger, bulkier version of the common club is heavy enough that you can't wield it with one hand. It may be ornate and carved, reinforced with metal, or a simple branch from a tree. Like simple clubs, greatclubs have many names, such as cudgels, bludgeons, shillelaghs, and more.

**Price** 20 gp

**Type** exotic

Made from a specially designed sling attached to a short club, a halfling sling staff can be used by a proficient wielder to devastating effect. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a halfling sling staff, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a halfling sling staff with one hand. Loading a halfling sling staff is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

A halfling sling staff fires bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a halfling sling staff, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.

A halfling sling staff can be used as a simple weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size. Halflings treat halfling sling staves as martial weapons.

Hand Crossbow

**Type** exotic

A harpoon is a barbed spear with an attached rope 50 feet or less in length. Most harpoons have metal points, but some use ivory or are made entirely of wood.

The weight can be reduced by using shorter or lighter rope. If you are not proficient with a harpoon, treat it like a spear.

heavy Crossbow

**Price** 50 gp

**Type** simple

You draw a heavy crossbow back by turning a small winch. Loading a heavy crossbow is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. A heavy crossbow fires crossbow bolts.

Normally, operating a heavy crossbow requires two hands. However, you can shoot, but not load, a heavy crossbow with one hand at a –4 penalty on attack rolls.

Iron Brush

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** martial

This is an iron-handled version of a scholar's brush with a sharpened handle. Though it does little damage, it is easily concealed (you gain a +2 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks made to conceal an iron brush on your body) and can be thrown short distances, or used to jab at key nerve clusters and acupuncture points to surprisingly devastating effect.

Katana

**Price** 50 gp

**Type** exotic

Specifically constructed for samurai, katanas employ multiple types of steel combined in a distinctive forging process. The result are swords noted for their wickedly sharp yet slender, gently curved blades, designed to make graceful hacking strokes capable of severing opponents' heads and limbs. Though finely balanced, these blades are difficult to master. Characters can use a katana two-handed as a martial weapon, but must take the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats.md#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) (katana) feat to use it one-handed.

kerambit

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** martial

This small, curved pull dagger has a metal loop at the base of its handle, allowing it to be secured with a pinky or worn on a string tied in the hair. While relatively small, the curved blade can create brutal wounds.

Its curved shape allows the wielder to hook around defenses and trip foes. The elegant shape of a khopesh leads some artisans to cover them in ornate decorations.

Klar

**Price** 12 gp

**Type** martial

The traditional form of this tribal weapon is a short metal blade bound to the skull of a large horned lizard, but a skilled smith can craft one entirely out of metal.

The lasso has 2 hit points and AC 10, and requires a DC 23 Strength check to break it.

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** exotic

This polearm consists of two curved metal bands that close around a target when you attack, allowing you to bind an opponent.

You may use this weapon in two different ways: In meteor mode you use it as a double weapon, while in fortress mode you cannot use it as a double weapon but gain reach and a +1 shield bonus to AC. Switching between these two modes is a free action decided at the start of your turn.

Monk's Spade

**Price** 20 gp

An entangled creature takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls and a –4 penalty to Dexterity, can move at only half speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by succeeding at an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must succeed at a concentration check with a DC of 15 + the spell's level or be unable to cast the spell.

An entangled creature can escape with a successful DC 20 [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) check (a full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a successful DC 25 Strength check (also a full-round action). A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you.

A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll.

orc double axe

**Price** 60 gp

**Type** exotic

A cruel weapon with blades placed at opposite ends of a long haft, an orc double axe is a double weapon. Though invented by and traditionally associated with orcs, the double axe can be crafted and wielded by other races as well, though many disdain it for its extreme weight and clumsiness. Because of the blades at either end of the axe, the wielder must hold an orc double axe in the middle of its haft, and utilize a weaving, slashing fighting style more akin to that of a quarterstaff than to that of a greataxe or battleaxe.

pata

**Price** 14 gp

**Type** exotic

Once expended, the tube must be repacked before it can be used again. Repacking a tube requires a full-round action, or a standard action if you have the [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload) feat.

Repeating light crossbow

**Price** 250 gp

A sai is a metal spike flanked by a pair of prongs used to trap an enemy's weapon. When wielding a sai, you get a +2 bonus on combat maneuver checks to sunder an enemy's weapon. Though pointed, a sai is not usually used for stabbing. Instead, it is used primarily to bludgeon foes, punching with the hilt, or else to catch and disarm weapons between its tines. Sais are often wielded in pairs.

Sansetsukon

**Price** 8 gp

**Type** martial

Also called a three-section staff, this weapon is divided into three 2-foot-long segments chained together, allowing the wielder greater flexibility than a normal staff and allowing the weapon to be swung rapidly to create a defensive block, wrap and catch weapons, or harness momentum via a whipping motion for powerful strikes.

sap

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** martial

This weapon consists of a soft wrapping around a hard, dense core, typically a leather sheath around a lead rod. The head is wider than the handle and designed to spread out the force of the blow, making it less likely to draw blood or break bones.

Sawtooth sabre

**Price** 35 gp

**Type** exotic

The signature weapon of certain assassin cults, the sawtooth sabre is a cruelly efficient weapon. You may use a sawtooth sabre as a Martial Weapon (in which case it functions identically to a longsword). If you have the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats.md#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) (sawtooth sabre) feat, for the purpose of two-weapon fighting you can treat it as a light melee weapon; for all other purposes it is one-handed melee weapon.

Scimitar

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** martial

This curved sword is shorter than a longsword and longer than a shortsword. Only the outer edge is sharp, and the back is flat, giving the blade a triangular cross-section.

Scizore

**Price** 20 gp

**Type** martial

The scizore is a hardened tube that fits over the forearm, ending in a semicircular blade used for devastating bladed punch attacks. The scizore grants a +1 shield bonus to AC, but if you attack with the blade, you lose the AC bonus that round and take a –1 penalty on attack rolls with it. While wearing a scizore, you cannot use that hand for anything else. A scizore provides a +10 bonus to your CMD against being disarmed of your scizore. Donning a scizore is a full-round action.

Scorpion Whip

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** exotic

This whip has a series of razor-sharp blades and fangs inset along its tip. It deals lethal damage, even to creatures with armor bonuses. If you are proficient with whips, you can use a scorpion whip as a whip.

Scythe

**Price** 18 gp

**Type** martial

This weapon consists of a long wooden shaft with protruding handles and a sharp curved blade set at a right angle. Derived from a farm tool used to mow down crops, a scythe requires two hands to use, and is unwieldy but capable of inflicting grievous wounds. Its connotations as a symbol of death due to its association with reaping also make the scythe a particularly intimidating weapon.

Seven-Branched Sword

**Price** 50 gp

**Type** exotic

This unusual sword has a straight 2-foot-long blade with six shorter L-shaped blades protruding from it, three on each side in a staggered pattern. The shorter blades can be used to snag opponents' clothing or armor, or can target weapons in order to disarm them. To snag armor or clothing, the attacker makes a trip attempt. If successful, the victim doesn't fall prone, but instead is snagged and stumbles forward, leaving the victim flat-footed for the remainder of the round.

Shang Gou

**Price** 6 gp

**Type** martial

Forged in pairs, these solid metal blades end in curved hooks, while the hand guards are hammered into outward-facing spiked crescents. Both the crescent and the tip of the hilt are sharpened for combat. They can be wielded as single weapons or with two-weapon fighting styles. These weapons gain the disarm special feature when they are used individually. A pair of shang gou can also be formed into a single one-handed weapon to gain the trip special feature.

Shortbow

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** martial

A shortbow is made up of one piece of wood about 3 feet in length. You need two hands to use a bow, regardless of its size. You can use a shortbow while mounted. If you have a penalty for low Strength, apply it to damage rolls when you use a shortbow. If you have a bonus for high Strength, you can apply it to damage rolls when you use a composite shortbow, but not a regular shortbow. A shortbow fires arrows.

Shortspear

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** simple

A shortspear is about 3 feet in length, making it a suitable thrown weapon.

shortsword

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** martial

Short swords are some of the most common weapons found in any martial society, and thus designs are extremely varied, depending on the region and creator. Most are around 2 feet in length. Their blades can be curved or straight, single- or double-edged, and wide or narrow. Hilts may be ornate or simple, with crossguards, basket hilts, or no guard at all. Such weapons are often used on their own, but can also be paired as a matched set, or used in conjunction with a dagger or longer sword.

Shotel

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** exotic

The shotel is a downward-curving sword designed to reach over or around an opponent's shield. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a shotel against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields. The curve of a shotel's blade varies from sword to sword, and some models are double-edged, while others are single-edged, with the back edge able to be braced against a shield for additional power. Shotels are particularly useful for hooking mounted combatants and ripping them from their steeds.

Shuriken

**Price** 1 GP (5)

**Type** exotic

A shuriken is a small piece of metal with sharpened edges, designed for throwing. A shuriken can't be used as a melee weapon. Although they are thrown weapons, shuriken are treated as ammunition for the purposes of drawing them and crafting masterwork or otherwise special versions of them, and of what happens to them after they are thrown.

Siangham

**Price** 3 gp

**Type** exotic

This weapon is a handheld shaft fitted with a pointed tip for stabbing foes. It resembles a (much sturdier) arrow with a grip designed for melee combat.

Sibat

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** martial

This weapon is similar to a shortspear with a flexible rattan or bamboo shaft and an elaborately barbed head. The barbs can snag flesh, clothing, or armor to ensnare an enemy.

Sica

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** exotic

This blade is a smaller, lighter version of the shotel. You gain a +1 bonus on attack rolls with a sica against opponents using bucklers, light shields, or heavy shields.

sickle

**Price** 6 gp

**Type** simple

Originating as a farming tool used for reaping grain, this one-handed weapon has a blade with a strong curve that can easily catch an opponent's limb or armor. Its blade can be either smooth or serrated, and some fighting sickles are sharpened on both sides near the point, making it easier to hook into an opponent's flesh.

sling

**Price** —

**Type** simple

A sling is little more than a leather cup attached to a pair of strings. Your Strength modifier applies to damage rolls when you use a sling, just as it does for thrown weapons. You can fire, but not load, a sling with one hand. Loading a sling is a move action that requires two hands and provokes attacks of opportunity.

A sling fires sling bullets. You can hurl ordinary stones with a sling, but stones are not as dense or as round as bullets. Thus, such an attack deals damage as if the weapon were designed for a creature one size category smaller than you and you take a –1 penalty on attack rolls.

Sling Bullets

**Price** 1 sp (10)

**Type** ammunition

Sling bullets are shaped metal balls, designed to be used by a sling or halfling sling staff. Bullets come in a leather pouch that holds 10 bullets.

Smoke Arrow

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** ammunition

This arrow is actually a specially-shaped smokestick that can be fired from a bow. It trails smoke as it flies, and creates a 5-foot cube of smoke where it strikes. It otherwise functions like a normal arrow in terms of damage, range, and so on.

Snag Net

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** exotic

This short, wide net is covered in barbed loops and slipknots. It works like a typical net, except it has the trip weapon special feature. If you entangle an opponent and hold the trailing rope, on your turn in place of a melee attack you may make a combat maneuver check to trip against that opponent; if you succeed, you may trip your opponent or deal 1 point of piercing damage to it. The concentration DC to cast while entangled in a snag net is 17 + the spell's level. The [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) DC to escape a snag net is 22.

Spear

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** simple

A spear is 5 feet in length and can be thrown.

Spiked Armor

**Price** +50 gp

**Type** martial

You can outfit your armor with spikes, which can deal damage in a grapple or as a separate attack. See the armor spikes entry on page 10 for details. Armor spikes can't be disarmed.

Spiked Chain

**Price** 25 gp

**Type** exotic

A spiked chain is about 4 feet in length and covered in wicked barbs. Some have metal hoops to use as handgrips. You can use the [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse) feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a spiked chain sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon.

Spiked Gauntlet

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** simple

This is a gauntlet of thick leather or metal with blades or spikes protruding from above the knuckles, allowing the wearer to stab with the force of a punch. The cost and weight given are for a single gauntlet. An attack with a spiked gauntlet is considered an armed attack. Your opponent cannot disarm you of spiked gauntlets.

Spiked Heavy Shield

**Price** 57 GP/70 gp

**Type** martial

Spiked shields are intimidating weapons, and can have a single protruding central spike, razored shield edges, or a whole forest of deadly protrusions. You can bash with a spiked heavy shield instead of using it for defense. A spiked heavy shield can't be disarmed. See the armor spikes entry on page 10 for details.

Spiked Light Shield

**Price** 53 GP/59 gp

**Type** martial

You can bash with a spiked light shield instead of using it for defense. A spiked light shield can't be disarmed. See the armor spikes entry on page 10 for details.

Starknife

**Price** 24 gp

**Type** martial

From a central metal ring, four tapering metal blades extend from this weapon like points on a compass rose. By gripping the crossbar that runs through the weapon's open middle, a wielder can strike with it as a deadly melee weapon. Alternatively, by gripping it by the outer rim, a starknife's light, aerodynamic design allows it to be thrown short distances in a manner similar to a chakram.

Sword Cane

**Price** 45 gp

**Type** martial

This slender light blade lies within a wooden container that serves as both its scabbard and hiding place. You can draw the blade as a swift action (or a free action if you have the [Quick Draw](feats.md#_quick-draw) feat). An observer must succeed at a DC 20 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check to realize an undrawn sword cane is a weapon rather than a walking stick; the DC decreases to 10 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. You can use the [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse) feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a sword cane sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a sword cane in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage.

Swordbreaker Dagger

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** exotic

You can use this dagger to disarm or sunder enemy blades by catching them in the grooves on the back of the blade and using your weapon as a lever. If you are proficient with this weapon, add a +4 bonus on combat maneuver checks to disarm or sunder bladed weapons while using it.

Taiaha

**Price** 10 gp

**Type** exotic

The Stone Age taiaha is a long, heavy stick, club-shaped at one end and tipped with a wooden or metal spear point at the other. You wield it with a combination of solid strikes with the club and fending motions with the spear. A taiaha can be wielded as a martial weapon that deals 1d8 points of bludgeoning damage (1d6 if Small) and has a ×2 critical.

Tekko-Kagi

**Price** 2 gp

**Type** exotic

Also known as an iron claw, this device consists of a fanlike structure of three or more 10-inch blades secured to a sturdy handle strapped to the forearm of the off hand. It can be used as an offensive weapon or defensively like a buckler, or used to disarm an opponent without provoking an attack of opportunity. It provides its owner with a +2 circumstance bonus on attempts to disarm or sunder swords or other slender-bladed weapons.

Temple Sword

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** exotic

Heavy blades typically used by guardians of religious sites, temple swords have distinctive crescent-shaped blades, which appear to be an amalgam of sickle and sword. Many have holes drilled into the blade or the pommel so that charms, bells, or other holy trinkets can be attached to reflect the owner's devotion or to serve as foci for prayer or meditation. Monks are proficient with the temple sword.

Tepoztopilli

**Price** 8 gp

**Type** martial

The head of this wooden Stone Age polearm is edged with jagged bits of obsidian, glass, teeth, or similar materials. The wide head serves well for both piercing and slashing attacks.

This Stone Age weapon, also called a macuahuitl, is made from a length of tempered wood. It has bits of shark teeth, obsidian, glass, or similar materials studded all along its length.

Tetsubo

**Price** 20 gp

**Type** exotic

A slight improvement over the greatclub, this weapon consists of a long, slender length of wood or metal whose upper half is shod with a thick sheet of studded iron. The iron gives added weight and strength to the club, while the studs are designed to crack helmets and armor.

throwing axe

**Price** 8 gp

**Type** martial

This one-handed axe is small and perfectly balanced for throwing, and can be used as a melee weapon. Throwing axes have a variety of alternative names, including franciscas, tomahawks, and more. The axe is normally gripped by the haft and thrown overhand, making one complete rotation in the air before biting into the target with the axe head.

throwing shield

**Price** +50 gp

**Type** exotic

This shield is designed for throwing and has specially designed straps that allow you to unclasp and throw it as a free action. Tower shields cannot be throwing shields. Neither a shield's enhancement bonus to AC nor its shield spikes apply on your attack or damage rolls. A throwing shield can't be disarmed.

Tiger Fork

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** martial

This long, tridentlike weapon consists of a three-pronged metal fork set upon an 8-foot-long shaft. It is wielded much like a staff, with the wielder grasping the shaft from the center and jabbing with its forked end. A tiger fork can be set to receive a charge.

Tonfa

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** martial

These L-shaped fighting batons are good for striking and blocking. The wielder holds the handle and either spins the stick or strikes with the stick covering the forearm.

Tube Arrow shooter

**Price** 3 gp

**Type** martial

This weapon consists of a small metal tube hidden within a sleeve; the tube holds a short, spring-loaded bamboo shaft. You gain a +2 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks made to conceal a tube arrow shooter on your body. Releasing the fastener allows the spring to force the arrow out. Once a shaft is fired, the tube must be reloaded before it can be used again. Reloading a tube is a full-round action, or a standard action if the wielder has the [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload) feat.

Two-Bladed Sword

**Price** 100 gp

**Type** exotic

A two-bladed sword is a double weapon—twin blades extend from either side of a central, short haft, allowing the wielder to attack with graceful but deadly flourishes.

Unarmed Strike

**Price** —

**Type** simple

An unarmed strike is an attack such as a punch or a kick where the attacker is not using a weapon to make the attack. A Medium character deals 1d3 points of nonlethal damage with an unarmed strike. A Small character deals 1d2 points of nonlethal damage. A monk or any character with the [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike) feat can deal lethal or nonlethal damage with unarmed strikes at his discretion. The damage from an unarmed strike is considered weapon damage for the purposes of effects that give you a bonus on weapon damage rolls.

An unarmed strike is always considered a light weapon. Therefore, you can use the [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse) feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with an unarmed strike. Unarmed strikes do not count as natural weapons (_Core Rulebook_ 182). An unarmed strike can't be disarmed.

Underwater Heavy Crossbow

**Price** 100 gp

**Type** simple

Above water, this weapon is identical to a heavy crossbow. You may use it underwater, where it has a range increment of 20 feet. It counts as a heavy crossbow for the purposes of proficiencies and special abilities.

Underwater light Crossbow

**Price** 70 gp

**Type** simple

An underwater light crossbow functions like its normal counterpart above water, and can be used underwater. When fired underwater, the crossbow has a range increment of 20 feet. Anyone proficient with a normal light crossbow can use an underwater light crossbow.

Urumi

**Price** 30 gp

**Type** exotic

Commonly known as a whip sword, this deadly weapon is fashioned from one to four 5-foot-long, razor-sharp blades of flexible steel, almost like a metal cat-o'-nine-tails. The weapon is wielded by whipping the blades at one's opponent. The coiled blade is fine and flexible enough to be worn as a belt, and its wielders often carry the blades wrapped around themselves in this fashion.

Wahaika

**Price** 3 gp

**Type** exotic

This short and broad Stone Age club is made of hardened wood or bone. It has a notch on one side that is used for catching weapons. If you are proficient with the weapon, you can use the notch in the wahaika to disarm your foes. Otherwise, treat this weapon as a club. Feats and abilities that affect clubs apply to the wahaika.

Wakizashi

**Price** 35 gp

**Type** exotic

These short, slender blades are between 1 to 2 feet long. They are primarily used as back-up weapons, to decapitate defeated enemies, or to commit seppuku (ritual suicide) as a matter of honor. These blades are specifically worn by samurai and are intended to be paired with a katana. Together, this set of blades is referred to as a daisho.

Warhammer

**Price** 12 gp

**Type** martial

This weapon consists of a wooden haft and a heavy, metal head. The head may be single (like a carpenter's hammer) or double (like a sledgehammer). The haft is long enough that you may wield it one- or two-handed. Though heavy and relatively slow to wield, warhammers are capable of delivering immense blows, crushing armor and flesh alike.

whip

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** exotic

A whip deals no damage to any creature with an armor bonus of +1 or higher or a natural armor bonus of +3 or higher. The whip is treated as a melee weapon with a 15-foot reach, though you don't threaten the area into which you can make an attack. In addition, unlike most other weapons with reach, you can use it against foes anywhere within your reach (including adjacent foes).

Using a whip provokes an attack of opportunity, just as if you had used a ranged weapon.

You can use the [Weapon Finesse](feats.md#_weapon-finesse) feat to apply your Dexterity modifier instead of your Strength modifier to attack rolls with a whip sized for you, even though it isn't a light weapon. You can't wield a whip in two hands in order to apply 1-1/2 times your Strength modifier to damage rolls.

Whistling arrow

**Price** 2 gp (20)

**Type** ammunition

These arrows come with specially designed grooves and fletching that cause them to emit a loud keening sound audible within 500 feet of their flight path. They are sold in quantities of 20.

Wooden stake

This close combat weapon is just a sharpened piece of wood. Iron spikes that are used as weapons deal damage as wooden stakes.

Wushu dart

**Price** 1 sp

**Type** martial

# Firearms

This section presents an anachronistic collection of hand-held black powder weapons suitable for a wide variety of fantasy adventure campaigns. Most of them are single-shot muzzle-loaders with highly inefficient triggering mechanisms—traditional sword and sorcery firearms. More advanced firearms are also presented for those brave enough to mix their fantasy with a technology much closer to that of the Old West than the slow and unstable weapons that gave musketeers their name. Of course, it is the GM's decision whether or not guns of any type are allowed in a campaign.

What follows are additional rules for using firearms.

**Firearm Proficiency** : The [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats.md#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) (firearms) feat allows you to use all firearms without penalty. A nonproficient character takes the standard –4 penalty on attack rolls with firearms, and a nonproficient character who loads a firearm increases all misfire values by 4 for the shots he loads.

Even though the [Exotic Weapon Proficiency](feats.md#_exotic-weapon-proficiency) (firearms) feat grants you proficiency with all firearms, anytime you take a feat that modifies a single type of weapon (such as [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) or [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload)), you must still pick one specific type of firearm (such as musket, axe musket, blunderbuss, pistol, or double pistol) for that feat to affect.

All firearms are part of the same weapon group for the purposes of the fighter's weapon training class feature.

**Firearm Categories** : The firearms in this chapter fall into one of two categories: early or advanced firearms.

> _Early Firearms:_ Early firearms are typically matchlock, wheellock, or flintlock weapons, and require more finesse and care to use than advanced firearms. Early firearms are muzzle-loaded, requiring a bullet and powder (or other special alchemical substances) to be shoved down the barrel before the weapon is fired. Early firearm ammunition can be loaded from a cartridge, but that cartridge is made of soft material (like paper or cloth) that is torn open so that the contents may be shoved down the barrel.
> 
> _Advanced Firearms:_ Advanced firearms are more reliable and accurate than early firearms. The ammunition for an advanced firearm takes the form of metal (usually brass) cartridges that are loaded into a chamber rather than shoved down the muzzle.

**Capacity** : A firearm's capacity is the number of shots it can hold at one time. When making a full-attack action, you may fire a firearm as many times in a round as you have attacks, up to this limit, unless you can reload the weapon as a swift or free action while making a full-attack action. In the case of early firearms, capacity often indicates the number of barrels a firearm has. In the case of advanced firearms, it typically indicates the number of chambers the weapon has.

**Range and Penetration** : Armor, whether manufactured or natural, provides little protection against the force of a bullet at short range.

> _Early Firearms:_ When firing an early firearm, the attack resolves against the target's touch AC when the target is within the first range increment of the weapon, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats and abilities such as [Deadly Aim](feats.md#_deadly-aim). At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative –2 penalty for each full range increment. Unlike other projectile weapons, early firearms have a maximum range of five range increments.
> 
> _Advanced Firearms:_ Advanced firearms resolve their attacks against touch AC when the target is within the first five range increments, but this type of attack is not considered a touch attack for the purposes of feats such as [Deadly Aim](feats.md#_deadly-aim). At higher range increments, the attack resolves normally, including taking the normal cumulative –2 penalty for each full-range increment. Advanced firearms have a maximum range of 10 range increments.

**Loading a Firearm** : You need at least one hand free to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. In the case of two-handed firearms, you hold the weapon in one hand and load it with the other—you only need to hold it in two hands to aim and shoot the firearm.

The [Rapid Reload](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_rapid-reload) feat reduces the time required to load one-handed and two-handed firearms. Loading any firearm provokes attacks of opportunity. Other rules for loading a firearm depend on whether the firearm is an early firearm or an advanced firearm.

> _Early Firearms:_ Early firearms are all muzzle-loaded, requiring bullets or pellets and black powder to be rammed down the muzzle. If an early firearm has multiple barrels, each barrel must be loaded separately. It is a standard action to load each barrel of a one-handed early firearm and a full-round action to load each barrel of a two-handed early firearm.
> 
> _Advanced Firearms:_ Advanced firearms are chamber-loaded. It is a move action to load a one-handed or two-handed advanced firearm to its full capacity.

**Misfires** : If the natural result of your attack roll with a firearm is equal to or less than the firearm's misfire value, that shot misses, even if you would have otherwise hit the target. When a firearm misfires, it gains the broken condition. While it has the broken condition, it suffers the normal disadvantages that broken weapons do, and its misfire value increases by 4 unless the wielder has gun training in the particular type of firearm. In that case, the misfire value increases by 2 instead of 4.

> _Early Firearms:_ If an early firearm with the broken condition misfires again, it explodes. When a nonmagical firearm explodes, the weapon is destroyed. Magical firearms are wrecked, which means they can't fire until they are fully restored (which requires either the make whole spell or the [Gunsmithing](ultimateCombat/ultimateCombatFeats.md#_gunsmithing) feat). When a gun explodes, pick one corner of your square—the explosion creates a burst from that point of origin. Each early firearm has a burst size noted in parentheses after its misfire value. Any creature within this burst (including the firearm's wielder) takes damage as if it had been hit by the weapon—a DC 12 Reflex save halves this damage.
> 
> _Advanced Firearms:_ Advanced firearms can misfire, but when they do, they only gain the broken condition. A subsequent misfire does not cause advanced firearms to explode.

**Ammunition** : Firearm ammunition takes two forms: either black powder and shot (either bullets or pellets) or cartridges. Firearm ammunition is destroyed when it is used. Unlike other types of ammunition, there is no chance to retrieve firearm ammunition that misses. No part of a cartridge can be reused to create new cartridges. Firearm ammunition cannot be treated with poison, unless you are using a pitted bullet.

**Concealing Firearms** : Like light weapons and hand crossbows, one-handed firearms are easy to conceal on your person. Some smaller firearms (like the coat pistol) can grant bonuses to conceal a weapon on your person.

**Bucklers** : You can use a one-handed or two-handed firearm without penalty while carrying a buckler.

**Fire while Prone** : Firearms, like crossbows, can be fired while their wielders are prone.

**Firearms, Black Powder, and Water** : Black powder becomes useless when exposed to water, but powder horns and cartridges protect black powder from exposure. You cannot normally load an early firearm underwater or fire any firearm underwater without magical aid.

**Deflecting and Snatching Bullets** : The Deflect Arrows feat and the [Snatch](monsters/monsterFeats.md#_snatch) Arrows feat can be used to deflect bullets, but not pellets shot from a scatter weapon.

**Scatter (Weapon Quality)** : A weapon with the scatter weapon quality can shoot two different types of ammunition. It can fire normal bullets that target one creature, or it can make a scattering shot, attacking all creatures within a cone. Cannons with the scatter weapon quality only fire grapeshot, unless their descriptions state otherwise. When a scatter weapon attacks all creatures within a cone, it makes a separate attack roll against each creature within the cone. Each attack roll takes a –2 penalty, and its attack damage cannot be modified by precision damage or damage-increasing feats such as [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike). Effects that grant concealment, such as fog or smoke, or the blur, invisibility, or mirror image spells, do not foil a scatter attack. If any of the attack rolls threaten a critical, confirm the critical for that attack roll alone. A firearm that makes a scatter shot misfires only if all of the attack rolls are misfires. If a scatter weapon explodes on a misfire, it deals triple its damage to all creatures within the misfire radius.

Alchemical Cartridge

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Dragon's breath | 40 gp | — |
| Entangling shot | 40 gp | — |
| Flare | 10 gp | — |
| Paper | 12 gp | — |
| Salt shot | 12 gp | — |

An alchemical cartridge is a prepared bundle of black powder with a bullet or pellets, sometimes with more exotic material added, which is then wrapped in paper or cloth and sealed with beeswax, lard, or tallow. There are many types of alchemical cartridges, the simplest being the paper cartridge—a simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet. Alchemical cartridges make loading a firearm easier, reducing the time to load a firearm by one step (a full-round action becomes a standard action, a standard action becomes a move action, and a move action becomes a free action), but they tend to be unstable. The misfire value of a weapon firing an alchemical cartridge increases as listed in each entry.

_Dragon's Breath Cartridge_: This cartridge contains alchemical compounds that, when fired, produce a cone of fire instead of the normal attack of a one-handed or two-handed firearm with the scatter weapon quality. The nonmagical flame deals 2d6 points of fire damage to all targets within the cone of the scatter firearm (DC 15 Reflex save for half). These cartridges cannot be used in firearms that don't have the scatter weapon quality. Because this ammunition forces a saving throw instead of making an attack roll, the misfire rules are slightly different. If you roll a 1 with either of the damage dice, the firearm misfires.

_Entangling Shot Cartridge_: This mix of black powder and an alchemically treated resin strong enough to survive the shot can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or another scatter weapon. It deals half damage to those hit by a cone attack made with this weapon, but any creature hit by the shot must succeed at a DC 15 Reflex saving throw or become entangled for 2d4 rounds. An entangling shot cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2.

_ [Flare](spells/flare.md#_flare) Cartridge_: When a flare cartridge hits its target, it deals only half the normal damage, but the creature struck is blinded for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 reduces this to dazzled), and creatures within a 20-foot burst are dazzled for 1 round (Fortitude DC 15 negates the effect). Flare cartridges are also useful for sending up signal flares. Firing a flare cartridge increases the firearm's misfire value by 2 unless it is fired from a blunderbuss or a dragon pistol, in which case doing so only increases the firearm's misfire value by 1. Flares can be used only to attack single creatures; they do not work as a shot for a scatter weapon's cone attack.

_Paper Cartridge_: This simple mix of black powder and either pellets or a bullet increases the misfire value by 1.

_Salt Shot Cartridge_: This mix of black powder and rock salt can only be loaded into a blunderbuss, a dragon pistol, or other scatter weapon. It deals nonlethal instead of lethal damage, and increases the misfire value by 1. You can use it only with a scatter weapon's cone attack.

Axe Musket

**Price** 1,600 gp

**Type** early

This short musket features an axe blade at the end of its barrel. It can be used as both a musket and a battleaxe. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the axe are considered broken. An axe musket uses either a bullet and a single dose of black powder or an alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Black Powder

| Amount | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 dose | 10 gp | — |
| 1 keg | 1,000 gp | 5 lbs. |

Black powder is the key explosive component within a firearm that enables it to function, but in larger amounts this alchemical material can be quite destructive on its own as well. A single dose of black powder is enough to power a single shot from most one-handed and two-handed firearms, while 10 doses are required to fire a cannon. Black powder is often stored and transported in kegs (which hold 100 doses), but in this quantity the powder itself becomes dangerous. Exposure to fire, electricity, or a misfire explosion causes black powder to explode—a single keg that explodes in this manner deals 5d6 points of fire damage to anyone within a 20-foot burst (DC 15 Reflex half). Storing black powder in a powder horn protects the powder from explosion.

Blunderbuss

**Price** 2,000 gp

**Type** early

This weapon fires pellets or a bullet from its trumpet-shaped barrel, making it an effective fowling weapon or close-fighting personal defense weapon. The blunderbuss fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A blunderbuss uses a bullet or pellets and a single dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Buckler Gun

**Price** 750 gp

**Type** early

The front of this buckler is fitted with a small, double-barreled gun that can be shot while wearing the buckler. Unlike with a double-barreled pistol, you can shoot only one barrel at a time. You must remove the buckler to reload the gun. Each barrel of a buckler gun uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. Because of its awkward construction, a buckler gun is always considered an off-handed weapon. This is an early firearm.

Coat Pistol

**Price** 750 gp

**Type** early

Though less powerful than other, larger firearms, this pistol is small enough to be easily concealed in a jacket or coat. You get a +2 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks made to conceal a coat pistol on your body. A coat pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Culverin

**Price** 4,000 gp

**Type** early

The culverin, also known as a hand bombard, consists of a simple smoothbore tube, sealed at one end except for a small hole used to ignite a gunpowder charge. A wooden stock partially encases the barrel, allowing you to hold it under your arm with relative ease when carrying it. Firing a culverin without support (such as a wall, a window, or a stand) imposes a –4 penalty on attack rolls, and knocks you prone. A culverin uses 4 doses of black powder and grapeshot (a handful of pellets) as ammunition. Note that these statistics simulate only the original, hand-held culverins—their larger descendants are considered cannons and are dealt with in the siege weapon section of _Ultimate Combat_. This is an early firearm.

Dagger Pistol

**Price** 740 gp

**Type** early

A combination of a coat pistol and a blade, the dagger pistol can be used as both weapons. The awkwardness of the configuration means you do not gain the bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks that either of those stand-alone weapons grants. The dagger pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the dagger component are considered broken. A dagger pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Double Hackbut

**Price** 4,000 gp

**Type** early

This double-length rifle uses a pair of trunnions to mount its barrel into a swiveling mechanism fastened to the top of a lightweight, two-wheeled carriage. It takes a full-round action to set up the carriage. The carriage has a hind leg, allowing the wielder to wheel the device about and immediately prop it for stability during combat. Unlike other two-handed firearms, you must fire the double hackbut while it is mounted, or else firing it imparts a –4 penalty on attack rolls and the recoil knocks you prone. A Large or larger creature can fire a double hackbut one size smaller than itself without the gun's mounting as a normal two-handed weapon and without the danger of being knocked prone, but takes the normal penalty for firing an inappropriately sized weapon. This is an early firearm.

Double-barreled musket

**Price** 2,500 gp

**Type** early

This musket has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be shot independently as a separate action, or both can be fired at once as the same attack. If both barrels are fired at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the gun becomes wildly inaccurate, taking a –4 penalty on each shot. Each barrel of a double-barreled musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Double-barreled pistol

**Price** 1,750 gp

**Type** early

This pistol has two parallel barrels; each barrel can be fired independently as a separate action, or both can be shot at once with the same action. If both barrels are shot at once, they must both target the same creature or object, and the pistol becomes wildly inaccurate, imposing a –4 penalty on each shot. This is an early firearm.

Double-barreled shotgun

**Price** 7,000 gp

**Type** advanced

This twin-barreled shotgun can be shot one barrel at a time, or both together as one attack. A double shot that fires bullets is inaccurate, and takes a –4 penalty on both attacks. A double shot that fires bullets targets only a single creature and increases the damage of each barrel to 2d6 points (Small) or 2d8 points (Medium) for a total of 4d6 or 4d8 points of damage. A double-barreled shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.

Dragon Pistol

**Price** 1,000 gp

**Type** early

Like a miniature blunderbuss, the dragon pistol fires pellets or a bullet from its flared barrel. The dragon pistol fires in a 15-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 10-foot range increment when firing a bullet. A dragon pistol uses either a bullet or group of pellets and 1 dose of black powder, or a single alchemical cartridge (with either bullets or pellets) as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Fire Lance

**Price** 25 gp

**Type** early

This primitive firearm is merely a long tube that, when ignited, propels forth a short gout of flame and a javelin. Unlike other firearms, the fire lance is wildly imprecise, and targets AC rather than touch AC. A fire lance is always treated as having the broken condition for the purpose of determining the effects of a misfire. A fire lance uses a javelin and 2 doses of black powder as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Firearm bullet

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** ammunition

The ammunition of most one-handed and two-handed firearms, firearm bullets typically take the form of small balls of lead or some other metal. Thirty bullets weigh half a pound.

Metal Cartridge

**Price** 15 gp

**Type** ammunition

These sturdier versions of alchemical cartridges serve as the ammunition for advanced firearms. They can hold either bullets or pellets.

musket

**Price** 1,500 gp

**Type** early

This long-barreled firearm has a much greater range than a pistol. A musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as its ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Pellets

**Price** 1 gp

**Type** ammunition

A handful of pellets, along with 1 dose of black powder, is commonly used as ammunition for one-handed and two-handed firearms with the scatter weapon quality, though rocks or other small bits of hard material can be used in the pellets' place. Using anything other than pellets or alchemical cartridges when firing off a cone attack with a scatter weapon increases the weapon's misfire range by 1 (though this increase can be removed by switching back to standard ammunition). Thirty handfuls of pellets weigh half a pound.

Pepperbox

**Price** 3,000 gp

**Type** early

This pistol has six barrels instead of one. The entire barrel housing can be quickly rotated by hand between shots (a free action requiring one free hand), allowing all six bullets to be fired before the weapon must be reloaded. Each barrel of a pepperbox uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Pepperbox Rifle

**Price** 7,000 gp

**Type** advanced

The four barrels of this rifle are set into a turnable housing that can be quickly rotated by hand (a free action) between shots. A pepperbox rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.

Pistol

**Price** 1,000 gp

**Type** early

The basic single-shot pistol is one of the most common firearms, although in most campaigns it is still rare enough to be an object of envy or curiosity to most. As such, it can take a variety of different forms, from wildly ornate masterpieces in the shape of fire-breathing dragons to the more common wood-handled pistols, or nothing more than a simple metal tube with a triggering device.

A pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.

Pitted Bullet

**Price** 5 gp

**Type** ammunition

This ammunition is pitted with a pattern of small pocks into which specially formulated poison compounds can be applied. A poison compound is a derivative of a standard toxin that is alchemically reduced to a solid form. These can be made from any standard injury or contact poison with a successful [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) (poison) check equal to the poison's DC + 4. The cost of purchasing an already prepared poison compound for the purpose of treating pitted bullets is equal to the poison's base cost + 20 gp. Once crafted, the compound can be pasted into the ammunition's pitted design and allowed to harden. Upon completion, the bullet can be fired from an appropriate firearm, releasing the poison compound into its target upon impact, but the poison's DC is reduced by 2. A pitted bullet cannot be used with an alchemical cartridge. The listed cost does not include the cost of poison.

Revolver

**Price** 4,000 gp

**Type** advanced

A revolver is a pistol with a revolving cylinder containing six chambers. Each chamber can hold a metal cartridge, and when one cartridge is fired, the cylinder automatically rotates (no extra hand or action required), readying the next chamber for firing. A revolver uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.

Rifle

**Price** 5,000 gp

**Type** advanced

This improvement on the musket features a grooved barrel that imparts a twisting, spiral motion to the bullet as it exits, stabilizing it and preventing the end-over-end tumbling common to projectiles from simpler firearms. As a result, a rifle can fire significantly farther and with more accuracy than early long-bore firearms.

A rifle uses metal cartridges as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.

Shotgun

**Price** 5,000 gp

**Type** advanced

This advanced version of the blunderbuss shoots in a 30-foot cone when firing pellets, and has a 20-foot range increment when firing a bullet (often called a slug). Shotguns can either be simple and functional, or art pieces in their own right, with engravings and inlay on the stocks and breeches. Those used by the upper class are often emblazoned with images of game animals, family crests, or elaborate maker's marks.

A shotgun uses metal cartridges (loaded with either a bullet or pellets) as ammunition. This is an advanced firearm.

sword cane Pistol

**Price** 775 gp

**Type** early

A combination weapon, this gun mixes a coat pistol with a sword cane. The sword cane pistol is considered a double weapon for the purpose of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. The pistol attachment makes the nature of the weapon a little more difficult to hide. An observer must succeed at a DC 15 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check to realize that an undrawn sword cane pistol is a weapon rather than a simple walking stick; the DC decreases to 5 if the observer is able to handle the weapon. A sword cane pistol uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. The sword part of the weapon must be drawn in order to load the pistol part of the weapon. This is an early firearm.

Warhammer Musket

**Price** 1,600 gp

**Type** early

This musket has a warhammer head at the end of its barrel, which allows it to be used as both a musket and a warhammer. It is considered a double weapon for the purposes of creating masterwork or magical versions of this weapon. If this firearm gains the broken condition, both the firearm component and the warhammer are considered broken. A warhammer musket uses either a bullet and 1 dose of black powder or a single alchemical cartridge as ammunition. This is an early firearm.
