These soft leather sandals have soles that consist of a layer of purple velvet decorated with intricate gold stitching. When slipped onto the feet, they feel as weightless as air. In any round when the wearer has already moved at least 10 feet along the ground or another surface (not counting travel on a mount or vehicle), these boots can be activated as a swift action to give the wearer the ability to walk on air (as the _ [air walk](spells/airWalk.md#_air-walk)_ spell) until the end of the round. If the wearer hasn't reached a solid surface by the end of the round, she immediately falls back to the ground, taking any applicable falling damage. These sandals can be used up to 5 times per day, but no more often than once per minute.
