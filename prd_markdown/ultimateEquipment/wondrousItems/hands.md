- When the wearer makes an attack using [Arcane Strike](feats#_arcane-strike) and hits, enemies adjacent to the target take damage equal to the wearer's [Arcane Strike](feats#_arcane-strike) damage bonus. This damage is of the same type as the weapon's damage (bludgeoning, piercing, and so on).

Gloves of Shaping

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

These soft leather gloves are constantly encrusted with clay between the fingers and allow the reshaping of otherwise durable materials. The wearer can shape objects with hardness 8 or lower (stone, wood, leather, and so on) as if it were soft clay. While it's possible to rapidly make crude shapes (shaping roughly 1 cubic foot of material per round), creating fine detail or moving parts requires additional time and an appropriate [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) check, at the GM's discretion.

Materials with more than 8 points of hardness are still affected, though not so dramatically. The wearer may treat these materials as having half as much hardness when attempting to damage or reshape them. For instance, a steel bar normally has 10 points of hardness, but the wearer of the gloves may treat it as having hardness 5, and shape it with woodworking tools.

The gloves only affect shaping materials with the wearer's hands or handheld tools, and only when the wearer desires to do so.

Gloves of the Commanding Conjurer

**Price** 30,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

These gloves grant the wearer greater control over his summoned creatures. As long as he wears the gloves, creatures conjured by the wearer can understand him as if they shared a common language. This communication is not two-way and does not grant the wearer the ability to understand the creature.

Three times per day, the wearer can attempt to take control of a summoned creature within 50 feet as if using _ [control summoned creature](ultimateMagic/spells/controlSummonedCreature#_control-summoned-creature)_ (Will DC 16).

Construction Requirements

Gloves of The Shortened Path

**Price** 27,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

Once per day on command, the wearer of these oxblood leather gloves can bend space to extend her reach to a non-adjacent square within line of sight. For the next 10 rounds, she can touch anything in that square as if it were her own square, as long as she has line of effect to the target square. She may change the targeted square as a swift action.

When using the gloves to touch, attack, or manipulate anything in the square, the wearer's arms and hands also appear in that square, allowing creatures and effects to target her as if she were in that square. She cannot use this connection to transfer anything from her square to the target square, or vice versa. If she drops anything, it lands in her square. She can use her hands (including natural attacks from those hands, if any), hand-held objects (such as lockpicks), and melee weapons in that square as if she were there. The square is part of her threatened area, though she cannot use the gloves to provide flanking for herself. She cannot use the gloves to grapple, make ranged attacks, or make attacks that require her to move out of her actual square (such as a bull rush combat maneuver).

Interacting with the target square is distracting, and anything that threatens her in her actual square automatically flanks her.

If the wearer or her square is blocked from using teleportation or planar travel effects (such as _ [dimensional anchor](spells/dimensionalAnchor#_dimensional)_), the gloves do not function. She cannot use the gloves to target a square protected by such an effect.

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** faint universal; **CL** 1st; **Weight** —

This print glows any color the wearer wishes, sheds light as a candle, and is easily visible from a distance of up to 60 feet. Such handprints last for 1 day before fading away. The glowing handprint matches the wearer's hand in terms of size, position of fingers, and so on.

**Cost** 1,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [arcane mark](spells/arcaneMark#_arcane-mark)_

Glyphbane Gloves

**Price** 9,000 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

These dark-brown, leather gloves are etched over their entire surface with arcane insignia. The wearer gains a +5 competence bonus on [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) checks made to disable magical traps. Once per day, if the wearer's check to disarm a glyph, rune, or similar writing-based magical trap exceeds the DC by 10 or more, she may change the trigger condition of the trap instead of disabling it. The new trigger condition must be one allowed by the magical trap; for example, a _ [glyph of warding](spells/glyphOfWarding#_glyph-of-warding)_ cannot be set according to class, HD, or level, even when manipulated by the gloves.

Construction Requirements

Iron Cobra Gauntlet

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 Lb.

This elbow-length scaled metal gauntlet flares at the wrist like a cobra's hood. Up to three times per day, the wearer way transform the gauntlet into an iron cobra , which crawls from the wearer's wrist and obeys his commands, leaving behind a simple bracelet of linked scales. Whoever wears the bracelet is the iron cobra's master. The iron cobra can remain animated for a total of 1 hour per day.

If the snake is within hearing range of the master and commanded to revert to gauntlet form (a standard action), it travels to its master as fast as possible, crawls onto its master's arm, and as a free action reverts to its inactive shape. If the snake's duration expires before it can reach its master, it reverts to gauntlet form, but automatically melds with the bracelet if the two touch.

If slain in cobra form, the snake reverts to gauntlet form and cannot be used again for 24 hours. If destroyed in gauntlet form, the item is destroyed. The wearer can refill the iron cobra's poison reservoir in snake form or gauntlet form.

Magnetist's Gloves

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

These thin leather gloves have delicate steel wires running through them. Three times per day as a standard action, the wearer of these gloves may attempt a disarm combat maneuver on a target within 30 feet. The target's item must be mostly made of metal. If the combat maneuver check is successful, the target is disarmed and the item falls to the ground in the target's square. For every 5 by which the check exceeds the DC, the item lands 1 square closer to the wearer. If this would place the item in the wearer's square, the wearer may attempt to catch the item with a DC 10 Dexterity check; otherwise it lands in the wearer's square. The wearer can only use this ability if she has at least one hand free. If the wearer fails the combat maneuver check, she is not disarmed.

Pliant Gloves

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

Wearing these form-fitting fingerless black gloves makes the wearer's arms and body more flexible. As a swift action, the wearer can lengthen his arms for up to 10 rounds per day, gaining an additional 5 feet of reach. These rounds need not be consecutive. Attacking with these extended arms is unwieldy, and the wearer takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, increasing to –4 if he is using two-handed weapons. Even when his limbs aren't extended, the wearer gains a +5 enhancement bonus on [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) checks and [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) checks to avoid falling damage. The wearer is still able to use hand-based natural attacks such as claws while wearing the gloves.

The gloves are used primarily by assassins to deliver poisons while in combat. Each glove may be filled with a single dose of poison, a potion, alchemist infusion, holy water, or similar liquid as long as the liquid would not harm the gloves (for example, alchemist's fire and acid cannot be used). The wearer can deliver the dose to a target as a melee touch attack or as part of an unarmed strike or natural attack with the hands (such as a claw or slam attack). The wearer can use both gloves in the same round using two-weapon fighting or multiple natural attacks (such as 2 slams or 2 claws). Each glove can be used once per day. Filling a glove is a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity.

Shadow Falconer's Glove

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This elbow-length, heavy leather glove's fine embroidery is marred by dozens of claw marks. Once per day on command, its wearer can gesture toward a creature within 30 feet. When he does, a featureless silhouette of a bird of prey appears, swoops toward the target, and performs a disarm or steal combat maneuver (wearer's choice, CMB +16). The shadow falcon is a magical effect, not a creature, and this action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. If the hand wearing the glove is empty, the shadow falcon brings the item to the wearer's hand. If the gloved hand is occupied, the shadow falcon deposits the item on the ground in an unoccupied space adjacent to the wearer. The shadow falcon then disappears.

Spellstrike Gloves

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** strong (no school); **CL** 17th; **Weight** —

These black leather gloves are lined with soft black velveteen and have silver buckles that run from the wrist to the elbow. Three times per day, the gloves allow the wearer to treat a ranged magus spell as a spell with a range of “touch,” allowing him to deliver the spell with his spellstrike ability. The glove can only affect spells that normally affect one or more creatures at a range greater than “touch” (such as _ [slow](spells/slow#_slow)_), not rays or other created effects. The altered spell only affects the creature attacked (any other targets normally allowed by the spell are lost).

Talons of Leng

**Price** 67,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Finely laid gold filigree lines these ornately worked talons. Once donned, the _talons of Leng_ grant the wearer a natural claw attack with each hand that deal 1d4 points of damage for a Medium wearer, or 1d3 points of damage for a Small wearer. These claw attacks have a +3 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls. On a critical hit, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Will save or become permanently confused as per the _ [insanity](spells/insanity#_insanity)_ spell. This is a mind-affecting effect.

The wearer of the _talons of Leng_ is immune to effects that grant the confused condition. For as long as she wears the talons, however, her Wisdom is reduced by 2, as alien voices constantly whisper through her head. The _talons of Leng_ do not interfere with spellcasting, the use of handheld items, or wielding weapons.

Trapspringer's Gloves

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

These studded leather gloves look similar to workman's gloves, though they are reinforced with numerous metal strips that the user can extend or retract as she wills, turning the tip of each finger into a customizable tool useful in examining and disarming traps. While worn, these gloves grant a +5 competence bonus on all [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) checks made to disarm traps. In addition, the gloves grant the user a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws made against traps.

Vampiric Gloves

**Price** 18,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

These pale, elegant-looking leather gloves have blood-red stitching on the fingers—which bears a startling resemblance to blood-encrusted fingernails. Three times per day, the wearer can use _ [vampiric touch](spells/vampiricTouch#_vampiric-touch)_ and _ [bleed](spells/bleed#_bleed)_. If the wearer uses _ [vampiric touch](spells/vampiricTouch#_vampiric-touch)_ and holds the charge, the charge dissipates if the gloves are removed.

Though _ [vampiric touch](spells/vampiricTouch#_vampiric-touch)_ is normally a touch attack, the wearer may instead use that ability as a ranged touch attack with a range of 30 feet, but only against a dying target or a target suffering from a bleed effect. When using _ [vampiric touch](spells/vampiricTouch#_vampiric-touch)_ in this way, the wearer may hold the charge on a missed ranged touch attack.

If the wearer is suffering from a bleed effect, he may expend one use of _ [vampiric touch](spells/vampiricTouch#_vampiric-touch)_ to end the bleed effect.
