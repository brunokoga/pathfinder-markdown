Batrachian Helm

**Price** 26,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This oily bronze helm is fashioned in the shape of a frog's head. Three times per day as a swift action, the helm fires an unerring tongue of force at a visible target within 20 feet.

If the target is an unattended object weighing 250 pounds or less, it is pulled 20 feet toward the wearer. If the target is a creature of the wearer's size or smaller, the wearer may make a combat maneuver check as a free action to pull the target 20 feet toward him.

If the target is a creature larger than the wearer, an unattended object weighing more than 250 pounds, or an immobile structure such as a wall, the wearer is pulled 20 feet toward the target. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity, and the object or creature stops if the movement would move it into a solid object or creature.

Cat's Eye Crown

**Price** 18,000 gp; **Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This slender silver crown is decorated with a single cat's eye gemstone as a centerpiece. When the gem is attached to the crown, its wearer gains darkvision 60 feet, or increases her darkvision by 60 feet if she already possesses that sense. The gemstone is detachable, and can be rolled into rooms, dropped into holes, thrown through windows, or planted on a creature. Once per day, on command, the crown's wearer gains the benefit of the _ [clairaudience/clairvoyance](spells/clairaudienceClairvoyance#_clairaudience-clairvoyance)_ spell, but uses the cat's eye gemstone as that spell's sensor and gains darkvision when viewing through that sensor. If the stone is held or carried by a creature, even within a sack or some other container, the creature wearing the crown uses the senses of the creature carrying the gemstone as the sensor instead, whether or not the creature carrying the gemstone is aware of the stone's true purpose or even its existence. Destroying the gem (hardness 8, hp 5) severs the link, but a new cat's eye gemstone worth at least 100 gp can be fashioned and attuned to the crown. The attunement process takes 24 hours.

The circlet does not interfere with the wearer's ability to see normally. If the wearer has blindsense or blindsight, he is able to differentiate creatures detected with those senses from creatures detected with the _circlet of mindsight_.

She also gains a +5 sacred bonus on [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (planes) checks regarding outsiders with the good or evil subtypes, and any effect she creates with the good descriptor takes effect at +1 caster level.

A _crown_, an _orb_, and a _scepter of heaven_—collectively known as a _regalia of heaven_—increase in power when used together. If the wearer of a _crown of heaven _wields an _orb_ or _scepter of heaven_, effects she creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level, and she gains a +1 sacred bonus to AC and on saves against attacks or effects created by evil creatures. She also radiates an _aura of menace_ in a 20-foot radius. Any evil creature within this aura takes a –2 penalty on attack rolls, on saving throws, and to AC until it successfully hits the wearer of the regalia (DC 20 Will negates). A creature that saves is immune to this effect for 24 hours. If the aura is dispelled, the wearer can restore it as a standard action.

If the crown is worn while the wearer is wielding both an _orb_ and _scepter of heaven_, the crown's caster level increases to 15th, effects the wearer creates with the good descriptor gain an additional +1 caster level increase, and her sacred bonus to AC and saves increases to +2.

A _crown of heaven _bestows one negative level on any evil creature bearing it, which cannot be removed or overcome while carrying the crown. If the same creature carries an _orb _or _scepter of heaven, _it gains one additional negative level per object. An evil creature intentionally donning a _crown of heaven _gains an additional negative level and is affected as _ [bestow curse](spells/bestowCurse#_bestow-curse) _(DC 17) immediately and every 24 hours that the crown is worn. A neutral character can attempt a DC 17 Fortitude save to avoid gaining these negative levels.

Helm of Brilliance

**Price** 125,000 gp; **Aura** strong varied; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This normal-looking helm takes its true form and manifests its powers when the user dons it and speaks the command word. Made of brilliant silver and polished steel, a newly created helm is set with large magic gems: 10 diamonds, 20 rubies, 30 fire opals, and 40 opals. When struck by bright light, the helm scintillates and sends forth reflective rays in all directions from its crown-like, gem-tipped spikes. The jewels' functions are as follows:

- Diamond: _ [Prismatic spray](spells/prismaticSpray#_prismatic-spray)_ (save DC 20)
- Ruby: _ [Wall of fire](spells/wallOfFire#_wall-of-fire)_
- Fire opal: _ [Fireball](spells/fireball#_fireball)_ (10d6, Reflex DC 20 half)
- Opal: [Daylight](spells/daylight#_daylight)

The helm may be used once per round, but each gem can perform its spell-like power just once. Until all its jewels are depleted, a _helm of brilliance_ also has the following magical properties when activated.

It emanates a bluish light when undead are within 30 feet. This light causes 1d6 points of damage per round to all such creatures within that range.

The wearer may command any weapon he wields to become a _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-flaming)_ weapon. This is in addition to whatever abilities the weapon may already have (unless the weapon already is a _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-flaming)_ weapon). The command takes 1 round to take effect.

The helm provides fire resistance 30. This protection does not stack with similar protection from other sources.

Once all its jewels have lost their magic, the helm loses its powers and the gems turn to worthless powder. Removing a jewel destroys it.

If a creature wearing the helm is damaged by magical fire (after the fire protection is taken into account) and fails an additional DC 15 Will save, the remaining gems on the helm overload and detonate. Remaining diamonds become _prismatic sprays_ that each randomly target a creature within range (possibly the wearer), rubies become straight-line _walls of fire_ extending outward in a random direction from the helm wearer, and fire opals become _fireballs_ centered on the helm wearer. The opals and the helm itself are destroyed.

Helm of Brilliance, Lesser

**Price** 36,000 gp; **Aura** moderate varied; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This helm functions like a _helm of brilliance_ but is lower-powered. Instead of the standard helm's allotment of gems, the lesser helm has 10 diamonds (_ [fireball](spells/fireball#_fireball)_, 10d6 damage, Reflex DC 20 half), 20 corals (_ [flaming sphere](spells/flamingSphere#_flaming-sphere)_), 30 garnets (_ [scorching ray](spells/scorchingRay#_scorching-ray)_), and 40 agates (_ [light](spells/light#_light)_). It still glows near and harms undead, has the _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-flaming)_ weapon special ability, and provides fire resistance (though only 20 instead of 30).

Just like the standard helm, the wearer risks detonation if damaged by magical fire; diamonds become _fireballs_ centered on the wearer, corals become _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-flaming) spheres_ in and adjacent to the wearer's space, garnets become _scorching rays_ that fire randomly at creatures in range, and the agates and the helm itself are destroyed.

**Price** 125,000 gp; **Aura** strong varied; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

Other aspects of the helm, such as detecting and damaging undead, remain unchanged.

Magician's Hat

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

Mystic symbols embroidered in gold thread decorate this conical hat. Three times per day as a free action when casting a spell, the wearer can shift metamagic feats on prepared spells. The wearer can either move a metamagic feat from another prepared spell to a spell being cast or from the spell being cast to another prepared spell. In either case, the spell that gains the metamagic feat can't exceed the spell slot of the spell that originally had the metamagic feat. For example, a wizard with _ [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_, _silent [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_, and _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door)_ prepared could cast a _silent [detect thoughts](spells/detectThoughts#_detect-thoughts)_ (and would now have _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_ prepared), but could not cast _silent [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door)_. Moving metamagic feats does not increase spell casting time, even for quickened spells. The hat provides no benefit to spontaneous casting or spell-like abilities.
