Shifter's Headband

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

**+2 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma** 4,500 gp; **+4 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma** 17,500 gp; **+6 Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma** 39,000 gp

This band of reddish fox fur is marked on the front with a distinctive symbol that constantly shifts into a different character. The headband grants the wearer an enhancement bonus to one mental ability score (Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma) of +2, +4, or +6. Treat this as a temporary ability bonus for the first 24 hours the headband is worn. This bonus is chosen when the headband is created and cannot be changed. If the headband grants a bonus to Intelligence, it also grants skill ranks as a _headband of vast intelligence_.

If the wearer is a creature who uses magic to change form, she gains the following additional benefits.

_Shifter's headband +2_: The wearer treats her caster level as if it were one level higher when casting spells or creating extracts of the polymorph subschool.

_Shifter's headband +4_: Once per day while under the effect of a polymorph spell or extract, the wearer can assume another form allowed by that effect. This is a standard action.

_Shifter's headband +6_: Whenever the wearer changes her shape with a polymorph effect, she gains DR 5/silver for 1 minute (this ends if she returns to her natural form).

These additional shapeshifter abilities are cumulative. For example, a creature wearing a _shifter's headband +4_ gains the extra transformation ability and treats her caster level as 1 higher than normal for polymorph spells and extracts.

Soulbound Eye

**Price** 30,000 gp; **Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 16th; **Weight** —

Appearing at first like an expensive, masochistic adornment, this almond-sized star ruby is set in a gold clasp, one side of which is festooned with several long spikes. A _soulbound eye_ is not an item that most creatures would voluntarily wear—they are instead crafted by powerful creatures who wish to use another creature as a sort of remote-viewing slave. A _soulbound eye_ must be attached to a willing or helpless creature by pressing the spike-covered surface to the creature's brow—the gem swiftly and painfully embeds itself in the victim's forehead, immediately activating to forge a shared link between the wearer and the creature who placed the item on its head (the “master”).

Once implanted, the _soulbound eye_ allows the master to observe the world around the wearer through the wearer's senses. It also allows for telepathic communication between the wearer and the master. Neither of these features function across planar boundaries.

The _soulbound eye's_ wearer is not compelled to obey its master's telepathic commands, but the master can use the _soulbound eye_ as a conduit for _ [hold monster](spells/holdMonster.md#_hold-monster)_, _ [modify memory](spells/modifyMemory.md#_modify-memory)_, _ [pain strike](advanced/spells/painStrike.md#_pain-strike)_ , and _ [suggestion](spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ spells, treating the wearer as the target of the spell no matter the distance between master and wearer. The victim is allowed any normal saving throws or spell resistance against spells cast through the _soulbound eye._

An implanted _soulbound eye_ functions like a cursed item once it is in place—it can only be removed if the curse is first lifted via an effect like _ [remove curse](spells/removeCurse.md#_remove-curse)_ or _ [break enchantment](spells/breakEnchantment.md#_break-enchantment)_. Once removed, a _soulbound eye_ crumbles to fragments.

Veiled Eye

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This banded agate attaches itself to its wearer's forehead and then, blinking and focusing, begins to act as an additional eye. When worn, the _veiled eye_ has the same vision as the wearer (such as low-light vision, darkvision 60 ft., or the oracle's clouded vision curse). It grants the wearer no particular advantages so long as his original eyes continue to function normally. However, should his original eyes stop working, whether because of the wearer becoming blinded or even his own decision to close them, he can see through the _veiled eye _instead. When the wearer is using the veiled eye as his only vision source, he takes a –2 penalty on ranged attack rolls but gains a +2 insight bonus on saves against gaze attacks.

**Price** 32,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Crafted of pale bone or silver, this headband features a snarling wolf's head centered on the wearer's forehead. The wearer gains cold resistance 10. Once per day, the wearer may transform into a Large white-furred wolf for 11 minutes. In addition, once per day the wearer may breathe a 30-foot cone of cold that deals 7d6 points of cold damage (Reflex DC 16 for half). The wearer may use this breath weapon even when transformed.
