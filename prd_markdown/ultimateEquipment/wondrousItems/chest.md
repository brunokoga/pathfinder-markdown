All Tools Vest

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This well-made leather vest bears numerous shiny metal buttons, which stud a number of bulging pockets. Once per day, as a standard action, the wearer can speak the vest's command word and order it to bring forth all the standard tools required to make checks for any one [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) skill. These tools appear in the countless pockets of the vest or, if too heavy, on the floor, on a nearby shelf, on a workbench, or in a toolbox or cupboard that appears nearby. Once summoned, they remain for 24 hours or until another creature touches them, whichever comes first.

Bandages of Rapid Recovery

**Price** 200 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 1st; **Weight** 1 lb.

These linen bandages have the same color and softness as the feathers of a dove, but their antiseptic smell suggests a less natural origin. Any creature wrapped in these bandages recovers from wounds and ability damage each day as if receiving complete bed rest, regardless of activity . A creature actually receiving long-term care (from the [Heal](skills/heal#_heal) skill) or complete bed rest while wearing the bandages gains a +4 bonus to its effective level or Hit Dice when determining how many hit points it recovers each day. The bandages are destroyed once removed or when the wearer recovers all hit points and ability damage, whichever comes first.

Bane Baldric

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This ornate sash of embroidered velvet stretches across the chest from shoulder to waist. If the wearer is an inquisitor, she is treated as five levels higher when using her bane and greater bane abilities. If the wearer is not an inquisitor, she gains the bane ability of a 5th-level inquisitor, but must first attune a light or one-handed melee weapon to the baldric by hanging it from the cloth for 24 hours, and can only use the bane ability with the attuned weapon. Attuning a new weapon to the baldric ends the attunement for the previous weapon.

Cackling Hag's Blouse

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This loose-fitting blouse is adorned with grotesque fetishes and trophies, granting the wearer a +2 competence bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks. If the wearer is a witch, she gains the cackle hex. If the wearer already has the cackle hex, twice per day she can use her cackle ability as a swift action instead of a move action.

This rough vest of black snakeskin is decorated with a fringe of rawhide tassels, each knotted around a bit of bone or a small animal skull. A gunslinger with the deadeye deed reduces the grit point cost to use that deed by 1 (minimum 1 grit).

In addition, once per day when the wearer reduces a creature to 0 or fewer hit points with a firearm she can use _ [death knell](spells/deathKnell#_death-knell)_ (Will DC 13 negates) against that target as a swift action. She does not have to touch the target to activate this ability, but her range increment penalty for shooting the target also applies to the saving throw DC of the _ [death knell](spells/deathKnell#_death-knell)_ (for example, if the range increment penalty is –2, the DC is 11).

Endless Bandolier

**Price** 1,500 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Small loops sewn into this bandolier look like they can hold twenty alchemical cartridges (ammunition for a firearm, see _Ultimate Combat_), but due to a subtle bending of space can actually hold up to 60 cartridges. Additionally, the six thin pockets on the bandolier are extradimensional spaces meant to hold extra guns and gear. The four small pockets can each hold a one-handed firearm, 1 pound of ammunition, a powder horn, or a similarly sized object. The two large pockets are large enough to hold a two-handed firearm or a similarly sized object. The wearer can draw an item stored in the bandolier as easily as if from an ordinary ammunition pouch or holster. The bandolier weighs the same no matter what is placed inside it.

Mantle of Immortality

**Price** 50,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This elegant cape, trimmed in gold in a pattern resembling an ancient maze, forestalls the negative effects of aging. The wearer no longer suffers penalties to Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution from being of middle age or older . The penalties return if the robe is removed (or its powers suppressed), and the sudden weight of years is so traumatic that the wearer must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or be exhausted for 24 hours. Donning the robe again removes the age penalties, but does not remove this exhaustion, which must pass on its own or be remedied with magic.

She has access to these mercies for 24 hours. When the wearer uses a mercy to remove a condition caused by a curse, disease, or poison, the mercy actually cures the source curse, disease, or poison rather than merely suppressing it for 1 hour.
