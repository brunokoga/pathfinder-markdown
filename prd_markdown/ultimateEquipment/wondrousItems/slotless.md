# Slotless Wondrous Items

These wondrous items do not adhere to a specific slot, and are often carried by a character in a way similar to a potion or wand, worn on some part of the body that doesn't correspond to an item slot, or are otherwise utilized in a particular way detailed in the item's description. Slotless wondrous items range through the gamut of appearances and functions, and, generally, if a magic item doesn't fit into any other category it appears here.

Anyone can use slotless wondrous items unless specified otherwise by its description. These wondrous items are usually use-activated or triggered by a command word, but details vary from item to item.

Abjurant Salt

**Price** 600 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Carried in a tube of beaten silver, this rough-ground salt is a powerful defense against evil conjurers. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the salt can be poured in a circle with a diameter of 5 feet or a straight line up to 15 feet long. While the line of salt remains unbroken and undisturbed, evil summoned or called creatures cannot physically cross it or interfere with it. These creatures can continue to make ranged or magical attacks over the line. Any other creature may disturb the line simply by scuffing it. The effects of the salt last as long as the line remains unbroken. Once laid, the salt cannot be recollected.

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

Once per day, an alchemist can use this simple-looking glass vial to combine two extracts into one usable extract as if he had the combine extracts discovery. An _admixture vial_ can combine extracts of 3rd level or lower. Extracts combined with an _admixture vial_ cannot be combined again using this item or the combine extracts discovery.

This gnarled wooden walking stick aids a creature's travel, granting a +5 foot enhancement bonus to speed and a +2 enhancement bonus to CMD against trip attempts and on saving throws to avoid being tripped.

Alluring Golden Apple

**Price** 400 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 4th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This enchanted apple appears to be made of solid gold. When dropped or thrown, it draws the attention of the nearest hostile creature within 20 feet. The creature must make a DC 13 Will save or be paralyzed as if by _ [hold person](spells/holdPerson#_hold-person)_ as it focuses its undivided attention on the golden apple. If the creature makes its save on a later round, it realizes it has been affected by magic and the apple is not actually gold. While focusing on the apple, the target takes a –2 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks. The apple is consumed upon being dropped or thrown.

Anatomy Doll

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child's toy if not for the vital organs depicted on its cloth. By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an _anatomy doll _cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood.

Animated Portrait

**Price** 500 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 10 lbs.

This 4-foot-by-6-foot framed painting is a detailed portrait of a particular intelligent creature, animated to show movement or action within the painted scene. The image reacts when questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer and responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with no actual intelligence, but is programmed with up to ten 25-word verbal responses and can respond to questions if these responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the programmed responses is the name of the person shown in the portrait, it can answer questions such as "who are you?" and "what is your name?" If the item crafter is familiar with or has the cooperation of the creature depicted in the painting, the illusory image has the voice and mannerisms of that creature.

Apparatus of the Crab

**Price** 90,000 gp; **Aura** strong evocation and transmutation; **CL** 19th; **Weight** 00 lbs.

An _apparatus of the crab_ is a metallic magical vehicle. When unoccupied, it appears to be a large, sealed iron barrel big enough to hold two Medium creatures. Close examination, and a DC 20 [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) check, reveals a secret catch that opens a hatch at one end. Anyone who crawls inside finds 10 (unlabeled) levers and seating for two Medium or Small occupants. These levers allow those inside to activate and control the apparatus's movements and actions.

| Lever (1d10) | Lever Function |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Extend/retract legs and tail |
| 2 | Uncover/cover forward porthole |
| 3 | Uncover/cover side portholes |
| 4 | Extend/retract pincers and feelers |

| 7 | Turn left/right |
| 8 | Open/close "eyes" with _continual flame_ inside |
| 9 | Rise/sink in water |
| 10 | Open/close hatch |

Operating a lever is a full-round action, and no lever may be operated more than once per round. However, since two characters can fit inside, the apparatus can move and attack in the same round. The device can function in water up to 900 feet deep. It holds enough air for a crew of two to survive 1d4+1 hours (twice as long for a single occupant).

When active, an _apparatus of the crab_ has the following characteristics: **hp** 200; **hardness** 15; **Speed** 20 ft., swim 20 ft.; **AC** 20 (–1 size, +11 natural); **Melee** 2 pincers +12 (2d8); **CMB** +14; **CMD** 24.

Apple of Eternal Sleep

**Price** 2,500 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This ripe red apple looks fresh and delicious. Should anyone bite into it (even a small taste), he must make an immediate DC 19 Will saving throw or fall into an eternal slumber as though by the witch's grand hex of the same name. The victim can only be awakened by a casting of _ [break enchantment](spells/breakEnchantment#_break-enchantment)_, _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish#_limited-wish)_, _ [wish](spells/wish#_wish)_, or _ [miracle](spells/miracle#_miracle)_, or by a kiss from someone of royal blood.

Archon's Torch

**Price** 750 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This torch is made of pale yellow wood and inscribed with holy runes. When lit, it burns as a regular torch, but only lasts for 5 minutes. When held by a lawful good creature, it functions as an _ [archon's aura](ultimateMagic/spells/archonSAura#_archon's-aura)_ spell. The magical aura ends if a lawful good creature isn't holding it, and resumes automatically if a lawful good creature holds it again.

Arrow Magnet

**Price** 600 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

This tiny silver cube is activated by throwing it at an intersection of squares within 50 feet. The cube hovers 5 feet above the ground at that location for the next 5 rounds. Any small projectile or thrown weapon (such as arrows, shuriken, vials, and bullets) that passes through the squares adjacent to the cube automatically turn in midair to hit the cube (no attack roll needed) instead of their intended target. The cube has 5 hit points and hardness 8. If the _arrow magnet_ is touched by a creature or reduced to 0 hit points or less, it falls to the ground and is destroyed.

Bag of Holding

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 15+ lbs.

This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The _bag of holding_ opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.

| Bag | Bag Weight | Contents Limit | Contents Volume Limit | Price |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Type I | 15 lbs. | 250 lbs. | 30 cubic ft. | 2,500 gp |
| Type II | 25 lbs. | 500 lbs. | 70 cubic ft. | 5,000 gp |
| Type III | 35 lbs. | 1,000 lbs. | 150 cubic ft. | 7,400 gp |
| Type IV | 60 lbs. | 1,500 lbs. | 250 cubic ft. | 10,000 gp |

If a _bag of holding_ is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a _bag of holding_ is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a _bag of holding_ is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.

If a _bag of holding_ is placed within a _portable hole_, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in the space: bag and hole alike are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a _portable hole_ is placed within a _bag of holding_, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane: the hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, destroying the _portable hole_ and _bag of holding_ in the process.

Bag of Tricks

**Price** Varies; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Gray** 3,400 gp; **Rust** 8,500 gp; **Tan** 16,000 gp

This small sack looks empty at first glance. Anyone reaching into the bag feels a small, fuzzy ball inside. If the ball is removed and tossed up to 20 feet away, it turns into an animal. The animal serves the character who drew it from the bag for 10 minutes (or until slain or ordered back into the bag), at which point it disappears. It can follow any of the commands described in the [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) skill. Each of the three kinds of bags of tricks produces a different set of animals. Use the following tables to determine what animals can be drawn out of each.

| Gray Bag  
d% Animal | Rust Bag  
d% Animal | Tan Bag  
d% Animal |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01–30 | Bat | 01–30 | Wolverine | 01–30 | Grizzly bear |
| 31–60 | Rat | 31–60 | Wolf | 31–60 | Lion |
| 61–75 | Cat | 61–85 | Boar | 61–80 | Heavy horse |
| 76–90 | Weasel | 86–100 | Leopard | 81–90 | Tiger |
| 91–100 | Riding dog | | 91–100 | Rhinoceros |

The heavy horse and the riding dog appear with harness and tack, and each accepts the character who drew it from the bag as a rider.

Animals produced are always random, and only one may exist at a time. Up to 10 animals can be drawn from the bag each week, but no more than two per day.

Balm of Impish Grace

**Price** 7,500 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

When rubbed vigorously into the skin, this potent red liniment enhances a Tiny or smaller creature's ability to make full use of its size and mobility. Applying a dose of liniment is a standard action that provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to applying an oil). A creature under the effects of the liniment no longer provokes attacks of opportunity for moving through threatened squares or for entering a larger creature's square. The balm lasts for 5 minutes before its effects wear off. A newly created bottle of balm holds 5 doses.

Bead of Force

**Price** 3,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A _bead of force_ can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.

Once thrown, a _bead of force_ functions like a _ [resilient sphere](spells/resilientSphere#_resilient-sphere)_ spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses the targeted creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a _ [rod of cancellation](magicItems/rods#_rod-of-cancellation)_, a _ [rod of negation](magicItems/rods#_rod-of-negation)_, _ [disintegrate](spells/disintegrate#_disintegrate)_, or a targeted _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_ spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within. The explosion completely consumes the bead, making this a one-use item.

This bead is carved with a tiny pictogram representing a small, harmless animal such as a newt, rabbit, or frog. If the bearer fails a saving throw against a hostile polymorph effect such as _ [baleful polymorph](spells/balefulPolymorph#_baleful-polymorph)_, the bead is destroyed and the effect does not affect the bearer.

Beast-bond Brand

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This sticky henna paste is used to stamp a rust-colored handprint onto the body of a familiar or animal companion, and a hoof, claw, or paw print from that creature onto its master. These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the _beast-bond [brand](advanced/spells/brand#_brand)_ for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied _beast-bond [brand](advanced/spells/brand#_brand)_ has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply).

A character may have only one creature marked in this way at any time. The brand lasts until all charges are expended or the master marks another companion in this way.

Black Soul Shard

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the _black soul shard_ absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The _black soul shard_ can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to. If an attuned _black soul shard _is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death.

Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a _black soul shard_. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again. A creature can only have one _black soul shard_ attuned to it at a time.

Blood Reservoir of Physical Prowess

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

This blown-glass vial has a chain for attaching it to the handle of a weapon. When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time.

The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used.

The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used. This bonus lasts until the end of the wearer's next turn.

The bearer can only use the reservoir if it is held in hand or attached to a held or wielded weapon. A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact. A reservoir has no effect if not charged with the wearer's blood, and cannot be charged by bloodless creatures or those that cannot take Constitution damage.

Bone Razor

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This jagged bone knife seems too thin and frail for combat but easily cuts flesh. If used to perform a coup de grace on a helpless living creature and the creature dies from the attack, the creature's flesh begins to peel off and its bones animate as a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor. The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses the razor to flense and animate another creature's bones, the previous animate skeleton is immediately destroyed.

This leather-bound book is inscribed with runes relating to outsiders and conjuration magic. It enhances spells that summon monsters. The user may apply the [Extend Spell](feats#_extend-spell) feat to these spells as they are cast. This does not change the spell slot of the altered spell. The book counts as a _metamagic rod_ for the purpose of combining multiple metamagic effects on a spell. A normal _book of extended summoning_ can be used with spells of 6th level or lower, while a lesser book can be used with spells of 3rd level or lower, and a greater book can be used with spells of 9th level or lower. Each book is keyed to a particular alignment (equal chances of chaotic, evil, good, or lawful) and only works when used to summon a creature with that alignment. Once the book is used, it crumbles into cold ash and is destroyed.

This multicolored, sturdy glass bead is an aid to members of the alchemist class. Once per day on command, a _boro bead_ enables the bearer to recharge any one extract that he had mixed and then consumed that day. The extract is then reconstituted and usable again, just as if it had not been drank. The extract must be of a particular level, depending on the bead. Different beads exist for recalling one extract per day of each level from 1st through 6th. A bead works on an infusion, but not a potion, elixir, bomb, mutagen, or nonmagical alchemical material such as antitoxin.

Bottle of Air

**Price** 7,250 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment, it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.

Bottle of Messages

**Price** 300 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the bottle speaks into the bottle during this time (up to 25 words) gets trapped inside it once the cork fully manifests. As soon as the cork is removed or the bottle is smashed, this message is released exactly as if the owner had spoken the words at that moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.

This bottle is crafted from the darkest ebony. When opened and held upright, faint whispers can be heard emanating from the bottle's mouth. The bottle initially has 4 charges. When turned upside down, the bottle summons a shadow to do the bidding of the user, draining 1 charge each round of service. As a standard action, the bearer may dismiss the summoned shadow. If the shadow kills a humanoid creature of at least 4 HD, the bottle gains 1 charge. The bottle is automatically restored to 4 charges at sundown.

Bottled Misfortune

**Price** 500 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green liquid. As a full-round action, a witch can target the bottle with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid.

The surface of this stick of white chalk is covered with silvery runes. Drawing a line with the chalk creates a _ [wall of force](spells/wallOfForce#_wall-of-force)_ that is as long as the line and extends 10 feet perpendicular to the surface on which the line was drawn. Drawing a 5-foot line is a standard action that provokes acts of opportunity. Each wall lasts 10 minutes; the bearer of the chalk can dismiss a section of wall as a swift action by touching the stick of chalk to it. One stick of _boundary chalk_ can draw 100 feet of line before it is used up, and it must be used in 5-foot increments.

This clean-smelling white candle is inscribed with glyphs portraying various sweet smelling flowers. When lit, the candle repels smoke, mist, cloud, and other gas effects in a 5-foot radius. These effects do not penetrate the area around the candle if they are of spell level 3 or lower. Against more powerful cloud effects (including effects not based on spells, such as dragon breath or a gorgon's breath weapon), the candle grants creatures in the area a +4 resistance bonus on saving throws against these effects. Creatures in the area gain a +4 deflection bonus to AC against attacks from creatures with the air subtype.

The candle burns for up to 5 minutes, in increments of 1 minute. Once all 5 minutes are used, the candle is destroyed.

Candle of Invocation

**Price** 8,400 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Each of these special tapers is dedicated to one of the nine alignments. Simply burning the candle generates a favorable aura for the individual if the candle's alignment matches that of the character. Characters of the same alignment as the burning candle add a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saving throws, and skill checks while within 30 feet of the flame.

A cleric whose alignment matches the candle's operates as if two levels higher for purposes of determining spells per day if he burns the candle during or just prior to his spell preparation time. He can even cast spells normally unavailable to him as if he were of that higher level, but only so long as the candle continues to burn. Except in special cases (see below), a candle burns for 4 hours. It is possible to extinguish the candle simply by blowing it out, so users often place it in a lantern to protect it from drafts and the like. Doing this doesn't interfere with its magical properties.

In addition, burning a candle also allows the owner to cast a _ [gate](spells/gate#_gate)_ spell, the respondent being of the same alignment as the candle, but the taper is immediately consumed in the process.

Cape of Bravado

This bright red garment bestows no benefit when worn on the shoulders, but when held in one hand while draped over the arm, the cape obscures its user's movements in combat. Used this way, the cape bestows a +1 insight bonus to AC and a +5 competence bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff#_bluff) checks to feint in combat. Readying the cape in combat is a move action; if the wielder has a base attack bonus of +1 or higher, the wielder can ready the cape as a free action as part of movement.

Once per day as an immediate action, a creature brandishing a _cape of bravado _may attempt to compel an opponent within 30 feet to attack him on its next turn (Will negates DC 11).

This rug is able to fly through the air as if affected by an _ [overland flight](spells/overlandFlight#_overland-flight)_ spell of unlimited duration. The size, carrying capacity, and speed of the different _carpets of flying_ are shown on the table below. Beautifully and intricately made, each carpet has its own command word to activate it—if the device is within voice range, the command word activates it, whether the speaker is on the rug or not. The carpet is then controlled by spoken directions.

| Size | Capacity | Speed | Weight | Price |

| 10-ft.-by-10-ft. | 800 lbs. | 40 ft. | 15 lbs. | 60,000 gp |

A _carpet of flying_ can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. A _carpet of flying_ can hover without making a [Fly](skills/fly#_fly) skill check and gives a +5 bonus to other [Fly](skills/fly#_fly) checks.

The cauldron moves under the direction of the person who spoke the activating command word. It can carry up to double its capacity, but doing so reduces its speed to 30 feet. It can hover in place without the need for a [Fly](skills/fly#_fly) skill check. The cauldron provides partial cover for anyone standing in it. It has a hardness of 10 and 60 hit points.

The spell effect depends on the components used: _ [raise dead](spells/raiseDead#_raise-dead)_ costs 5,000 gp worth of materials, while _ [resurrection](spells/resurrection#_resurrection)_ costs 10,000 gp worth of materials.

This cauldron of dark iron is large enough to accommodate a single Medium creature. When filled with a mixture of water and rare herbs, the cauldron transforms any dead body placed in it into a zombie as if animated by an animate dead spell. Each corpse animated uses up 25 gp in materials per Hit Die, and the cauldron can animate one corpse per round. The user of the cauldron commands the undead so created—up to 12 HD worth, unless the user can cast the animate dead spell, in which case that spell's limit is used; animating more beyond this limit causes earlier specimens to become uncontrolled.

This slim leather leash is just over 100 feet long, incredibly light, and uncannily strong, making it an excellent tool for training birds of prey and other flying predators. It grants a +4 circumstance bonus on any [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal#_handle-animal) check made to train such animals. When used to bind a flying animal companion or familiar to its master, the leash allows the master to cast _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall#_feather-fall)_ on the creature at will. If the master has the share touch spells class ability, once per day he can use that ability on the leashed creature, even if they are not touching. The delivered spell can be no higher than 3rd level. The creance attaches to the master's forearm; attack rolls and skill checks made with that arm take a –1 penalty.

Chalice of Poison Weeping

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This silver chalice has stylized representations of rearing unicorns serving as handles. The bearer of the chalice can expel toxins from a poisoned creature's body, causing the target to weep the poison from its eyes and allowing the bearer to collect it in the chalice. This functions as _ [neutralize poison](spells/neutralizePoison#_neutralize-poison)_ on the target, eliminating that poison. If the target is immune to poison or the poison has run its course, the chalice has no effect. If the poison normally has a solid or liquid form, it collects as a single dose of the poison in the cup (regardless of how many times the target was poisoned). The collected poison has all the normal effects of the original poison, except its DC is 4 lower, and can be stored in another container or used like any other poison. The chalice can be used once per day.

- _ [chaos hammer](spells/chaosHammer#_chaos-hammer)_ (2 charges)

A newly created _chaos emerald_ has 1d6+2 charges. It can hold a maximum of 10 charges and automatically regains 1d3–1 charges each day.

A non-chaotic creature who holds or carries a _chaos emerald_ gains one negative level.

Chime of Interruption

**Price** 16,800 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This instrument can be struck once every 10 minutes, and its resonant tone lasts for 3 full minutes.

Chime of Opening

**Price** 3,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** 1 lb.

A _chime of opening_ is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A _chime of opening_ also automatically dispels a _ [hold portal](spells/holdPortal#_hold-portal)_ spell or even an _ [arcane lock](spells/arcaneLock#_arcane-lock)_ cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.

The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a _chime of opening_ to get it open. A _ [silence](spells/silence#_silence)_ spell negates the power of the device. A brand-new chime can be used a total of 10 times before it cracks and becomes useless.

Chime of Resounding Silence

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This foot-long tube of gold absorbs nearby sound when struck, as if it were the target of a _ [silence](spells/silence#_silence)_ spell. This ability can be used once per day. The chime vibrates silently for the next 5 rounds, increasing in strength as time passes. On the bearer's turn each round there is a cumulative 20% chance that the chime prematurely ends the magical silence and releases the pent-up sound as a _ [shout](spells/shout#_shout)_ spell as a free action, oriented in a random direction. The bearer may spend a standard action to strike the vibrating chime again, ending its _ [silence](spells/silence#_silence)_ early and unleashing the _ [shout](spells/shout#_shout)_ in a direction of his choosing. If dropped while vibrating, the chime automatically gains the broken condition and releases the _ [shout](spells/shout#_shout)_ effect in a random direction. A broken _chime of resounding [silence](spells/silence#_silence) _cannot be used until it is repaired. The chime has no effect if struck in an area of _ [silence](spells/silence#_silence)_ it did not create.

Four command words determine what sorts of sounds it is to play (battle, fire, massacre, or riot), and a fifth determines the delay (anywhere from 1 round to 20 minutes) until the box begins to produce the desired sound. The noise from the box is as loud as 40 people. The sound persists for 2d6 rounds.

If a human, half-elf, or half-orc flips the coin and catches it, she takes a –2 penalty to the ability score modified by her +2 racial ability score bonus, but gains a +2 inherent bonus to a random other ability score. The bonus and penalty last for 1 hour. Negating the penalty automatically negates the bonus as well. The coin can be used three times per day.

Concealing Pocket

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

This 4-inch-square cloth pocket has no powers unless it is sewn onto a garment (which takes 1d4 minutes). Once sewn, it changes its appearance to match the garment. Any magic item inside it cannot be magically detected, as if protected by _ [magic aura](spells/magicAura#_magic-aura)_. Hiding an item in the pocket gives the garment's wearer a +5 competence bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) checks to conceal the item. The pocket can be removed from the garment with a DC 10 [Heal](skills/heal#_heal) check or an appropriate [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) check such as [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (cloth) or [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (leather); failing this roll by 5 or more gives the pocket the broken condition.

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 7 lbs.

This is the most common form of scrying device, a crystal sphere about 6 inches in diameter. So well-known are these items that many so-called oracles or fortune-tellers use similar appearing (but completely non-magical) replicas of these items to ply their trades. A character can use a magical crystal ball to see over virtually any distance or into other planes of existence, as with the spell _ [scrying](spells/scrying#_scrying)_ (Will DC 16 negates). A crystal ball can be used multiple times per day, but the DC to resist its power decreases by 1 for each additional use.

Certain crystal balls have additional powers that can be used through the crystal ball on the target viewed.

Cube of Force

**Price** 62,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This device is just under an inch across and can be made of ivory, bone, or any hard mineral. Typically, each of the cube's faces are polished smooth, but sometimes they are etched with runes. The device enables its possessor to put up a special cube made up of 6 individual _ [wall of force](spells/wallOfForce#_wall-of-force)_ spells, 10 feet on a side around her person. This cubic screen moves with the character and is impervious to the attack forms mentioned on the table below. The cube has 36 charges when fully charged—charges used are automatically renewed each day. The possessor presses one face of the cube to activate a particular type of screen or to deactivate the device. Each effect costs a certain number of charges to maintain for every minute (or portion of a minute) it is in operation. Also, when an effect is active, the possessor's speed is limited to the maximum value given on the following table.

When the _cube of force _is active, attacks dealing more than 30 points of damage to a wall drain 1 charge for every 10 points of damage beyond 30 that they deal. The charge cost to maintain each of the cube's six walls is summarized below.

 Cube Face | Charge Cost per Minute | Max. Speed | Effect || 1 | 1 | 30 ft. | Keeps out gases, wind, etc. |
| 2 | 2 | 20 ft. | Keeps out nonliving matter |
| 3 | 3 | 15 ft. | Keeps out living matter |
| 4 | 4 | 10 ft. | Keeps out magic |
| 5 | 6 | 10 ft. | Keeps out all things |
| 6 | 0 | As normal | Deactivates |

Spells that affect the integrity of the screen also drain extra charges. These spells cannot be cast into or out of the cube.

| Attack Form | Extra Charges |

| _ [Disintegrate](spells/disintegrate#_disintegrate)_ | 6 |

Cube of Frost Resistance

**Price** 27,000 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This cube is activated or deactivated by pressing one side. When activated, it creates a cube-shaped area 10 feet on a side centered on the possessor (or on the cube itself, if the item is later placed on a surface). The temperature within this area is always at least 65° F. The field absorbs all cold-based attacks. However, if the field is subjected to more than 50 points of cold damage in 1 round (from one or multiple attacks), it collapses and cannot be reactivated for 1 hour. If the field absorbs more than 100 points of cold damage in a 10-round period, the cube is destroyed.

Cubic Gate

**Price** 164,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This potent magical item is a small cube fashioned from carnelian. Each of the six sides of the cube is keyed to a different plane of existence or dimension, one of which is the Material Plane. The character creating the item chooses the planes to which the other five sides are keyed.

If a side of the _cubic gate_ is pressed once, it opens a gate to a random point on the plane keyed to that side. There is a 10% chance per minute that an outsider from that plane (determine randomly) comes through it looking for food, fun, or trouble. Pressing the side a second time closes the gate. It is impossible to open more than one gate at a time.

If a side is pressed twice in quick succession, the character so doing is transported to a random point on the other plane, along with all creatures in adjacent squares. The other creatures may avoid this fate by succeeding on DC 23 Will saves.

Darkskull

**Price** 60,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation [evil]; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This skull, carved from ebony, is wholly evil. Wherever the skull goes, the area around it is treated as though an _ [unhallow](spells/unhallow#_unhallow)_ spell had been cast with the skull as the touched point of origin. Each _darkskull_ has a single spell effect tied to it. This spell is from the standard list given in the _ [unhallow](spells/unhallow#_unhallow)_ spell description, and it cannot be changed.

Decanter of Endless Water

**Price** 9,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

If the stopper is removed from this ordinary-looking flask and a command word spoken, an amount of fresh or salt water pours out. Separate command words determine the type of water as well as the volume and velocity.

- "Stream" pours out 1 gallon per round.
- "Fountain" produces a 5-foot-long stream at 5 gallons per round.
- "Geyser" produces a 20-foot-long, 1-foot-wide stream at 30 gallons per round.

The geyser effect exerts considerable pressure, requiring the holder to make a DC 12 Strength check to avoid being knocked down each round the effect is maintained. In addition, the powerful force of the geyser deals 1d4 points of damage per round to a creature that is subjected to it. The geyser can only affect one target per round, but the user can direct the beam of water without needing to make an attack role to strike the target since the geyser's constant flow allows for ample opportunity to aim. Creatures with the fire subtype take 2d4 points of damage per round from the geyser rather than 1d4. The command word must be spoken to stop it.

Deck of Illusions

**Price** 8,100 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This set of parchment cards is usually found in an ivory, leather, or wooden box. A full deck consists of 34 cards. When a card is drawn at random and thrown to the ground, a _ [major image](spells/majorImage#_major-image)_ of a creature is formed. The figment lasts until dispelled. The illusory creature cannot move more than 30 feet away from where the card landed, but otherwise moves and acts as if it were real. At all times it obeys the desires of the character who drew the card. When the illusion is dispelled, the card becomes blank and cannot be used again. If the card is picked up, the illusion is automatically and instantly dispelled. The cards in a deck and the illusions they bring forth are summarized on the following table. (Use one of the first two columns to simulate the contents of a full deck using either ordinary playing cards or tarot cards.)

Defoliant Polish

**Price** 800 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by _defoliant polish_ with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack or each round they maintain the grapple.

Made from bone and sun-dried sinew, this masterwork harp produces a vague sense of unease in anyone near it. If the owner of this item has the bardic performance class feature he can use it to perform a dirge of doom even if he is not of sufficient level to normally have access to that ability. A bard who can use dirge of doom and who plays the harp as part of his performance increases the effective radius to 60 feet.

The thick liquid in this ceramic jar smells sickly sweet. To activate its powers, the user it must be unstopper the jar as a standard action while thinking deeply about a specific person or object that she has seen at least once from up to 30 feet away. When then poured onto the ground, the syrup flows at 15 feet per round following the most direct route to the creature or object visualized, provided the creature or object is on the same plane, leaving behind a sticky trail. The syrup can flow uphill or even up stairs and can pass through openings as narrow as one-sixteenth of an inch. It cannot penetrate other liquids or porous or absorbent surfaces (such as sand or sawdust).

Dragonbone Divination Sticks

**Price** 6,400 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

These eight rune-engraved dragon bones may be used as a divine focus for augury. They add 5% to the chance to successfully cast _ [augury](spells/augury#_augury)_ and _ [divination](spells/divination#_divination)_. The bearer of the set gains a +3 luck bonus on one type of saving throw (Fortitude, Reflex, or Will), determined randomly each day.

Drinking Horn of Bottomless Valor

**Price** 24,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges—charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits:

_1 charge_: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an _ [aid](spells/aid#_aid)_ spell), which last for 1 minute.

_2 charges_: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell _ [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson#_enlarge-person)_, for 5 minutes.

_3 charges_: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a _ [heroism](spells/heroism#_heroism)_ spell for as long as she is enlarged.

A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion—it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn.

When played, this sturdy snare drum increases the run speed of allied creatures within 120 feet as if they had the [Run](feats#_run) feat. Activating the drum is a standard action that requires a DC 20 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (percussion) check; maintaining the playing is a free action if the player is running. If the bearer stops playing the drum, the enhanced running speed ends. The drum may be used for up to 1 hour per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but must be used in 10-minute increments.

These drums are kettle drums (hemispheres about 1-1/2 feet in diameter on stands). They come in pairs and are unremarkable in appearance. If both of the pair are sounded, all creatures within 120 feet (with the exception of those within a 20-foot-radius safe zone around the drums) are affected as by a _ [fear](spells/fear#_fear)_ spell (Will DC 16 partial). _Drums of panic_ can be used once per day.

Dry Load Powder Horn

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the _dry load powder horn_, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.

Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When a shot loaded from a _dry load powder horn_ results in a firearm explosion while underwater or in an airless environment, that explosion occurs normally.

Dust of Acid Consumption

**Price** 1,600 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This brown dust is similar to _dust of dryness_, but affects acid rather than water and absorbs less liquid. If it is thrown into acid, a volume of as much as 10 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble sized pellet floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per gallon absorbed into the pellet (maximum 4d6), affecting all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its point of impact. This is a splash weapon.

If the dust is used against an ooze that deals acid damage with its attacks, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the ooze even if its saving throw succeeds.

Dust of Appearance

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This powder appears to be a very fine, very light metallic dust. A single handful of this substance flung into the air coats objects within a 10-foot radius, making them visible even if they are invisible. It likewise negates the effects of _ [blur](spells/blur#_blur)_ and _ [displacement](spells/displacement#_displacement)_. In this, it works just like the _ [faerie fire](spells/faerieFire#_faerie-fire)_ spell. The dust also reveals figments, mirror images, and projected images for what they are. A creature coated with the dust takes a –30 penalty on its [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks. The dust's effect lasts for 5 minutes.

_Dust of appearance_ is typically stored in small silk packets or hollow bone tubes.

Dust of Darkness

**Price** 600 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

This shimmering black dust causes one creature to be coated in a layer of darkness for 1 minute. In normal light, the creature gains concealment (20% miss chance). In dim light, the creature gains total concealment (50% miss chance). It has no effect in areas of bright light or darkness (though in bright light, a viewer can make a DC 20 [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) check to notice the target is slightly shadowed). Creatures with darkvision see through the dust's darkness as if it were normal darkness. The dust dispels and counters the outlining effects of _ [glitterdust](spells/glitterdust#_glitterdust)_, but doesn't affect the spell's blinding effects. _ [Glitterdust](spells/glitterdust#_glitterdust)_ dispels and counters the effects of the _dust of [darkness](spells/darkness#_darkness)_.

Dust of Disappearance

**Price** 3,500 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This dust looks like _dust of appearance_ and is typically stored in the same manner. A creature or object touched by it becomes invisible (as _ [greater invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility-greater)_). Normal vision can't see dusted creatures or objects, nor can they be detected by magical means, including _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility#_see-invisibility)_ or _ [invisibility purge](spells/invisibilityPurge#_invisibility-purge)_. _Dust of appearance_, however, does reveal people and objects made invisible by _dust of disappearance_. Other factors, such as sound and smell, also allow possible detection. The _ [greater invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility-greater)_ bestowed by the dust lasts for 2d6 rounds. The invisible creature doesn't know when the duration will end.

This special dust has many uses. If it is thrown into water, a volume of as much as 100 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble-sized pellet, floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of water. The dust affects only water (fresh, salt, alkaline), not other liquids.

If the dust is employed against an outsider with the elemental and water subtypes, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the creature even if its saving throw succeeds.

A creature coated with this glittering golden dust can interact with any one item or object as if she had successfully used the [Use Magic Device](skills/useMagicDevice#_use-magic-device) skill to emulate a class feature or race (if the exact result of the check matters, treat the character's result as a 25). If the user of the dust does not mentally select the intended item or object while coating herself with the dust, the magic of the dust applies to the first eligible object she encounters. She can apply the result of this automatic check when dealing with the item or object for 1 hour after exposure to the dust.

This unremarkable powder resembles chalk dust or powdered graphite. When stared at, however, the dust changes color and form. A creature covered in _dust of illusion _is affected as if by a _ [disguise self](spells/disguiseSelf#_disguise-self)_ glamer, with the individual who sprinkles the dust envisioning the illusion desired. An unwilling target is allowed a DC 11 Reflex save to avoid the dust. The glamer lasts for 2 hours.

Dust of Tracelessness

This normal-seeming dust is actually a magic powder that can conceal the passage of its possessor and his companions. Tossing a handful of this dust into the air causes a chamber of up to 100 square feet of floor space to become as dusty, dirty, and cobweb-laden as if it had been abandoned and disused for a decade.

A handful of dust sprinkled along a trail causes evidence of the passage of as many as a dozen humanoids and horses to be obliterated for 250 feet back into the distance. The results of the dust are instantaneous, and no magical aura lingers afterward from this use of the dust. [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) checks made to track a quarry across an area affected by this dust have a DC 20 higher than normal.

Dust Of Weighty Burdens

**Price** 3,600 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

Also known as lodestone essence, this coarse gray powder comes in a fragile ceramic flask covered in Terran runes. A newly-crafted flask contains enough powder for 10 applications if poured out carefully, or the whole container can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet.

One application of the dust sprinkled over an object increases the target's weight by 100 pounds. Multiple applications stack, and the effect remains until the object is scrubbed clean of the metallic particles (taking a full-round action per application) or it takes 5 points of electricity damage per application.

A creature struck directly with a thrown flask must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per application remaining in the flask) or gain heavy encumbrance and be unable to fly for 2d4 rounds. Targets in the splash area must save or gain medium encumbrance for 2d4 rounds. Scrubbing or electricity damage neutralizes the thrown powder as noted above.

This appears to be a typical arrow container capable of holding about 20 arrows. It has three distinct portions, each with a nondimensional space allowing it to store far more than would normally be possible. The first and smallest one can contain up to 60 objects of the same general size and shape as an arrow. The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard.

This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01–10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91–100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11–90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.

**Price** 2,250 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

An _elemental gem_ comes in one of four different varieties. Each contains a conjuration spell attuned to a specific elemental plane (Air, Earth, Fire, or Water).

When the gem is crushed, smashed, or broken (a standard action), a Large elemental appears as if summoned by a _summon nature's ally_ spell. The elemental is under the control of the creature that broke the gem.

The coloration of the gem varies with the type of elemental it summons. _Air elemental gems_ are transparent, _earth elemental gems_ are light brown, _fire elemental gems_ are reddish orange, and _water elemental gems_ are blue-green.

Elixir of Dragon Breath

**Price** 1,400 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This gurgling, luminescent elixir comes in several different varieties, each keyed to a particular type of metallic or chromatic dragon. A creature that drinks the elixir can, as a standard action, breathe out a single blast of energy similar to a dragon's breath weapon, dealing 7d6 points of energy damage. Creatures in the area may attempt a DC 16 Reflex save for half damage. The magic of the elixir ends after one use of the breath weapon or after 1 hour has passed, whichever comes first. The type of energy produced and the shape of the blast are determined by the elixir's associated dragon type:

_Black or copper dragon_: 30-foot line of acid.

_Blue or bronze dragon_: 30-foot line of electricity.

_Brass dragon_: 30-foot line of fire.

_Green dragon_: 15-foot cone of acid.

_Gold or red dragon_: 15-foot cone of fire.

Elixir of Truth

**Price** 500 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This elixir forces the drinker to say nothing but the truth for 10 minutes (Will DC 13 negates). She must answer any questions put to her in that time, but with each question she can make a separate DC 13 Will save. If one of these secondary saves is successful, she doesn't break free of the truth-compelling enchantment but also doesn't have to answer that particular question (if she does answer, she must tell the truth). No more than one question can be asked each round. This is a mind-affecting compulsion enchantment.

Embalming Thread

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This coarse, acrid-smelling thread is more akin to wire than fabric. When carefully sewn into the body of a flesh golem or zombie (requiring 1 hour per Hit Die of the creature and a successful DC 20 [Heal](skills/heal#_heal) or [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check), the stitches change the creature's damage reduction to DR 5/adamantine and slashing. Variant zombies lacking damage reduction (such as fast zombies) instead gain DR 5/slashing. One length of stitching is required for every Hit Die of the creature being enhanced. Using an insufficient number of lengths has no effect. A full thimble of _embalming thread_ contains 20 lengths.

If the skill check to use the stitches fails, they are not wasted, but must first be cleaned and unknotted, requiring 1 hour per stitch. Once used successfully, the stitches cannot be reused.

Enmity Fetish

**Price** 40,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This small talisman is comprised of teeth, fingers, ears, or other grotesque trophies taken from the freshly dead. Each talisman is imbued with an intense animosity toward a particular type of creature, chosen from the ranger favored enemy list when the fetish is created. Once per day, the talisman can impart this animosity to a ranger (or other character with the favored enemy class feature), replacing one of his favored enemies with the fetish's designated creature type. This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).

Escape Ladder

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This 10-foot long rope ladder unrolls itself on command, extending upward into the air and magically holding itself in place. The ends of each rope have small loops for tying to another rope, a grappling hook, a piton, or similar fixtures. A second command word makes the ladder roll itself again, pulling itself toward whichever end the speaker is touching. Climbing the ladder is a DC 0 [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) check. The ladder can hold up to 300 pounds if holding itself in the air, or 600 pounds if attached to a sturdy surface.

A third command word creates an extradimensional space at the top of the ladder that is identical to _ [rope trick](spells/ropeTrick#_rope-trick)_, except it only holds up to one Medium creature and has a very short duration. When a creature enters the extradimensional space, at the end of the creature's turn the space collapses and the creature is transported as though by _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door)_ 1d6 × 100 feet away in a random direction to a safe, ground-level location. The ladder remains behind and falls to the ground when this power is used. The third command word may be used once per day.

Eversmoking Bottle

**Price** 5,400 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This metal urn is identical in appearance to an _efreeti bottle_, except that it does nothing but smoke. The amount of smoke is great if the stopper is pulled out, pouring from the bottle and totally obscuring vision across a 50-foot spread in 1 round. If the bottle is left unstoppered, the smoke billows out another 10 feet per round until it has covered a 100-foot radius. This area remains smoke-filled until the _eversmoking bottle_ is stoppered.

The bottle must be resealed by a command word, after which the smoke dissipates normally. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the smoke in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the smoke in 1 round.

This short aspergillum is made of silver. An inquisitor who carries it may use _ [detect undead](spells/detectUndead#_detect-undead)_ as if it were one of the spells associated with her detect alignment ability. Once per day, the item can alter an inquisitor's judgment ability; by spending one use of her judgment ability, she can allow her spells of 3rd level and lower to have full effect against incorporeal creatures, as though using the [Ectoplasmic Spell](advanced/advancedFeats#_ectoplasmic-spell) feat. This lasts until the combat ends.

Eye of the Void

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

The _eye of the void_ normally appears to be a small black glass or crystal ball 3 to 4 inches in diameter. However, when commanded to open, the eye reveals itself as the terrifying, multi-pupilled eye of some abomination from the dark spaces between the stars. Once per day, the bearer may hold the eye and speak one of two command words to open the eye. The first word creates a gaze effect in a 30-foot cone. The second word creates a gaze effect in a 15-foot sphere. Each creature subject to the gaze must make a DC 16 Will save; success means the creature is shaken for 1 minute, failure means it becomes frightened for 1 minute and takes 1d6 points of Wisdom damage. This is a mind-affecting fear effect.

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon with a full-round action. A firearm wielder can choose to spend a full-round action to make a single shot with a firearm that has this sight. When she does, she can resolve the attack against the touch AC of her target regardless of the range increment.

Feather Token

**Price** Varies; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

**Anchor** 50 gp; **Bird** 300 gp; **Fan** 200 gp; **Swan boat** 450 gp; **Tree** 400 gp; **Whip** 500 gp

Each of these items is a small feather that has a power to suit a special need. The kinds of tokens are described below. Each token is usable once. A particular _feather token_ has no specific features to identify it unless its magic aura is viewed—even tokens with identical powers can be wildly different in appearance.

_Anchor_: A token that creates an anchor that moors a craft in water so as to render it immobile for up to 1 day.

_Bird_: A token that creates a small bird that can be used to deliver a small written message unerringly to a designated target. The token lasts as long as it takes to carry the message.

_Fan_: A token that forms a huge flapping fan, causing a breeze of sufficient strength to propel one ship (about 25 mph). This wind is not cumulative with existing wind speed. The token can, however, be used to lessen existing winds, creating an area of relative calm or lighter winds (but wave size in a storm is not affected). The fan can be used for up to 8 hours. It does not function on land.

_Swan Boat_: A token that forms a swan-like boat capable of moving on water at a speed of 60 feet. It can carry eight horses and gear, 32 Medium characters, or any equivalent combination. The boat lasts for 1 day.

_Tree_: A token that causes a great oak to spring into being (5-foot-diameter trunk, 60-foot height, 40-foot top diameter). This is an instantaneous effect.

_Whip_: A token that forms into a huge leather whip and wields itself against any opponent desired just like a _ [dancing](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-dancing)_ weapon. The weapon has a +10 base attack bonus, does 1d6+1 points of nonlethal damage, has a +1 enhancement bonus on attack and damage rolls, and a makes a free grapple attack (with a +15 bonus on its combat maneuver checks) if it hits. The whip lasts no longer than 1 hour.

Figurines of Wondrous Power

**Price** Varies; **Aura** varies; **CL** varies; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Bronze griffon** 10,000 gp; **Ebony fly** 10,000 gp; **Golden lions** 16,500 gp; **Ivory goats** 21,000 gp; **Marble elephant** 17,000 gp; **Obsidian steed** 28,500 gp; **Onyx dog** 15,500 gp; **Serpentine owl** 9,100 gp; **Silver raven** 3,800 gp; **Slate spider** 10,000 gp

Each of the several kinds of _figurines of wondrous power_ appears to be a miniature statuette of a creature an inch or so high (with one exception). When the figurine is tossed down and the correct command word spoken, it becomes a living creature of normal size (except when noted otherwise below). The creature obeys and serves its owner. Unless stated otherwise, the creature understands Common but does not speak.

If a _figurine of wondrous power_ is broken or destroyed in its statuette form, it is forever ruined. All magic is lost, its power departed. If slain in animal form, the figurine simply reverts to a statuette that can be used again at a later time.

**Bronze Griffon** : When animated, a bronze griffon acts in all ways like a normal griffon under the command of its possessor. The item can be used twice per week for up to 6 hours per use. When 6 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the bronze griffon once again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Ebony [Fly](skills/fly#_fly)** : When animated, an ebony fly is the size of a pony and has all the statistics of a pegasus but can make no attacks. The item can be used three times per week for up to 12 hours per use. When 12 hours have passed or when the command word is spoken, the ebony fly again becomes a tiny statuette. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Golden Lions** : These figurines come in pairs. They become normal adult male lions. If slain in combat, the lions cannot be brought back from statuette form for 1 full week. Otherwise, they can be used once per day for up to 1 hour. They enlarge and shrink upon speaking the command word. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

- _The Goat of Traveling_: This statuette provides a speedy and enduring mount equal to that of a heavy horse in every way except appearance. The goat can travel for a maximum of 1 day each week—continuously or in any combination of periods totaling 24 hours. At this point, or when the command word is uttered, it returns to its statuette form for no less than 1 day before it can again be used.
- _The Goat of Travail_: This statuette becomes an enormous creature, larger than a bull, with the statistics of a nightmare except for the addition of a pair of wicked horns of exceptional size (damage 1d8+4 for each horn). If it is charging to attack, it may only use its horns (but add 6 points of damage to each successful attack in that round). It can be called to life just once per month for up to 12 hours at a time.
- _The Goat of Terror_: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a _+3 heavy lance_, the other as a _+5 longsword_). When ridden in an attack against an opponent, the goat of terror radiates fear as the spell in a 30-foot radius (Will DC 16 partial). It can be used once every 2 weeks for up to 3 hours per use. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Marble Elephant** : This is the largest of the figurines, the statuette being about the size of a human hand. Upon utterance of the command word, a marble elephant grows to the size and specifications of a true elephant. The animal created from the statuette is fully obedient to the figurine's owner, serving as a beast of burden, a mount, or a combatant. The statuette can be used four times per month for up to 24 hours at a time. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Obsidian Steed** : This figurine appears to be a small, shapeless lump of black stone. Only careful inspection reveals that it vaguely resembles some form of quadruped. On command, the near-formless piece of obsidian becomes a fantastic mount. Treat it as a heavy horse with the following additional powers usable once per round at will: _ [overland flight](spells/overlandFlight#_overland-flight)_, _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift#_plane-shift)_, and _ [ethereal jaunt](spells/etherealJaunt#_ethereal-jaunt)_. The steed allows itself to be ridden, but if the rider is of good alignment, the steed is 10% likely per use to carry him to the lower planes and then return to its statuette form. The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means. Strong conjuration and transmutation; CL 15th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_, _etherealness_, _ [fly](spells/fly)_, _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift#_plane-shift)_.

**Onyx Dog** : When commanded, this statuette changes into a creature with the same properties as a riding dog except that it is endowed with an Intelligence of 8, can communicate in Common, and has exceptional olfactory and visual abilities. It has the scent ability and adds +4 on its [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks. It has 60-foot darkvision, and it can _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility#_see-invisibility)_. An onyx dog can be used once per week for up to 6 hours. It obeys only its owner. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Serpentine Owl** : This figurine becomes either a normal-sized horned owl or a giant owl (use the stats for the giant eagle) according to the command word used. The transformation can take place once per day, with a maximum duration of 8 continuous hours. However, after three transformations into giant owl form, the statuette loses all its magical properties. The owl communicates with its owner by telepathic means, informing her of all it sees and hears. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Silver Raven** : This silver figurine turns into a raven on command (but it retains its metallic consistency, which gives it hardness 10). Another command sends it off into the air, bearing a message just like a creature affected by an _ [animal messenger](spells/animalMessenger#_animal-messenger)_ spell. If not commanded to carry a message, the raven obeys the commands of its owner, although it has no special powers or telepathic abilities. It can maintain its nonfigurine status for only 24 hours per week, but the duration need not be continuous. Moderate enchantment and transmutation; CL 6th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animal messenger](spells/animalMessenger#_animal-messenger)_, _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

**Slate Spider** : This statuette of a spider with stubby legs can be used once per day for 1 minute. When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm. Each time the slate spider cleans a firearm, the next shot the firearm fires has no chance of misfiring. Moderate transmutation; CL 11th; [Craft Wondrous Item](feats#_craft-wondrous-item), _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_.

Folding Boat

**Price** 7,200 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 4 lbs.

A _folding boat_ looks like a small wooden box about 12 inches long, 6 inches wide, and 6 inches deep when it is inactive. In this mode, it can be used to store items just like any other box. Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The _folding boat_ cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.

In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail. In its larger form, the boat has a deck, single rowing seats, five sets of oars, a rudder, an anchor, a deck cabin, and a mast with a square sail. The boat can hold four people comfortably, while the ship carries 15 with ease.

A third word of command causes the boat or ship to fold itself into a box once again, but only when it is unoccupied.

Formula Alembic

**Price** 200 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This magically-augmented alchemical device distills a potion or alchemist extract into the knowledge needed to create its formula. By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid. If consumed by an alchemist, this liquid gives him knowledge of the potion's or extract's formula, as if it were an extract he recorded in his formula book. This knowledge lasts for 24 hours. He may scribe this formula in his formula book in the normal fashion.

Using the alembic does not harm the potion, but the process makes it nearly boiling hot (it cools normally). The alembic can only distill the knowledge of formulas on the alchemist extract list (for example, it cannot turn a potion of a cleric-only spell into something an alchemist can learn).

Gem of Brightness

**Price** 13,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** —

This crystal appears to be a long, rough prism. Upon utterance of a command word, though, the gem's facets suddenly grow highly polished as the crystal emits bright light of one of three sorts.

One command word causes the gem to shed light as a hooded lantern. This use of the gem does not expend any charges, and it continues to emit light until this command word is spoken a second time to extinguish the illumination.

Another command word causes the _gem of brightness_ to send out a bright ray 1 foot in diameter and 50 feet long. This strikes as a ranged touch attack, and any creature struck by this beam is blinded for 1d4 rounds unless it makes a DC 14 Fortitude save. This use of the gem expends 1 charge.

The third command word causes the gem to flare in a blinding flash of light that fills a 30-foot cone. Although this glare lasts but a moment, any creature within the cone must make a DC 14 Fortitude save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds. This use expends 5 charges.

A newly created _gem of brightness_ has 50 charges. When all its charges are expended, the gem becomes nonmagical and its facets grow cloudy with a fine network of cracks.

This finely cut and polished stone is indistinguishable from an ordinary jewel in appearance. When it is gazed through, a _gem of seeing_ enables the user to see as though she were affected by the true seeing spell. A _gem of seeing_ can be used for as many as 30 minutes a day, in increments of 5 minutes. These increments do not need to be consecutive.

Goblin Fire Drum

**Price** Varies; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Normal** 2,000 gp; **Greater** 4,500 gp

This small crude-looking drum is attached to a strap long enough to loop around the wearer's neck. A successful DC 12 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (percussion) check activates the drum, which enhances any nearby natural or magical fire as long as the bearer spends a move action each round to continue playing. All fires (including fire spells and effects) within 30 feet of the bearer deal an additional +1 point of fire damage per die (maximum +10).

All unattended flammable alchemical objects such as tindertwigs, flasks of oil or alchemist's fire, and fireworks within this range have a 10% chance of spontaneously igniting or exploding (as appropriate to the item) when the drum activates. This chance increases by 5% each round and is checked at the start of the performer's turn as long as the playing continues.

A _greater goblin fire drum_ has all the above abilities and can _create [pyrotechnics](spells/pyrotechnics#_pyrotechnics)_ once per day.

Goblin Skull Bomb

**Price** 1,200 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 1 lb.

An ember glow lights the beady eyes of this blackened, burned out goblin's skull. It is very brittle and shatters if dropped on solid ground. When a _goblin skull bomb_ breaks, the very last creature to touch it bursts into a raging magical flame, automatically suffering 5d6 points of fire damage and also catching fire should it fail a Reflex save (DC 13). If this kills the creature, its body burns away in one round, leaving behind only a pile of ash and the creature's blackened, burned-out skull, which is a new _goblin skull bomb_. If the target survives the fire, doesn't have a skull, or if its skull is destroyed before another creature touches it, it does not create a new _goblin skull bomb_.

A skull bomb can be used as a thrown weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. If the attacker hits, the skull shatters, immolating the target as described above. If the attacker misses, the skull breaks upon the floor or another nearby hard surface and the attacker bursts into flame. Touching the skull using gloves, gauntlets, or handheld items such as tools or weapons counts as touching the skull. It can be safely moved using spells (such as _ [mage hand](spells/mageHand#_mage-hand)_ or _ [telekinesis](spells/telekinesis#_telekinesis)_) or attacked with ranged weapons (hardness 0, 1 hp).

Golem Manual

**Price** Varies; **Aura** varies; **CL** varies; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Clay golem manual** 12,000 gp; **Flesh golem manual** 8,000 gp; **Iron golem manual** 35,000 gp; **Stone golem manual** 22,000 gp; **Stone golem guardian manual** 44,000 gp

A _golem manual_ contains information, incantations, and magical power that help a character to craft a golem. The instructions therein grant a +5 competence bonus on skill checks made to craft the golem's body. Each manual also holds the prerequisite spells needed for a specific golem (although these spells can only be used to create a golem and cannot be copied), effectively granting the builder use of the [Craft Construct](monsters/monsterFeats#_craft-construct) feat during the construction of the golem, and an increase to her caster level for the purpose of crafting a golem.

The spells included in a _golem manual_ require a spell trigger activation and can be activated only to assist in the construction of a golem. The cost of the book does not include the cost of constructing the golem's body. Once the golem is finished, the writing in the manual fades and the book is consumed in flames. When the book's ashes are sprinkled upon the golem, it becomes fully animated.

Grave Salt

**Price** 1,100 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

When poured on ground in a circle, this pure white salt sanctifies the enclosed area as the spell _ [consecrate](spells/consecrate#_consecrate)_. Applying the salt takes 1 round per dose. A single dose is sufficient to form a 5-foot radius circle, with each additional dose increasing the circle's radius by 5 feet. The area within the circle remains consecrated for 1 hour per dose, though any corporeal creature can spend a standard action to break the circle and end the effect prematurely. A newly created pouch of _grave salt_ holds 5 doses.

_Grave salt_ can also be used directly against restless spirits. A single dose can be hurled up to 15 feet as a ranged touch attack. An incorporeal undead creature struck by the salt must make a DC 14 Will save or take 1d4 points of Charisma damage. Strong winds and other effects that penalize ranged attacks make it impossible to employ the salt in this manner.

Grim Lantern

**Price** 5,800 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This macabre lantern is composed of a humanoid skull dangling from a short length of chain. A small fragment of soulstuff is trapped inside, burning slowly in a heatless flame. Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets, casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as _ [burning hands](spells/burningHands#_burning-hands)_. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty _grim lantern_, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature's soul, restoring its glow.

Handy Haversack

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** lbs.

A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a _bag of holding_ and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.

While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.

When played, a _harp of charming _enables the performer to work one _ [suggestion](spells/suggestion#_suggestion)_ (as the spell, Will DC 14 negates) into the music for each 10 minutes of playing if she can succeed on a DC 14 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (string) check.

**Price** 13,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This grand-looking wooden harp is carved with images of various venomous creatures. Once per day the bearer may play the harp to target a single opponent with a _ [poison](spells/poison#_poison)_ spell (DC 16). Alternatively, the bearer may play the harp to grant allies within 30 feet a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against disease and poison; maintaining this benefit each round is a standard action. If the player has the countersong bardic performance ability, he may expend rounds of bardic performance to use the harp to refocus his countersong against disease and poison instead of sonic or language-dependent effects.

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This finely crafted masterwork harp fits comfortably in one hand, but it requires two hands to play. The harp has 10 charges. By making a DC 10 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (string) check, the bearer can produce the following effects:

- _ [break](advanced/spells/break#_break-)_ (1 charge)
- _ [shatter](spells/shatter#_shatter)_ (2 charges)

When the last charge is expended, the harp loses all of its magic but still functions as a masterwork harp.

This malevolent-looking doll is made out of cheap rags and embroidery thread and is stuffed with straw or sawdust. A creature holding or carrying the doll takes a –4 penalty on saving throws against witch hexes. Alternatively, if the doll is stuffed with the hair of a creature, any witch holding the doll increases the DC of her hexes by +2 when using the hexes against that creature. A doll used in this way does not cause the witch to take a penalty on her saving throws.

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 4 lbs.

Carved from the bone of some giant beast, this large horn emits an eerie, heart-lurching moan when sounded. A creature with the favored enemy class feature may blow the horn as a standard action to daze one type of favored enemy within 90 feet for 1d4 rounds (DC 13 Will save negates). Creatures suffer a penalty on this save equal to the ranger's favored enemy bonus against that type of creature. This is a sonic, mind-affecting effect; creatures that cannot hear the horn are immune to its magic. The horn's magic works once per day.

Horn of Battle Clarity

The call of this hollowed-out animal horn rallies nearby creatures to battle. When the horn is blown, all creatures within 60 feet who have not yet acted in combat are no longer considered flat-footed. The horn has no effect on other conditions or abilities that treat a creature as flat-footed.

A barbarian who sounds a _horn of battle clarity_ may spend 2 rounds of rage to act as if she had the superstition rage power for the remainder of that battle.

Horn of Blasting

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This spiraling animal horn can be sounded as a normal horn, but if the command word is spoken and the instrument is then played, it deals 5d6 points of sonic damage to creatures within a 40-foot cone and causes them to be deafened for 2d6 rounds (a DC 16 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the deafening). Crystalline objects and creatures take 7d6 points of sonic damage, with no save unless they're held, worn, or carried by creatures (Fortitude DC 16 negates).

If a _horn of blasting_ is used magically more than once in a given day, there is a 20% cumulative chance with each extra use that it explodes and deals 10d6 points of sonic damage to the person sounding it.

This horn functions as a _horn of blasting_, except that it deals 10d6 points of sonic damage, stuns creatures for 1 round, and deafens them for 4d6 rounds (a DC 19 Fortitude save reduces the damage by half and negates the stunning and deafening). Crystalline objects take 16d6 points of sonic damage as described for the _horn of blasting_. A _greater horn of blasting_ also has a 20% cumulative chance of exploding for each usage beyond the first each day.

Horn of Fog

This small bugle allows its possessor to blow forth a thick cloud of heavy fog similar to that of an _ [obscuring mist](spells/obscuringMist#_obscuring-mist)_ spell. The fog covers a 10-foot square next to the horn blower each round that the user continues to blow the horn; a fog cloud travels 10 feet each round in a straight line from the emanation point unless blocked by something substantial such as a wall. The device makes a deep, foghorn-like noise, with the note dropping abruptly to a lower register at the end of each blast. The fog dissipates after 3 minutes. A moderate wind (11+ mph) disperses the fog in 4 rounds; a strong wind (21+ mph) disperses the fog in 1 round.

Horn of Goodness/Evil

**Price** 6,500 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This trumpet adapts itself to its owner, so it produces either a good or an evil effect depending on the owner's alignment. If the owner is neither good nor evil, the horn has no power whatsoever. If she is good, then blowing the horn has the effect of a _ [magic circle against evil](spells/magicCircleAgainstEvil#_magic-circle-against-evil)_. If she is evil, then blowing the horn has the effect of a _ [magic circle against good](spells/magicCircleAgainstGood#_magic-circle-against-good)_. In either case, this ward lasts for 1 hour.

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 11th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This elongated bull's horn curves sharply at the end, almost making it seem more like an enormous smoking pipe than a tool for the hunt. Once each day, a person with the hunter's bond (companions) class feature may blow the horn as a standard action; this grants his full favored enemy bonus (instead of half) against a single target to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. The effect lasts for 1 minute.

This device is a large, intricately inscribed and decorated conch shell that can be blown once per day (except by a triton, who can sound it three times per day). Blowing the horn activates any one of the following functions:

- Calm rough waters in a 1-mile radius. Alternatively, this functions as a _ [dismissal](spells/dismissal#_dismissal)_ spell against a targeted water elemental (DC 19 negates).
- Summon 1d4+1 sharks or 1d3 advanced sharks as if using _ [summon nature's ally V](spells/summonNatureSAlly#_summon-nature-s-ally-v)_.
- Create a _ [fear](spells/fear#_fear)_ effect (DC 16 negates) in a 500-foot radius that only affects creatures with the aquatic or amphibious subtype which have Intelligence scores of 1 or 2.

Horn of Valhalla

**Price** 50,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This magic instrument comes in four varieties. Each appears to be a normal, scarred old horn used for hunting or signaling during battle. When someone speaks its command word and blows the horn, however, the horn summons a number of human barbarians to fight for the character who summoned them. Each horn can be blown just once every 7 days. Roll d% and refer to the table above to see what type of horn is found. The horn's type determines what barbarians are summoned and what prerequisite is needed to use the horn. Any character who uses a _horn of Valhalla_ but doesn't have the prerequisite is attacked by the barbarians she herself summoned.

Summoned barbarians are constructs, not actual people (though they seem to be); they arrive with the starting equipment for barbarians. They attack anyone the possessor of the horn commands them to fight until they or their opponents are slain or until 1 hour has elapsed, whichever comes first.

| d% | Type of Horn | Barbarians Summoned | Prerequisite |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

Hourglass of Last Chances

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration and transmutation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

This tiny hourglass is filled with blood-red sand. The sand flows only one way and turning it to start the flow activates its magic. It grants a target creature within 30 feet the following benefits for a limited time—_ [freedom of movement](spells/freedomOfMovement#_freedom-of-movement)_ (as the spell), and suspends any and all of the following conditions: blinded, confused, dazed, dazzled, deafened, diseased, exhausted, fatigued, feebleminded, insanity, nauseated, poisoned, sickened, and stunned. These effects are suspended rather than dispelled; they resume when the hourglass is deactivated or expended and this suspended time does not count toward the duration of the suppressed effect.

Ending the hourglass's effects is a swift action. The hourglass can be used for up to 5 rounds in total before its magic is consumed. These rounds need not be consecutive.

Hybridization Funnel

**Price** 200 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This two-spouted funnel is used to safely mix two alchemical splash weapons into a single flask. Using the vial requires 10 minutes and a DC 25 [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (alchemy) check; a half-elf has a +5 bonus on this check. Failing the check means both splash weapon are destroyed. Success means the two materials are safely mixed into one vial that is the same volume as a normal splash weapon vial; when thrown as a splash weapon, the mixture has the effects of both component substances and creatures are affected as if hit by both. The mixture becomes inert after 24 hours. Only liquids may be mixed with the funnel. The bearer can use it to mix an alchemical splash weapon with either holy water or unholy water, but the [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (alchemy) DC increases to 30; half-elves still get the +5 bonus on this check. The funnel does not work on potions, elixirs, extracts, or other materials. Mixing a substance with a similar or identical substance (such as alchemist's fire with alchemist's fire) has no effect. A mixture cannot be combined with another mixture.

Incense of Meditation

**Price** 4,900 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This incense comes in many shapes and colors, but is otherwise indistinguishable from nonmagical incense until lit. When it is burned, the special fragrance and pearly hued smoke of this special incense are recognizable by anyone making a DC 15 [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check.

When a divine spellcaster lights a block of _incense of meditation_ and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, the incense enables him to prepare all his spells as though affected by the [Maximize Spell](feats#_maximize-spell) feat. However, all the spells prepared in this way are at their normal level, not at three levels higher (as with the regular metamagic feat).

Each block of incense burns for 8 hours, and the effects persist for 24 hours. The incense may be burned in a _censer of controlling air elements_ to summon a more powerful elemental; this renders it useless for maximizing spellcasting.

Incense of Transcendence

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

The heady vapors of this coiled incense facilitate a deep meditative trance. When an oracle lights a coil of _incense of transcendence_ and then spends 8 hours praying and meditating nearby, she can replace one of her revelations with another revelation. The new revelation must be one available to her (such as from the same mystery) and must be available at the same class level as the original revelation (for example, she cannot replace a revelation available at 1st level with a revelation requiring a minimum of 7th level). If she replaces a revelation that is a prerequisite for another revelation or ability, she cannot use that other revelation or ability while under the influence of the incense.

The coil of incense burns for 8 hours. Its effects persist for 24 hours, after which the oracle's original revelations return.

This metal badge of a rampant griffon, lion, horse, or similar heraldic creature must be attached to a shield or armor to function. Attaching or removing it requires a DC 15 [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (armor) check, 10 minutes, and appropriate tools. Its powers only function if the wearer of the shield or armor has the channel energy and smite abilities. If the wearer dispatches an opponent with a smite attack (killing it, destroying it, or reducing its hit points below 0), she may expend one use of her channel energy ability as a swift action that round.

**Price** 7,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This thin steel plate is approximately 1 foot square. When the command word is spoken, it rapidly stretches outward and unfolds, becoming a panel 1 inch thick, 3 feet wide, and up to 30 feet long (stopping its extension when it encounters any resistance, such as a wall, ceiling, or a creature.) Each 5-foot segment of the metal bridge has hardness 10 and 30 hit points. The bridge weighs 300 pounds and can support up to 4,000 pounds. When the command word is repeated, it collapses into its portable form once more.

The_ instant bridge _can be activated up to three times per day. If any part of it destroyed while it is extended, it immediately loses all magic.

Instant Fortress

**Price** 55,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over. The fortress has a small door that opens only at the command of the owner of the fortress—even _ [knock](spells/knock#_knock)_ spells can't open the door.

The adamantine walls of an _instant fortress_ have 100 hit points and hardness 20. The fortress cannot be repaired except by a _ [wish](spells/wish#_wish)_ or a _ [miracle](spells/miracle#_miracle)_, which restores 50 points of damage taken.

The fortress springs up in just 1 round, with the door facing the device's owner. The door opens and closes instantly at his command. People and creatures nearby (except the owner) must be careful not to be caught by the fortress's sudden growth. Anyone so caught takes 10d10 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 halves).

The fortress is deactivated by speaking a command word (different from the one used to activate it). It cannot be deactivated unless it is empty.

Ioun Stone

**Price** varies; **Aura** strong varied; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. _Ioun stones_ have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. The powers of each stone vary depending on its color and shape (see the table on page 306).

Regeneration from the _pearly white ioun stone_ works like a _ [ring of regeneration](magicItems/rings#_ring-of-regeneration)_. It only cures damage taken while the character is using the stone. The pale lavender and lavender-and-green stones work like a _ [rod of absorption](magicItems/rods#_rod-of-absorption)_, but absorbing a spell requires a readied action, and these stones cannot be used to empower spells. Stored spells in the vibrant purple stone must be placed by a spellcaster but can be used by anyone (see_ ring of minor [spell storing](magicItems/weapons#_spell-storing)_). See table on next page.

Iron Bands of Binding

**Price** 26,000 gp; **Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This potent item is a 3-inch-diameter rusty iron sphere wrapped in iron bands.

When the proper command word is spoken and the spherical iron device is hurled at an opponent, the bands expand and then contract to bind the target creature on a successful ranged touch attack. A single Large or smaller creature can be captured thus and held immobile (as if pinned) until the command word is spoken to bring the bands into spherical form again. The creature can break (and destroy) the bands with a DC 30 Strength check or escape them with a DC 30 combat maneuver check or [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) check. _Iron bands of binding_ are usable once per day.

Iron Flask

**Price** 170,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 20th; **Weight** 1 lb.

These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.

The command word can be used only once per day.

If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile. A purchased bottle is empty, but a newly discovered bottle might contain any of the following:

| d% | Contents | d% | Contents |

When the end of this gray hemp rope is held and the command word is uttered, it is irrevocably transmuted into solid iron. The transmuted rope loses all magic and has the hardness and hit points of a normal inch-thick iron bar. When crafted, the rope is 25 feet long, but can be cut up to three times and each section of rope can be commanded to harden individually.

Iron Spike of Safe Passage

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

When hammered into place this 9-inch iron spike creates an illusion up to 15 feet high and in a 15-foot diameter centered on the spike. The illusion can be of one of the following: a small hillock of appropriate composition for the terrain, a pile of mundane crates or barrels, a mound of rubble, or a small structure (such as a cabin or canvas enclosure). The exact size and specific parameters (such the composition of timber) are chosen when the spike is placed. Interacting with the illusion grants a Will save (DC 12) to disbelieve it.

Hammering the spike into place or removing it is a full-round action. The spike can be used any number of times and its effects last until removed.

This ornate brass key automatically reshapes itself to fit any standard keyhole (generally those in doors scaled for use by Small or Medium creatures, not deliberately oversized locks like the main door to a dwarven fortress). Once placed inside a lock, the key merges with the lock and fills up all open spaces within it, creating a solid piece of metal and making it impossible to unlock it, even with magic. While securing the lock, the key strengthens its materials, adding +2 to the lock's hardness, +8 to its hit points, and +5 to its Break DC. Touching the key and speaking the command word causes the key to disintegrate, leaving the lock intact and rendering the mechanism operable again.

This humble pad of woven river reeds allows its owner to recover his mental fortitude and _ki_ pool by practicing breathing exercises and other forms of meditation. Each hour its owner spends sitting on the mat without taking any other action, he can attempt to center himself by making a Wisdom check with a DC of 10 + the monk's current number of _ki_ points (note that ability checks, like skill checks, do not automatically succeed on a 20). If the check is successful, the monk regains 1 _ki_ point.

This narrow cloth flag is made to attach to the end a knight's lance, though it can be flown from a spear, polearm, or even a staff. It has no effect if not mounted appropriately. A _knight's pennon_ grants different benefits depending on its color and design.

_Battle_: The red _knight's pennon of battle_ allows its bearer to benefit from _ [heroism](spells/heroism#_heroism)_ once per day.

_Honor_: The gold _knight's pennon of honor_ bestows _ [protection from evil](spells/protectionFromEvil#_protection-from-evil)_ upon the bearer once per day.

Last Leaves of the Autumn Dryad

**Price** 52,000 gp; **Aura** moderate divination and transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

This vibrant cluster of leaves constantly changes hue through the different colors of the autumn season, from brown and red to orange and yellow. Once per day, the bearer may touch the leaves to her tongue to assume _ [tree shape](spells/treeShape#_tree-shape)_ (as the spell) for up to 8 hours, appearing as a healthy tree that is lush with thousands of autumn leaves for the duration of the effect.

While in tree form, a creature may release these leaves upon the wind, consciously controlling them as a scrying sensor with the abilities of _ [arcane eye](spells/arcaneEye#_arcane-eye)_. The leaves have the statistics of an army ant swarm, except the swarm has plant traits, fast healing 5, and vulnerability to fire.

The creature may shape the scrying leaves into a semblance of her face, allowing her to speak through the leaves. The leaves' voice is a quiet, dry rustle, and they are capable of conveying most of the creature's intended facial expressions (they can smile, frown, and so on). If the creature has the wild empathy class ability or is a sorcerer with the fey bloodline, she may have any _ [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound#_ghost-sound)_, _ [speak with animals](spells/speakWithAnimals#_speak-with-animals)_, or _ [speak with plants](spells/speakWithPlants#_speak-with-plants)_ spell she casts originate from the leaves instead of herself, and her _ [tree shape](spells/treeShape#_tree-shape)_ does not prevent her from casting these spells.

If the scrying leaves fail to return before creature returns to its normal shape, the magic item does not function for 1 week. During this time, the leaves fade to brown and appear to have a light coating of frost on them.

Life Link Badge

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 1 lb.

When this plain leather badge is sewn onto a summoner's armor or clothing, a faded image of his summoner rune appears on its surface. The summoner can add charges to the badge by expending summoner spells slots; the badge gains charges equal to the spell level of the slot expended (maximum 5 charges). Adding charges to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended). When the summoner uses his life link ability, instead of sacrificing his own hit points, he may expend charges from the badge to heal the eidolon 1d6 hit points per charge. The summoner does not have to decide how many charges are spent beforehand (he may expend one charge, roll, and decide whether or not to spend more charges for more healing). All charges in the badge are lost when the summoner readies spells after resting.

This buckler-sized mirror magnifies flaws and faults, presenting the least appealing image of any creature reflected in it. The mirror must be held in one hand to function. As a standard action three times per day, the bearer of the mirror can project a reflection onto the creature that produced it, making them appear utterly loathsome to all onlookers. The subject must be within 30 feet of the mirror, and must be able to see the mirror to be affected. For the next 5 rounds any creature attempting to target the subject with a beneficial spell or effect must make a DC 14 Will save. On a failure, the creature must choose a new subject for the spell or effect is wasted. Once a creature succeeds on this saving throw, it can target the subject normally for the remainder of the mirror's effect's duration.

**Crusades** 100,000 gp; **Swiftness** 10,000 gp; **Terror** 56,000 gp; **Victory** 75,000 gp

A _lord's banner_ is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.

A _lord's banner_ may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.

_Crusades _(evocation aura): A noble-looking _lord's banner of crusades_ emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design).

_Swiftness _(abjuration aura): A group or army that are traveling under a _lord's banner of swiftness_ can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.

_Terror _(necromancy aura): Enemies of the bearer of a _lord's banner of terror_, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a DC 16 Will save or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 24 hours.

_Victory _(evocation aura): Allies of the owner of a _lord's banner of victory_ gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.

Lyre of Building

**Price** 13,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** lbs.

This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a _horn of blasting_, a _ [disintegrate](spells/disintegrate#_disintegrate)_ spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.

The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (string instruments) check. If she fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.

This undistinguished metal lump has no powers in its default state. By concentrating on it for 1 minute, a creature who worships a deity may transform it into a masterwork holy symbol of that deity. Whenever this holy symbol is used as a focus for channeled energy, as a free action the bearer can alter the channel area to one of the following options:

The wielder of the mallet can, as a full-round action, swing the hammer to create and immediately hammer into place a copper nail, iron spike, iron piton, or 4-foot wooden fence post. A created fence post can penetrate earth, and the other materials can penetrate earth, wood, or stone. Removing the created item from the surface destroys it, but otherwise the item lasts as long as a normal object of its sort. The mallet can create up to 100 items per day.

Martyr's Tear

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 6th; **Weight** —

This imperfect, rose-tinted gemstone resembles a teardrop or a broken heart depending on its orientation. Its pale facets are typically marred by a single crack or chip near the gem's middle.

Once per day, the bearer may spend a standard action to transfer 3d6 hit points from himself into the gem. This deepens the gem's color, with a stronger color indicating more life energy stored in it. The gem can store a maximum of 18 hit points. If any hit points are stored in the gem, the bearer may touch it himself or another creature as a standard action, transferring all the stored life energy from the gem to the target creature, healing it a number of hit points equal to the amount stored in the gem. This returns the gem to its normal color.

Marvelous Pigments

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th; **Weight** —

These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image. One pot of _marvelous pigments_ is sufficient to create a 1,000-cubic-foot object by depicting it two-dimensionally over a 100-square-foot surface.

Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface. It takes 10 minutes and a DC 15 [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (painting) check to depict an object with the pigments. _Marvelous pigments_ cannot create magic items. Objects of value depicted by the pigments—precious metals, gems, jewelry, ivory, and so on—appear to be valuable but are really made of tin, lead, glass, brass, bone, and other such inexpensive materials. The user can create normal weapons, armor, and any other mundane item (including foodstuffs) whose value does not exceed 2,000 gp. The effect is instantaneous.

This lustrous golden bell produces a deep and resonant ring which vibrates in perfect harmony with the Material Plane and destructively interferes with otherworldly beings. These vibrations reduce the damage reduction and spell resistance of all extraplanar creatures within 30 feet by 5 (for example, changing DR 10/magic to DR 5/magic). The bell has no clapper; to ring it, the bearer must attack it with an unarmed strike (this counts as an attack, with no attack roll needed, and does not damage the bell). The ringing lasts 1d6 rounds; stifling the ringing early is a standard action. It can ring for a maximum of 10 rounds per day.

Migrus Locker

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 20 lbs.

This small locker is carved from fossilized wood and it is usually found chained and sealed. When the locker is unsealed and opened, the migrus—a desiccated hairless cat with a humanoid face—is found within. After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the _migrus locker_. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master.

The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body.

The migrus has attributes of a cat familiar (_Bestiary_ 131) except it has the construct type. The migrus always does its best to return to its master and cannot be permanently destroyed by normal means. If the locker is destroyed (hardness 5, 10 hp), the migrus is destroyed, no matter the distance to the locker.

Mirror of Guarding Reflections

**Price** 7,000 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 4 lbs.

Reflections visible in this palm-sized hand mirror always seem ghostly and insubstantial. When a creature holding the mirror is targeted by an attack, he can spend an immediate action to summon his reflection from the glass to interpose itself between him and the blow. The reflection functions as an image produced by the spell _ [mirror image](spells/mirrorImage#_mirror-image)_. If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result. If the attack does not strike the image, the image fades away at the start of the mirror bearer's next turn. The mirror can be used three times per day.

Mirror of Life Trapping

**Price** 200,000 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 0 lbs.

This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A _mirror of life trapping_ has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).

When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.

If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.

Mirror of Mental Prowess

**Price** 175,000 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration and divination; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 40 lbs.

This mirror resembles an ordinary looking glass 5 feet tall by 2 feet wide. A creature who knows the proper commands can cause it to perform as follows.

- Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.
- View other places as if with _clairvoyance_, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them.
- Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the _clairvoyance_ function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a _ [scrying](spells/scrying#_scrying)_ spell. Any creature who steps through the portal appears in front of the mirror.
- Once per week the mirror accurately answers one short question regarding a creature whose image is shown on its surface (giving answers similar to those from the _ [legend lore](spells/legendLore#_legend-lore)_ spell).

Mirror of Opposition

**Price** 92,000 gp; **Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 45 lbs.

This item resembles a normal mirror about 4 feet long and 3 feet wide. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by speaking a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. If a creature sees its reflection in the mirror's surface, an exact duplicate of that creature comes into being. This opposite immediately attacks the original. The duplicate has all the possessions and powers of its original (including magic). Upon the defeat or destruction of either the duplicate or the original, the duplicate and its items disappear completely. The mirror functions up to four times per day. Destroying the mirror (hardness 1, 5 hit points) causes all of the duplicates to immediately vanish.

Naga-scale Bindi

**Price** 6,600 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

This shining, jewel-like scale is usually worn on the forehead between the eyebrows, though a creature can affix the scale to any part of her body by pressing it to her skin and speaking its command word. Once affixed, the scale causes the creature to take on the attributes of a particular type of naga, chosen when the scale was created. Her skin becomes scaly, her eyes slitted and reptilian, her tongue forked, and her neck lengthens and distends until it resembles a cobra's hood. The creature gains a +4 bonus to her natural armor, darkvision 60 feet, and a poisonous bite attack that deals 1d4 points of damage (1d3 for a Small creature)Bite—injury; _save_ Fort DC 19; _frequency_ 1/round for 6 rounds; _effect_ varies by the scale's naga type (see below); _cure_ 1 save. Each scale also grants its wearer access to a special ability, as follows:

_Dark naga_: The wearer gains a +8 bonus on saves made to resist any form of mind reading and a +2 bonus against charm effects. _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: sleep for 1 round.

_Guardian naga_: The wearer can spit venom up to 30 feet as a standard action. This is a ranged touch attack with no range increment. Opponents hit by this attack must make saves to avoid the poison's effect. _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: 1d2 Con damage.

_Spirit naga_: Once per minute, the wearer can attempt to charm a single creature within 30 feet, as the spell _ [charm person](spells/charmPerson#_charm-person)_ (Will DC 19 negates). _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: 1d4 Con damage.

_Lunar naga_: Once per day, the wearer can spend a standard action to fascinate all creatures within 30 feet, as per the spell _ [hypnotism](spells/hypnotism#_hypnotism)_ (Will DC 19 negates). _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: 1d3 Con and 1 Wis.

_Royal naga_: Once per day, the wearer can attempt to blind or deafen a single creature within 30 feet, as the spell _ [blindness/deafness](spells/blindnessDeafness#_blindness-deafness)_ (Will DC 19 negates). _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: 1d6 bleed.

_Water naga_: The wearer gains a swim speed equal to its base land speed, and can breathe water or air. _ [Poison](spells/poison#_poison) effect_: 1 Con.

The bindi's effects last for 11 minutes, or until the creature spends a standard action to return to her normal form. The bindi can be used twice before it loses its luster and becomes nonmagical.

These tattooing needles can grant a +5 competence bonus on [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (tattoos) checks. Once per day they can be used to transform an object into a tattoo on a willing creature. This takes 10 minutes. The object may resist with a DC 17 Fortitude saving throw. The transformed object radiates faint transmutation magic and looks like a miniature depiction of itself. The bearer of the tattoo may peel it off as a standard action, transforming it back into its object form. The tattoo automatically reverts back to its object form after 7 days, if dispelled (using the caster level of the needles), or upon the death of the tattooed creature.

Noble's Vigilant Pillbox

**Price** 3,600 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This heart-shaped charm is set with three pearls: one white, one silver, and one black. Inside, a tiny compartment usually contains smelling salts (page 101) or alchemist's kindness (page 100). Each pearl has a primary, passive ability and a secondary, active ability that activates if it is removed from the setting and swallowed (a standard action, as if drinking a potion). Swallowing a pearl destroys it. A command word activates the primary abilities of all three pearls for 1 round.

When activated, the white pearl detects poison in a 10-foot radius around the wearer, dulling to a dark gray if poison is within range. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a _ [delay poison](spells/delayPoison#_delay-poison)_ spell.

The silver pearl detects diseases in a 10-foot radius, turning bright blue on discovery. If swallowed, it grants the benefit of a _ [remove disease](spells/removeDisease#_remove-disease)_ spell.

The black pearl turns white if any invisible creature is within 10 feet of the wearer. If swallowed, it grants the benefits of _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility#_see-invisibility)_ for 1 minute.

A charms found with missing pearls has its price reduced appropriately; a white pearl is worth 750 gp, a silver pearl is worth 1,150 gp, and black pearl is worth 1,700 gp.

This alabaster sphere, overlaid with golden bands set with diamonds in runelike patterns, sheds light like a _ [continual flame](spells/continualFlame#_continual-flame)_ spell.

This stiff folded paper vaguely resembles a hand-sized pest such as a beetle, spider, or cockroach. Completing two key folds in the paper causes it to multiply into hundreds of similar-sized duplicates of itself. These duplicates fill a 10-foot space and act as a rat swarm, except they have fire vulnerability, the construct type, and do not have the disease special ability.

The spell is then prepared again, just as if it had not been cast. The spell must be of a particular level, depending on the pearl.

This magic item appears to be a small set of pan pipes. When played by a person who succeeds on a DC 15 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (wind instruments) check, the pipes create an eerie, spellbinding tune. Those within 30 feet who hear the tune must succeed at a DC 13 Will save or become frightened for 4 rounds. Creatures with 6 or more Hit Dice are unaffected. _Pipes of haunting_ can be sounded twice a day.

Pipes of Pain

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

By making a DC 15 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (wind instruments) check, the bearer can use these pipes to create a wondrous melody which fascinates creatures within 30 feet for as long as the bearer continues to play (Will DC 14 negates). This is a mind-affecting sonic compulsion effect. The bearer is immune to the sound of the pipes. When the bearer stops playing, for the next 2d4 rounds all creatures who were fascinated by the music are stricken by intense pain at even the slightest noise. Unless a creature is in a totally silent area, it takes 1d4 points of damage per round on its turn, and it has sonic vulnerability until this time expires. Thereafter, the creature is shaken unless it is in a totally silent area; this hypersensitivity to noise is a curse effect.

Pipes of Sounding

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 2nd; **Weight** 3 lbs.

When played by a character who has the [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (wind instruments) skill, these shiny metallic pan pipes create a variety of sounds that can imitate creatures, environmental sounds, or most other sounds. The figment sounds are the equivalent of _ [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound#_ghost-sound)_.

Pipes of the Sewers

**Price** 1,150 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 2nd; **Weight** 3 lbs.

If the possessor learns the proper tune, he can use these pipes to attract 1d3 rat swarms if any rats are within 400 feet. For each 50-foot distance the rats have to travel, there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) (wind instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piper's telepathic commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave immediately. The [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) DC increases by +5 for each time the rats have been successfully called in a 24-hour period.

If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the controller to the [Perform](skills/perform#_perform) check DC. Once control is assumed, another check is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively seeking to reassert its control.

Polymorphic Pouch

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This leather pouch is usually decorated with a druidic motif. Within is an extradimensional space that can hold 4 cubic feet or 40 pounds worth of items and otherwise functions as a small _bag of holding_. If the bearer uses a polymorph effect or wild shape to transform into an animal, dragon, elemental, magical beast, plant, or vermin, the pouch never merges with her body. It automatically relocates to an easily-accessible place on her body (such as on a belt or a cord around her neck), allowing her to access the pouch and items within it while she is transformed.

Portable Hole

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

A _portable hole_ is a circle of cloth spun from the webs of a phase spider interwoven with strands of ether and beams of starlight, resulting in a portable extradimensional space. When opened fully, a _portable hole_ is 6 feet in diameter, but it can be folded up to be as small as a pocket handkerchief. When spread upon any surface, it causes an extradimensional space 10 feet deep to come into being. This hole can be picked up from inside or out by simply taking hold of the edges of the cloth and folding it up. Either way, the entrance disappears, but anything inside the hole remains, traveling with the item.

The only air in the hole is that which enters when the hole is opened. It contains enough air to supply one Medium creature or two Small creatures for 10 minutes. The cloth does not accumulate weight even if its hole is filled. Each _portable hole_ opens on its own particular nondimensional space. If a _bag of holding_ is placed within a _portable hole_, a rift to the Astral Plane is torn in that place. Both the bag and the cloth are sucked into the void and forever lost. If a _portable hole_ is placed within a _bag of holding_, it opens a gate to the Astral Plane. The hole, the bag, and any creatures within a 10-foot radius are drawn there, the _portable hole_ and _bag of holding_ being destroyed in the process.

Prayer Wheel of Ethical Strength

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

Sacred or profane mantras cover the outer face of this cylindrical wooden block, which rotates around a decorative brass spindle. By holding the spindle in one hand while meditating or resting to regain _ki_, the bearer may attune his _ki_ points to the wheel. Once attuned, the bearer's _ki_ strikes count as good (if the wheel has sacred mantras) or evil (if the wheel has profane mantras) instead of lawful for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain _ki_ points. A creature can only be attuned to one prayer wheel at a time, and a prayer wheel can only be attuned to one person at a time. Only creatures who can make lawfully-aligned _ki_ strikes can use a prayer wheel.

This small, durable flask is designed to preserve alchemical extracts indefinitely. An extract stored in a _preserving flask_ remains potent until it is consumed or otherwise removed from the flask. Preserved extracts count against an alchemist's extracts per day on the day they are prepared, but not on subsequent days. Each flask is capable of preserving an extract of a particular level. An extract stored in the flask retains duration, caster level, and other properties it had when it was created. The flask works on extracts and infusions, but not mutagens.

Pyxes of Redirected Focus

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

This round metal container is just large enough to contain the wooden, coin-sized token inside. Each side of the token is inscribed with a different prayer. Once per day, a cleric (or other class with cleric domains) may activate the pyxes and may select any one of her prepared domain spells and replace it with the domain spell of that level from her other domain. For example, a cleric with the Fire and Luck domains could switch her 1st-level prepared _ [burning hands](spells/burningHands#_burning-hands)_ domain spell to _ [true strike](spells/trueStrike#_true-strike)_. The pyxes has no effect on creatures with no domain spells or only one domain.

Racing Broom of Flying

**Price** 30,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

A _racing broom of flying_ functions like a _broom of flying_, except for 9 minutes per day it can fly faster than its standard counterpart. Activating this increased speed is a swift action. The broom's increased fly speed is 60 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 40 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. Each minute at this faster speed uses 1 hour of the broom's daily flight time. As a swift action, the rider may expend 5 hours of flight time to increase the broom's speed to 120 feet with a load up to 200 pounds, or at a speed of 80 feet carrying up to 400 pounds. This speed boost lasts for 1 round, but when it ends there is a 50% chance that the broom gains the broken condition and is powerless until repaired.

Restless Lockpicks

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This set of mithral masterwork thieves' tools springs to life in the hands of a skilled user. If the user attempts to use the tools to disarm a trap or other device, he may spend a standard action beginning the disarm attempt, after which the tools continue on their own without being held. Thereafter, the bearer may perform other actions or even move away while the tools work. The tools make a [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) using the bearer's skill bonus plus the +2 for being masterwork thieves' tools, taking the normal amount of time to disable the device. When the skill check is completed, the tools remain in place until removed from the device. The tools can animate for up to 10 rounds per day. They can take 10 but cannot take 20. If there aren't enough rounds left in the tools to finish a particular check, the bearer can continue where the animated tools left off as long as she is in the square with the tools when the animation duration runs out.

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

A jar of this unguent is 3 inches in diameter and 1 inch deep, and contains 5 applications. Placed upon a poisoned wound or swallowed, the ointment detoxifies any poison (as _ [neutralize poison](spells/neutralizePoison#_neutralize-poison)_ with a +5 bonus on the check). Applied to a diseased area, it removes the disease (as _ [remove disease](spells/removeDisease#_remove-disease)_ with a +5 bonus on the check).

Ring Gates

**Price** 40,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 1 lb.

These always come in pairs—two iron rings, each about 18 inches in diameter. The rings must be on the same plane of existence and within 100 miles of each other to function. Whatever is put through one ring comes out the other, and up to 100 pounds of material can be transferred each day. (Objects only partially pushed through and then retracted do not count.) This useful device allows for instantaneous transport of items or messages, or even attacks. A character can reach through to grab things near the other ring, or even stab a weapon through if so desired. Alternatively, a character could stick his head through to look around. A spellcaster could even cast a spell through a _ring [gate](spells/gate#_gate)_. A Small character can make a DC 13 [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) check to slip through. Creatures of Tiny, Diminutive, or Fine size can pass through easily. Each ring has an "entry side" and an "exit side," both marked with appropriate symbols.

The weight listed is per ring.

Rope of Climbing

**Price** 3,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 3 lbs.

A 60-foot-long _rope of climbing_ is no thicker than a wand, but it is strong enough to support 3,000 pounds. Upon command, the rope snakes forward, upward, downward, or in any other direction at 10 feet per round, attaching itself securely wherever its owner desires. It can unfasten itself and return in the same manner.

A _rope of climbing_ can be commanded to knot or unknot itself. This causes large knots to appear at 1-foot intervals along the rope. Knotting shortens the rope to a 50-foot length until the knots are untied, but lowers the DC of [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks while using it by 10. A creature must hold one end of the rope when its magic is invoked.

Rope of Entanglement

**Price** 21,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

A _rope of entanglement_ looks just like any other hempen rope about 30 feet long. Upon command, the rope lashes forward 20 feet or upward 10 feet to entangle a victim. An entangled creature can break free with a DC 20 Strength check or a DC 20 [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) check.

A _rope of entanglement_ has AC 22, 12 hit points, hardness 10, and damage reduction 5/slashing. The rope repairs damage to itself at a rate of 1 point per 5 minutes, but if a _rope of entanglement_ is severed (all 12 hit points lost to damage), it is destroyed.

Rope of Knots

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

This rope is 100 feet long and can perform all the functions of a _rope of climbing_. Furthermore, upon command the _rope of knots_ snakes out and knots itself into a rope structure. The rope can tie itself into any structure which can be created out of 100 feet of rope. Possible structures include (but are not limited to) a sturdy rope bridge up to 25 feet long, a 10-foot-square net or hammock, or a 40-foot-tall rope ladder. The rope takes up to 10 rounds to create a complex structure or half that time to return itself to a simple coil. The rope has hardness 1 and 20 hit points. It repairs damage to itself at a rate of 2 hit points every 10 minutes.

Salve of Slipperiness

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 6th; **Weight** —

This substance provides a +20 competence bonus on all [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) checks and combat maneuver checks made to escape from a grapple. The salve also grants a +10 competence bonus to the wearer's CMD for the purpose of avoiding grapple attempts. In addition, such obstructions as webs (magical or otherwise) do not affect an anointed individual. Magic ropes and the like do not avail against this salve. If it is smeared on a floor or on steps, the area should be treated as a long-lasting _ [grease](spells/grease#_grease)_ spell. The salve requires 8 hours to wear off normally, or it can be wiped off with an alcohol solution (even wine).

_Salve of slipperiness_ is needed to coat the inside of a container meant to hold _sovereign glue_.

A _ [scabbard of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_scabbard-of-keen-edges) [keen](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-keen) edges_ can shrink or enlarge to accommodate any knife, dagger, sword, or similar weapon up to and including a greatsword. Up to three times per day on command, the scabbard casts _ [keen edge](spells/keenEdge#_keen-edge)_ on any blade placed within it.

This fine, red leather sheath is decorated with gold filigree. It fits any bladed slashing weapon. While worn, a _scabbard of stanching_ protects against bleed damage. Anytime the wearer suffers a bleed effect, the scabbard automatically stanches it. It has no effect on bleed damage from effects that require a DC 16 or higher caster level or [Heal](skills/heal#_heal) check.

School of Eyes

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This item is a flask of syrupy fluid with an eyeball floating in it. When a creature drinks the entire flask, 1d4 rounds later he is stunned for 1 round as 1d4+1 floating fish with large eyes for heads crawl out of his flesh. Once these eye-fish free themselves, they hover near the drinker, always staying in the drinker's square, and otherwise function as the eyes from a _ [prying eyes](spells/pryingEyes#_prying-eyes)_ spell, except they are Tiny rather than Fine. As long as the drinker has at least three of the fish in his square, he gains a +10 competence bonus on sight-based [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) checks. Every 1d6 × 10 minutes, 1d4+1 more eye-fish crawl out of his flesh, stunning him for 1 round each time. Each flask can produce up to 1d4+10 fish total; once this many have appeared, no more are created. The fish remain until they are destroyed or until 10 hours pass from the time the flask was used.

This sight can be attached to a single two-handed firearm. When this is done, the sight becomes part of the weapon, but can be removed from that weapon with a full-round action. A firearm wielder using a firearm that has this sight can choose to spend a full-round action to either locate an invisible creature within line of sight or make a single shot that ignores the invisibility of a creature that she knows is in the area.

This rich tea can be made from any number of herbs. When the tea is brewed without a filter and imbibed, the drinker can read the patterns in the leaves remaining at the bottom of her cup, gaining the benefits of an _ [augury](spells/augury#_augury)_ spell.

Additionally, the unbrewed tea can be used as an extra material component when casting _ [augury](spells/augury#_augury)_, removing the need for a focus. In this case, the caster instead reveals information as if she had cast _ [divination](spells/divination#_divination)_ instead.

Sheath of Bladestealth

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This mundane-looking but serviceable sheath fits any bladed slashing weapon, from a dagger to a greatsword. When a weapon is placed into the _sheath of bladestealth_, both it and the weapon become invisible (as the _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_ spell) until the weapon is drawn, at which point it and the sheath become visible again. The invisible sheathed weapon can still be detected by touch, but the bearer gains a +5 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand#_sleight-of-hand) checks to conceal the weapon, and casual inspection does not reveal it at all. Other effects that detect or reveal invisible things work normally on the sheathed weapon.

Singing Bell of Striking

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This simple bowl-shaped bell made of either cold iron or silver is played by rubbing a leather mallet along its rim, creating a ringing sound. By playing the bell while meditating or resting to regain _ki_, the bearer may attune his _ki_ points to the instrument. Once attuned, the bearer's _ki_ strikes count as cold iron (if the bell is cold iron) or silver (if the bell is silver) instead of magic for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. This lasts until the next time the bearer rests or meditates to regain _ki_ points. A creature can only be attuned to one singing bell at a time, and a singing bell can only be attuned to one person at a time. Only creatures whose _ki_ strikes normally act as magic weapons can use a _singing bell of striking_.

This crystalline carving looks like a hand-sized tree leaf. It is usually worn around the neck on a strap so it is within easy reach, but can be affixed to a belt or clothing just like a badge. Activating a _snapleaf_ is an immediate action and gives the bearer the benefits of _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall#_feather-fall)_ and _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_. The duration of the two effects work independently; ending one early does not affect the other. The item cannot be activated to provide just one of these two effects; they are always activated simultaneously.

This small bar of coarse gray soap has tiny pieces of ash, coal, or hard earth embedded in it, leaving anyone washed with it as dirty as before. Washing a creature with the soap requires water and takes 1 minute, after which the creature can attempt a new Will saving throw against any hostile ongoing mind-affecting effect currently affecting it. Unwilling creatures must be pinned or otherwise made helpless before they can be washed. The soap is sufficient to wash one creature.

Sovereign Glue

**Price** 2,400 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 20th; **Weight** —

This pale amber substance is thick and viscous. Because of its particular powers, it can be contained only in a flask whose inside has been coated with 1 ounce of _salve of slipperiness_, and each time any of the bonding agent is poured from the flask, a new application of the _salve of slipperiness_ must be put in the flask within 1 round to prevent the remaining glue from adhering to the side of the container. A flask of _sovereign glue_, when found, holds anywhere from 1 to 7 ounces of the stuff (1d8–1, minimum 1), with the other ounce of the flask's capacity taken up by the _salve of slipperiness_. One ounce of this adhesive covers 1 square foot of surface, bonding virtually any two substances together in a permanent union. The glue takes 1 round to set. If the objects are pulled apart (a move action) before that time has elapsed, that application of the glue loses its stickiness and is worthless. If the glue is allowed to set, then attempting to separate the two bonded objects has no effect, except when _universal solvent_ is applied to the bond. _Sovereign glue_ is dissolved by _universal solvent_.

The price and creation cost given are per ounce.

Steadfast Gut-Stone

**Price** 800 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This fist sized chunk of off-white stone seems too large to fit inside a human's mouth, but may be swallowed with ease as a standard action. Once ingested, the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack, as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0.

When a gut-stone is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of damage.

Only one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round. If a gut-stone is not used within a week of being swallowed or is destroyed it crumbles apart and is passed harmlessly out of the body.

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This life-sized carving of a Tiny animal is crafted from dark, rough stone. It has a hardness of 8 and 20 hit points. A witch can use the _stone familiar_ to store up to 500 levels of spells (cantrips count as 1/2 level for this purpose). A witch can use the _stone familiar_ to teach her living familiar any spells stored in it, and vice versa. A witch who identifies a _stone familiar _immediately knows what spells are stored inside it. A _stone familiar_ is never found as randomly generated treasure with spells already stored in it.

Stone Horse

**Price** varies; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 14th; **Weight** 6,000 lbs.

**Courser** 10,000 gp; **Destrier** 14,800 gp

This item is a roughly hewn statue of a horse, carved from some type of hard stone. A command word brings the steed to life, enabling it to carry a burden and even to attack as if it were a real horse of the appropriate kind. A _stone horse_ is combat-trained.

A _stone horse_ can carry 1,000 pounds tirelessly and never needs to rest or eat. Damage dealt to it can be repaired either by feeding it gems (1 hp for every 50 gp value of the gem) or by casting _ [stone to flesh](spells/stoneToFlesh#_stone-to-flesh)_, then using healing spells until it reaches its maximum hit points, at which time it automatically returns to its stone form.

There are two sorts of _stone horses_.

_Courser_: This item has the statistics of a horse with hardness 10.

_Destrier_: This item has the statistics of a heavy horse with hardness 10.

This stone cube, when given the command word, affixes itself to any object. If that object is touched thereafter by anyone who does not first speak that same command word, the stone emits a piercing screech for 1 hour that can be heard up to a quarter-mile away (assuming no intervening barriers).

Stone of Alliance

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

This tiny sphere of marble can be used to strengthen an existing link between the user and a creature bound to him. When activated by a creature and then swallowed by that creature's animal companion, bonded mount, or familiar, the stone magically remains inside the companion creature. Thereafter, the master is continually aware of the companion's distance, direction, and general condition as if using the spell _ [status](spells/status#_status)_. If the master has line of sight to the companion, he may as an immediate action protect the creature from being harmed by one successful attack, taking the full effect of that attack instead.

Once per day the master may spend a standard action to transfer the blinded, dazzled, deafened, fatigued, shaken, or sickened condition from the companion to himself. Alternatively, the master may partially transfer the exhausted, frightened, or nauseated condition from the companion to himself, with he and the companion both suffering the lesser version of that condition (fatigued for exhausted, and so on). The master must be within 30 feet of the companion for him to use either aspect of this ability.

The stone remains harmlessly inside the companion until it dies, the master dies, or the master dismisses the companion, at which point it crumbles into a worthless powder and is digested.

**Price** 90,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 11th; **Weight** lbs.

A stone of this nature is typically an oddly shaped bit of roughly polished rock. On command as a full-round action, the bearer may summon an earth elemental. If there is an unbroken piece of unworked stone of at least Huge size nearby, the stone conjures a Huge earth elemental as if using _ [summon monster VI](spells/summonMonster#_summon-monster-vi)_. If there is no such stone available (for example, if there is only sand, earth, worked stone, or smaller pieces of stone), the stone conjures a Large earth elemental as if using _ [summon monster V](spells/summonMonster#_summon-monster-v)_. The stone cannot summon another elemental until the previous one is dismissed, killed, or the duration of its summoning expires.

Strand of Prayer Beads

**Price** varies; **Aura** Varies; **CL** Varies; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

**Lesser strand** 9,600 gp; **Standard strand** 45,800 gp; **Greater strand** 95,800 gp

This item appears to be nothing more than a string of prayer beads until the owner casts a divine spell while the beads are carried. Once that occurs, the owner instantly knows the powers of the prayer beads and understands how to activate the strand's special magical beads. Each strand includes two or more special beads, each with a different magic power selected from the following list.

| Special Bead Type | Special Bead Ability |
| --- | --- |
| Bead of blessing (CL 1st) | Wearer can cast _ [bless](spells/bless#_bless)_. |
| Bead of healing (CL 5th) | Wearer can cast his choice of _ [cure serious wounds](spells/cureSeriousWounds#_cure-serious-wounds)_, _remove [blindness/deafness](spells/blindnessDeafness#_blindness-deafness)_, or _remove disease_. |
| Bead of karma (CL 9th) | Wearer casts his spells at +4 caster level. Effect lasts 10 minutes. |
| Bead of smiting (CL 7th) | Wearer can cast _ [chaos hammer](spells/chaosHammer#_chaos-hammer)_, _ [holy smite](spells/holySmite#_holy-smite)_, _ [order's wrath](spells/orderSWrath#_order-s-wrath)_, or _ [unholy blight](spells/unholyBlight#_unholy-blight)_ (Will DC 17 partial). |
| Bead of summons (CL 17th) | Summons a powerful creature of appropriate alignment from the Outer Planes (an angel, devil, etc.) to aid the wearer for 1 day. (If the wearer uses the bead of summons to summon a deity's emissary frivolously, the deity takes that character's items and places a _geas_ upon him as punishment at the very least.) |
| Bead of wind walking (CL 11th) | Wearer can cast _ [wind walk](spells/windWalk#_wind-walk)_. |

A _lesser [strand of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_strand-of-prayer-beads) [prayer](spells/prayer#_prayer) beads_ has a bead of blessing and a bead of healing. A _ [strand of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_strand-of-prayer-beads) [prayer](spells/prayer#_prayer) beads_ has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, and a bead of smiting. A _greater [strand of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_strand-of-prayer-beads) [prayer](spells/prayer#_prayer) beads_ has a bead of healing, a bead of karma, a bead of summons, and a bead of wind walking.

Each special bead can be used once per day, except for the bead of summons, which works only once and then becomes nonmagical. The beads of blessing, smiting, and wind walking function as spell trigger items; the beads of karma and summons can be activated by any character capable of casting divine spells. The owner need not hold or wear the _ [strand of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_strand-of-prayer-beads) [prayer](spells/prayer#_prayer) beads_ in any specific location, as long as he carries it somewhere on his person.

The power of a special bead is lost if it is removed from the strand. Reduce the price of a _ [strand of](magicItems/wondrousItems#_strand-of-prayer-beads) [prayer](spells/prayer#_prayer) beads _that is missing one or more beads by the following amounts: bead of blessing –600 gp, bead of healing –9,000 gp, bead of karma –20,000 gp, bead of smiting –16,800 gp, bead of summons –20,000 gp, bead of wind walking –46,800 gp.

Stubborn Nail

**Price** 100 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This adamantine piton is 6 inches long. As a standard action, the bearer may push the nail by hand into any non-living material, including metal, stone, or wood. The bearer may push it through more than one item at a time, so long as the total thickness is not greater than the length of the nail. Once pushed into place, the nail is held firmly as if it had been hammered there (a DC 20 Strength check to remove it), although the creature who put it there can remove it as a move action. Once removed, the nail leaves no hole or other sign of its presence. The nail can support 500 pounds. If used to hold a door shut, increase the break DC of the door by +2. If pressed into a lock, the lock cannot be opened until the nail is removed. Once removed, the nail loses all its powers and transforms into a nonmagical iron piton.

Summoning Shackle

**Price** 5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 11th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This small silver shackle is carved with conjuration runes. When used as a focus as part of a summoning spell of 3rd level or less, it creates a faintly-glowing intangible magical chain from the caster to the summoned creature or creatures. The duration of that summoning spell is extended as if using the [Extend Spell](feats#_extend-spell) feat, with no increase in casting time. The chain prevents the creature from moving more than 30 feet from the caster, even when using teleportation (though the caster can use these effects to exceed this distance, which ends the shackling effect immediately). The chain does not otherwise obstruct or interfere with any object or creature other than the summoned creature. The shackle may be used up to five times per day. If the shackle or the chain is dispelled, the range limitation and increased duration ends; if the spell's unmodified duration would already have ended by then, the spell ends immediately.

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

This thumb-sized crystalline skull is carved with necromantic runes. Once per day, a spellcaster can grasp the stone while casting a summoning spell. When the spellcasting is finished, the caster may immediately attempt to possess the summoned creature, as if using _ [magic jar](spells/magicJar#_magic-jar)_, except as a free action. The creature does not get a saving throw to resist, though spell resistance still applies. If successful, the caster possesses the creatures' body until the duration of the summoning spell ends, at which time his mind returns to his body, the creature's mind returns to its body, and the creature disappears.

If this seemingly unremarkable utensil is placed in an empty container, the vessel fills with a thick, pasty gruel. Although the gruel tastes like warm, wet cardboard, it is highly nourishing and contains everything necessary to sustain any herbivorous, omnivorous, or carnivorous creature. The spoon can produce sufficient gruel each day to feed up to four humans.

Traveler's Any-Tool

**Price** 250 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This implement at first seems to be nothing but a 12-inch iron bar lined with small plates and spikes. It can be folded, twisted, hinged, and bent, to form almost any known tool. Hammers, shovels, even a block and tackle (without rope) are possible. It can duplicate any tool the wielder can clearly visualize that contains only limited moving parts, such as a pair of scissors, but not a handloom. It cannot be used to replace missing or broken parts of machines or vehicles unless a mundane tool would have done the job just as well.

The any-tool counts as a set of masterwork artisan's tools for most [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) or [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) skills (although very specialist crafts such as alchemy still require their own unique toolset). It is an ineffective weapon, always counting as an improvised weapon and never granting any masterwork bonus on attack rolls.

Treasurer's Seal

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

Six inches in diameter, one side of this porcelain seal shows a many-keyholed padlock, while the other displays a lightning bolt superimposed on an open hand. The padlock side is used to lock and alarm doors, chests, and other portals. The bearer may speak a command word to activate it when holding it against a lockable item. If the padlock side of the seal is touching the item, it bestows an _ [alarm](spells/alarm#_alarm)_ (mental alarm) and _ [arcane lock](spells/arcaneLock#_arcane-lock)_ on the target item. If the lightning bolt side of the seal is touching the item, it casts _ [fire trap](spells/fireTrap#_fire-trap)_ on the lock (the seal must be held to the lock for 10 minutes to use this ability).

A creature carrying the seal can speak a command word to suspend its effects on an item for 1 minute. This ability is usable at will, but only works on effects created by that specific seal.

The seal can be used at will but can only maintain effects on three items at any given time. Using it on a fourth item automatically negates the oldest effect.

Unguent of Timelessness

**Price** 150 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

When applied to any matter that was once alive, such as wood, paper, or a dead body, this ointment allows that substance to resist the passage of time. Each year of actual time affects the substance as if only a day had passed. The coated object gains a +1 resistance bonus on all saving throws. The unguent never wears off, although it can be magically removed (by dispelling the effect, for instance). One flask contains enough material to coat eight Medium or smaller objects. A Large object counts as two Medium objects, and a Huge object counts as four Medium objects.

Infused with the essence of destruction, a pinch of void dust unmakes force effects. If sprinkled on or thrown at a force effect, it acts as a _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_, unless the force effect is immune to _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_, in which case it acts like _ [disintegrate](spells/disintegrate#_disintegrate)_. _Void dust_ can be sprinkled on an adjacent force effect or thrown up to 10 feet.

Void Pennant

**Price** 14,000 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This long tapering pennant resembles a stylized serpentine figure wearing a shimmering crown. The figure's claws function as clasps, attaching it to a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. The pennant has no effect when not mounted properly, or when activated by a lawfully aligned creature.

Planting the pennant in the ground generates an area of twisted space around the flag out to a range of 30 feet. Any creature that teleports into or out of this area is nauseated for 1 round (a DC 18 Fortitude save reduces this penalty to sickened). Any creature may end the effect by uprooting the pennant as a standard action. The pennant functions for 10 rounds per day. These rounds do not need to be consecutive.

**1st-level** 2,200 gp; **2nd-level** 3,000 gp; **3rd-level** 3,800 gp

This lime green pill is inedible but turns a potion into a cloud of mist that can be shared by multiple creatures. When placed inside a potion flask, the potion bubbles and froths itself into a pungent 10-foot-radius cloud. Any creature within the cloud when it appears gains the full effect of the potion. The cloud has no effect on creatures that cannot breathe. A creature may automatically resist the effects of the potion cloud by momentarily holding its breath. Using the pill destroys it and the potion. Each pill can only be used on potions of a particular spell level; using it on a potion of a different spell level has no effect (neither the potion nor the pill are consumed). The vaporizer also works on alchemist infusions, but not mutagens, extracts, or magical oils.

War Paint of the Terrible Visage

**Price** 100 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 1st; **Weight** —

This thimble-sized clay container of thick, moist face paint has enough material to paint streaks and whorls of any color on one creature's face. Once applied, the wearer can, as a swift action, make the paint rearrange itself into a ghastly mélange of colors, making her appearance momentarily disturbing and hideous. The wearer chooses one creature who can see her painted face within 30 feet to be affected by _ [cause fear](spells/causeFear#_cause-fear)_ (DC 11). Once the paint is used in this fashion, it loses all magic and becomes normal face paint. Once applied, the wearer has 24 hours to use the paint's magic; otherwise it fades away.

Wasp Nest of Swarming

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This is a hand-sized replica of a wasp's nest, crafted out of paper. It is extremely fragile and comes in a snug rigid case. If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after being released.

Waters of Transfiguration

**Price** 12,500 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This small lacquered box made from exotic and colorful woods contains five vials and a single dropper. The vials are labeled "glass," "iron," "paper," "stone," and "wood," and each contains a magical fluid that permanently transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked "paper" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid. Magical and attended objects may resist this transformation with a successful DC 17 Fortitude save.

**Price** 82,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** —

This strange, interdimensional device looks just like a _portable hole_. Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world—a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a _portable hole_ can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily—it is a two-way portal.

A _wind fan_ appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to duplicate a _ [gust of wind](spells/gustOfWind#_gust-of-wind)_ spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk.

Word Bottle

**Price** 1,500 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle.

The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).
