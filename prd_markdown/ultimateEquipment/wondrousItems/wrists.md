The keyed individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and the _bracelet of friends_ only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.

In addition, the holder of the manacles' key can cast command (DC 25 Will) on the wearer of the shackles three times per day. 

_Shackles of compliance_ have hardness 10 and 10 hit points, and a DC 30 [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) check is required to pick the shackles' lock.

Removing or destroying the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The shackles can be so used once per day. _Shackles of durance vile_ can only be activated against a helpless, restrained, or willing creature; if attached to a creature still able to resist they function only as manacles, albeit superior ones. _Shackles of durance vile_ have hardness 15, 20 hit points, and a superior lock.

Vambraces of the Tactician

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

These vambraces change their appearance depending on who wears them. If the wearer is a cavalier, these vambraces display the symbol of his order. When unworn or in the hands of a non-cavalier, they appear to be an ordinary pair of steel vambraces. A cavalier wearing these vambraces is considered two class levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his challenge class feature. Furthermore, once per day as a swift action, a cavalier with the tactician class feature can increase the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end of his next turn, when the cavalier grants his allies a teamwork feat, he can grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they must still be able to see and hear him.

Verdant Vine

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

Consisting of a vine with five green berries, a _verdant vine_ is worn tied around the wrist. Once per day on command, the wearer can pinch a berry off the vine, and throw it up to 30 feet away, like a splash weapon. Viciously thorny vines erupt in a 20-foot radius from the point of impact, even if the berry misses its target. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or become entangled, as the spell _ [entangle](spells/entangle.md#_entangle)_, as the vines coil around the creature's legs. The vines persist, but at the start of the affected creature's turn, it gains a new saving throw against the effect. If the affected creature fails the saving throw, it also takes 1d4 points of damage.

A DC 20 Strength check, made as a standard action, allows an affected creature to break free and end the effect. Failing the check causes the vines to constrict, dealing 1d4 points of damage.
