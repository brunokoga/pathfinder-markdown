The keyed individual knows who is attempting to teleport him, and the _bracelet of friends_ only functions on willing travelers. Once a charm is activated, it disappears. Charms separated from the bracelet are worthless. A bracelet found with fewer than four charms is worth 25% less for each missing charm.

This slender silver bracelet is worked in an intertwined design of three flowers. A DC 20 [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) (nature) check identifies the flowers as acacia, apocynum, and bilberry, symbolizing concealment, treachery, and falsehood.

The bracelet grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) checks, and a +5 resistance bonus on Will saves against enchantment effects. If the wearer makes a successful Will save against an enchantment, the caster of that spell incorrectly senses the effect has succeeded. Additionally, the bracelet's wearer knows an enchantment targeted him and the enchantment's source. _Seducer's [bane](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-bane)_ creates an aura on its wearer, visible to _ [detect magic](spells/detectMagic#_detect-magic)_, matching the failed enchantment spell or effect, and lasting as long as the intended enchantment's duration. However, if the bracelet's wearer attacks the caster or its allies, or otherwise acts in a way that's contradictory to the failed spell's effect, the caster of that spell immediately realizes the enchantment was ineffective.

A creature wearing shackles of compliance becomes more susceptible to intimidation. Any creature attempting to intimidate or demoralize a target wearing shackles of compliance gains a +4 bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) checks. In addition, the holder of the manacles' key can cast command (DC 25 Will) on the wearer of the shackles three times per day. 

_Shackles of compliance_ have hardness 10 and 10 hit points, and a DC 30 [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice#_disable-device) check is required to pick the shackles' lock.

When they are attached to a humanoid creature as their command word is spoken, they affect their prisoner with a _ [dominate person](spells/dominatePerson#_dominate-person)_ spell, except that if the prisoner fails its saving throw, the effect lasts for as long as the shackles are attached. Removing or destroying the shackles immediately breaks the enchantment. The shackles can be so used once per day. _Shackles of durance vile_ can only be activated against a helpless, restrained, or willing creature; if attached to a creature still able to resist they function only as manacles, albeit superior ones. _Shackles of durance vile_ have hardness 15, 20 hit points, and a superior lock.

Vambraces of the Tactician

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

These vambraces change their appearance depending on who wears them. If the wearer is a cavalier, these vambraces display the symbol of his order. When unworn or in the hands of a non-cavalier, they appear to be an ordinary pair of steel vambraces. A cavalier wearing these vambraces is considered two class levels higher for purposes of determining the effects of his challenge class feature. Furthermore, once per day as a swift action, a cavalier with the tactician class feature can increase the area in which he grants teamwork feats. Before the end of his next turn, when the cavalier grants his allies a teamwork feat, he can grant it to all allies within 60 feet, though they must still be able to see and hear him.

Verdant Vine

**Price** 6,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

Consisting of a vine with five green berries, a _verdant vine_ is worn tied around the wrist. Once per day on command, the wearer can pinch a berry off the vine, and throw it up to 30 feet away, like a splash weapon. Viciously thorny vines erupt in a 20-foot radius from the point of impact, even if the berry misses its target. Creatures within the area must succeed at a DC 16 Reflex saving throw or become entangled, as the spell _ [entangle](spells/entangle#_entangle)_, as the vines coil around the creature's legs. The vines persist, but at the start of the affected creature's turn, it gains a new saving throw against the effect. If the affected creature fails the saving throw, it also takes 1d4 points of damage.

A DC 20 Strength check, made as a standard action, allows an affected creature to break free and end the effect. Failing the check causes the vines to constrict, dealing 1d4 points of damage.
