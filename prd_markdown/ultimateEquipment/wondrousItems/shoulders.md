Cape of Effulgent Escape

**Price** 14,000 gp; **Aura** faint evocation and illusion; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 1 lb.

This shining white cloak is trimmed with golden sunbursts and continuously radiates light (as per the _ [light](spells/light.md#_light) _spell, but only in a 10-foot radius). Twice per day, the wearer can command the cape to erupt in a burst of light, blinding all creatures other than the wearer within 20 feet for 1d4 rounds (Reflex DC 14 negates). After triggering this burst, the wearer becomes invisible (as the _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_ spell, with a duration of 1 minute) and the cape's light is extinguished as long as the wearer is invisible.

Once per day on command, this bright red and gold cape allows the wearer to use the magic of the _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor.md#_dimension-door)_ spell. When he disappears, he leaves behind a cloud of harmless gray smoke, appearing in a similar dramatic fashion at his destination.

Catching Cape

**Price** 200 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 1st; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This silvery cape furls and ripples like a flag with every step its owner takes. As a swift action, the wearer can order the cape to transform into a faint sphere of force that surrounds him on all sides. The field grants the wearer concealment (20% miss chance) against ranged attacks and lasts for 1 minute or until the wearer is missed by a ranged attack due to the power of the cloak, whichever comes first.

**Price** 50,000 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Embroidered with images of falling stars and pale moons, this item appears to be a normal cloak, but on command its magical properties distort and warp light waves.

This item appears to be a normal cloak, with a pattern very similar to a _major cloak of [displacement](spells/displacement.md#_displacement) _nocturnal designs, but when worn its magical properties distort and warp light waves. This displacement works similar to the _ [blur](spells/blur.md#_blur)_ spell, granting a 20% miss chance on attacks against the wearer. It functions continually.

Cloak of Etherealness

**Price** 55,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This silvery gray cloak seems to absorb light rather than be illuminated by it. On command, the cloak makes its wearer ethereal (as the _ [ethereal jaunt](spells/etherealJaunt.md#_ethereal-jaunt)_ spell). The effect is dismissible. The cloak works for a total of up to 10 minutes per day. This duration need not be continuous, but it must be used in 1 minute increments.

The oversized teeth last for 1 round, during which time the wearer can make a bite attack. Treat this attack as a primary natural attack that deals 1d6 points of damage (or 1d4 if the wearer is Small). If the wearer already has a bite attack, the damage of that bite attack increases by one step (_Bestiary _302).

**Price** 2,600 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration and illusion; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This thick leather cloak is charred and blackened around the edges and smells faintly of soot. Once per day, when subject to an effect that deals fire damage, the wearer can spend an immediate action while obscured by the flames to become invisible, leaving behind an illusory pile of ashes and bones, as if he had been slain by the fire effect. The wearer's invisibility and his illusory remains last for 5 rounds or until the wearer attacks any creature. Creatures that study or interact with the ashes can make a DC 11 Will save to disbelieve the illusion, though this does not end the invisibility effect.

Cost 1,300 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_, _ [silent image](spells/silentImage.md#_silent-image)_

Cloak of Human Guise

**Price** 900 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 1st; **Weight** 1 lb.

This plain cloak only has any effect when worn by a member of a half-human race, such as a half-orc or half-elf. It alters the wearer's appearance similarly to a _hat of disguise_, but only to the extent that it conceals or alters the wearer's non-human physical traits so the creature appears fully human. Any feature that is plausibly human remains. For example, a half-orc wearing the cloak loses his green or gray skin color and pointed ears, has no visible tusks, and is otherwise completely able to pass as a human version of his normal self. Likewise, a half-elf wearing the cloak has round ears, humanlike eyes, and no other traits indicating elven ancestry. The wearer has no control over the specific guise, and those familiar with his normal appearance can recognize him in his human guise.

Construction Requirements

Cost 450 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [disguise self](spells/disguiseSelf.md#_disguise-self)_

Construction Requirements

**+1 bonus** 500 gp; **+2 bonus** 2,000 gp; **+3 bonus** 4,500 gp; **+4 bonus** 8,000 gp; **+5 bonus** 12,500 gp

Cloak of the Bat

**Price** 26,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Fashioned of dark brown or black cloth, this cloak bestows a +5 competence bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks. The wearer is also able to hang upside down from the ceiling like a bat.

By holding the edges of the garment, the wearer is able to fly as per the spell (including a +7 bonus on [Fly](skills/fly.md#_fly) skill checks). If he desires, the wearer can actually polymorph himself into an ordinary bat and fly accordingly (as _ [beast shape III](spells/beastShape.md#_beast-shape-iii)_). All possessions worn or carried are part of the transformation. Flying, either with the cloak or in bat form, can be accomplished only in darkness (either under the night sky or in a lightless or near-lightless environment underground). Either of the flying powers is usable for up to 7 minutes at a time, but after a flight of any duration the cloak cannot bestow any flying power for a like period of time.

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 1 lb.

The forest-green cloak grants a +5 competence bonus on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) checks. In addition, once per day, before making a [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) or [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) check, the wearer can decide to call upon the powers of the cloak to roll twice and take the better result. Finally, the wearer of this cloak can adjust a creature's attitude up to three steps when using [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy), instead of the normal limit of two steps. However, the cloak's power does have one drawback. Should the wearer ever fail a [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) checks made to adjust a creature's attitude by 5 or more, the creature's attitude is reduced by two steps instead of one.

Construction Requirements

Cost 10,000 gp

This ruffled silk cloak is incredibly durable despite its soft, delicate construction. Anytime the wearer falls asleep (whether the sleep is natural or brought on by a magical effect), the cloak immediately transforms into sticky strands that envelop the wearer's body, hardening into a solid silk cocoon. While wrapped in the cocoon the wearer gains a +4 enhancement bonus to natural armor and is protected from critical hits and sneak attacks as if subject to the _ [light](spells/light.md#_light) [fortification](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-fortification)_ armor ability (25% chance for normal damage on a critical hit).

Cowardly Crouching Cloak

**Price** 1,800 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration ; **CL** 1st; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This nondescript gray cloak has a hood that can fit over the wearer's entire face. The wearer can, as a move action, cover his face and drop to a huddling crouch. Any creature seeking to directly attack him while he does this must make a DC 11 Will save to do so (as the _ [sanctuary](spells/sanctuary.md#_sanctuary)_ spell). The wearer cannot see or take any actions while crouching. This makes him effectively blind, with all the normal penalties, but not helpless.

Large eagle feathers decorate the back and arms of this magnificent cape. Should the cape's wearer fall more than 5 feet, the cape spreads out behind the wearer and she gently drifts to the ground. This acts exactly like a _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_ spell for the wearer only. Once per day, if the wearer grasps the edges of the cape and spreads her arms, she transforms into an eagle (as per the _ [beast shape I](spells/beastShape.md#_beast-shape-i)_ spell, except that it allows only eagle form and the wearer gains the eagle's full fly speed of 80 feet).
