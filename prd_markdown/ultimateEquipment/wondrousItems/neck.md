Aegis of Recovery

**Price** 1,500 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration and conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

An _aegis of recovery_ grants its wearer a +2 resistance bonus on all saving throws made to recover from a continuing effect, such as ongoing poison damage, daily saving throws against a disease, a _ [hold person](spells/holdPerson.md#_hold-person)_ spell, or lingering damage from an attack. This bonus does not help against initial saving throws against such effects. Should the wearer ever drop below 0 hit points, the aegis heals the wearer for 2d8+3 points of damage and then crumbles to dust.

Ampoule of False Blood

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** —

This necklace consists of a fine gold chain from which hangs a small sealed crystal vial containing preserved liquid blood. Each ampoule is attuned to a specific sorcerer bloodline. If a sorcerer (or other creature with sorcerer bloodline powers, such as from the [Eldritch Heritage](ultimateMagic/ultimateMagicFeats.md#_eldritch-heritage) feat) wears the ampoule for at least one day, she loses her existing bloodline powers and gains the bloodline powers of the ampoule's bloodline, using her sorcerer level to determine the powers gained. The ampoule has no effect on the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, or bonus feats from her original bloodline (which remain unchanged).

The sorcerer can only use these bloodline powers as long as she wears the necklace. Removing the necklace leaves the sorcerer unable to access any bloodline power, either her own or those of the ampoule, until one hour has passed.

As a full round action that provokes an attack of opportunity, the wearer can break open the ampoule and drink the blood within. This destroys the item, and gives her the sickened condition for 1d4 hours. If the drinker is a sorcerer, her bloodline permanently changes to match that of the ampoule. In this case, the sorcerer's bonus spells, bloodline arcana, and bloodline powers all permanently change to match those of the ampoule's bloodline. Bonus feats previously selected due to the sorcerer's bloodline are unaffected, but new feats must be selected from the new bloodline's bonus feat list.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 10,000 gp

Amulet of Elemental Strife

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This amulet shines brightly when brought within 60 feet of an outsider with the elemental subtype, shedding light as a torch. The amulet glows a different color depending on the subtype of the elemental or elementals present (white for air, yellow for earth, red for fire, and blue for water). If more than one subtype is present, the gem flickers back and forth between the appropriate colors.

The wearer gains resistance 5 against a single energy type determined by the subtype of the closest elemental present (air grants electricity resistance, earth grants acid resistance, fire grants fire resistance, and water grants cold resistance). If the closest elemental possesses multiple subtypes, the wearer may choose which type of resistance she gains. This energy resistance only applies against attacks from elementals. The amulet also allows any attacks made by the wearer to bypass the damage reduction of such creatures.

Construction Requirements

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [resist energy](spells/resistEnergy.md#_resist-energy)_, creator must be at least 8th level

Amulet of Hidden Strength

**Price** 9,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This glass teardrop hangs on a platinum chain and can be used once per day to grant a surge of power. This surge can be used in one of two ways. As a swift action, the wearer of the amulet can make one melee or ranged attack at his highest attack bonus. Alternatively, if the wearer of the amulet has a _ki_ pool, he can instead focus on the power of the amulet as a full-round action and regain two _ki_ points.

Amulet of Magecraft

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** moderate universal; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

A universalist wizard who selects the amulet as his bonded object may choose one school of spells each day when he prepares spells. He then can use the necklace to spontaneously convert any prepared wizard spell of that school into any other wizard spell of that school he knows—though the desired spell must be of the same level or lower than the prepared spell. For example, if the wizard chooses evocation when he prepares his spells that morning, until the next time he prepares spells, he can spontaneously convert a prepared _ [fireball](spells/fireball.md#_fireball)_ into any other evocation wizard spell of 3rd level or lower that he knows.

Alternatively, this amulet can grant melee weapon special abilities, so long as they can be applied to unarmed attacks. See Table: Melee Weapon Special Abilities for a list of abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses. An _amulet of mighty fists_ cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +5. An amulet of mighty fists does not need to have a +1 enhancement bonus to grant a melee weapon special ability.

Construction Requirements

Amulet of Proof against Detection and Location

**Price** 35,000 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

This silver amulet protects the wearer from scrying and magical location just as a _ [nondetection](spells/nondetection.md#_nondetection)_ spell does. If a divination spell is attempted against the wearer, the caster of the divination must succeed on a caster level check (1d20 + caster level) against a DC of 19 (as if the wearer had cast _ [nondetection](spells/nondetection.md#_nondetection)_ on herself).

Amulet of the Planes

**Price** 120,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th; **Weight** —

This device usually appears to be a black circular amulet, although any character looking closely at it sees a dark, moving swirl of color. The amulet allows its wearer to utilize the spell _ [plane shift](spells/planeShift.md#_plane-shift)_. However, this is a difficult item to master. The user must make a DC 15 Intelligence check in order to get the amulet to take her to the plane (and the specific location on that plane) that she desires. If she fails, the amulet transports her and all those traveling with her to a random location on that plane (01–60 on d%) or to a random plane (61–100).

This copper clasp adorned with a piece of amber is used to fasten a cloak or cape. When its wearer takes electricity damage, this brooch absorbs up to 20 points of electrical damage and holds that electrical charged until it is released by its wielder or harmlessly at the end of 10 minutes, whichever occurs first. The brooch can absorb up to 50 points of electricity damage per day. The wielder can release the charge on command, unleashing any electricity in the brooch as if casting a _ [shocking grasp](spells/shockingGrasp.md#_shocking-grasp)_ spell (dealing 1d6 points of electricity damage per 5 points of damage held).

Carcanet of Detention

**Price** 7,200 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 4th; **Weight** —

Comprised of thick iron links, the _carcanet of detention_ is commonly worn by prison guards and elite members of the city watch. Once per day, the wearer of the carcanet may command it to animate and attempt to wrap around one Medium or smaller creature within 15 feet. The target receives a DC 15 Reflex saving throw to avoid the chain. If the saving throw fails, the target is entangled and cannot move from its current location. As a full-round action, the target can attempt a new saving throw to end the effect; otherwise it persists for 10 minutes or until ended by the wearer as a swift action, at which point it returns to its carcanet form. The chain has a hardness of 10 and 15 hit points.

Collar of the True Companion

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Although it appears to be a simple thong of leather, this collar was initially conceived by druids who believed that there were animals who possessed spirits worthy of elevation to true sentience. If worn by a creature of the animal type with an Intelligence less than 3, a _collar of the true companion_ grants a +2 enhancement bonus to Intelligence. This does not give the animal the ability to speak, but it does allow it to understand one spoken language (chosen by the item's creator).

If the collar is worn for at least 1 week by a creature of the animal type, the creature is raised to humanlike sentience, as though by the _ [awaken](spells/awaken.md#_awaken) _spell. Once this occurs, the collar loses its magical properties.

If a _collar of the true companion_ is worn for more than 1 week by a creature not of the animal type, the wearer is _feebleminded_ until the collar is removed.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 6,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [awaken](spells/awaken.md#_awaken)_, _ [fox's cunning](spells/foxSCunning.md#_fox-s-cunning)_

Crystal of Healing Hands

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

A cloth cord marked with esoteric religious symbols typically holds this roughly cut, glittering prism in place. A person with the lay on hands class feature can direct one use of this energy into the crystal, which stores it until the wearer speaks a command word to release it. Releasing the energy targets the wearer with the stored lay on hands effect, as if touched by the person who infused the crystal with its power. The crystal can contain a single use of the lay on hands class feature. When filled with this magic, it begins to glow with a pearly white light. The wearer of the crystal can order it to release its energy as a standard action. This acts identically to receiving the effect of lay on hands directly from the person who channeled it into the crystal, including any mercies they had at the time.

**Cost** 6,000 gp

Craft Wondrous Item, _ [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_, creator must be a paladin

Dragonfoe Amulet

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This amulet consists of a cracked dragon scale set in a disk of gold. Most are slightly damaged, bearing the scars of draconic breath weapons. The _dragonfoe amulet_ is a powerful, specialized tool for those who oppose dragons, improving the protection and attacks of the wearer in a number of ways.

The wearer of a _dragonfoe amulet_ ignores the damage reduction of dragons. This only affects actual dragons, not all creatures of the dragon type. In addition, if the wearer casts a spell against a dragon, she can roll twice to overcome any spell resistance the dragon might possess, taking the higher result. Lastly, the wearer takes no damage instead of half damage on a successful Reflex save against a dragon's breath weapon (as the evasion ability).

Everwake Amulet

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 2nd; **Weight** 1 lb.

Cast in the image of the sun and often ornamented with an open eye, this amulet defends the wearer against the need for sleep. The wearer of this amulet does not need to sleep, but must remain at ease for the normal amount of time to regain spells and other abilities that require rest (although the wearer could perform light activity, such as reading or keeping watch). Once the wearer has used the power of this amulet for a total of seven nights, the amulet loses its power for one day and the wearer is exhausted for this duration. If the wearer removes the amulet for any reason after having used its ability, she becomes exhausted for four hours for every night of sleep skipped.

The wearer can read, speak, and understand the Gnome language. If the wearer is not a gnome, she gains low-light vision, and may cast _ [dancing lights](spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights), [ghost sound](spells/ghostSound.md#_ghost-sound), [prestidigitation](spells/prestidigitation.md#_prestidigitation)_, and _ [speak with animals](spells/speakWithAnimals.md#_speak-with-animals)_ each once per day as a spell-like ability.

Forge Fist Amulet

**Price** 13,000 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This fist-shaped stone amulet glows with a fiery light. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's fists to transform into red-hot flaming adamantine. The wearer is protected from the searing heat and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer make with his hands gain the _ [flaming](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming)_ weapon special ability and are treated as adamantine for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction (but not hardness). The wearer's hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by fire). The transformation can be ended as a swift action.

Frost Fist Amulet

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

Shaped like a fist, this iron amulet is surrounded by a frigid fog. On command, this amulet causes the wearer's hands to become encased in a layer of freezing iron. The wearer is protected from the frigid cold and can make savage blows with his hands. Unarmed strikes and natural attacks the wearer makes with hands gain the _ [frost](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-frost)_ weapon special ability and are treated as cold iron for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. The wearer's hands become rigid while using this amulet and cannot be use to hold or manipulate objects (unless that manipulation could be accomplished with a club and is not damaged by cold).

Golembane Scarab

**Price** 2,500 gp; **Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

This beetle-shaped pin enables its wearer to detect any golem within 60 feet, although he must concentrate (a standard action) in order for the detection to take place.

Favored by the grave-wardens of sites known to be infested with the spirits of the dead, this pendant is an iron ring strung on a necklace made from polished and discolored bones, nails, and teeth. A faint blue light limns the wearer, protecting him from attack. Undead creatures are repulsed by this light and take a –2 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer of a _gravewatch pendant_. Incorporeal undead creatures are further repulsed and instead take a –4 penalty on all attack rolls against the wearer. Undead creatures can sense this light easily, however, and receive a +4 circumstance bonus on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks to detect a creature wearing this pendant.

It provides a +2 armor bonus to AC (this does not stack with other armor bonuses) and grants the _ [light](spells/light.md#_light) [fortification](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-fortification)_ property to the wearer. In addition, the wearer may engrave a _ [glyph of warding](spells/glyphOfWarding.md#_glyph-of-warding)_ directly onto the _guardian gorget_. When the wearer is struck in melee, she can trigger the glyph as an immediate action, causing the glyph to discharge against the creature making the attack (and other creatures within 5 feet, if a blast glyph was placed, though the wearer is not harmed by the glyph‘s effects). The glyph can be triggered even if the attack would normally leave the wearer incapable of taking actions (such as killed, stunned, dazed, or knocked unconscious).

Hand of Glory

**Price** 8,000 gp; **Aura** faint varied; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This mummified human hand hangs around a character's neck by a leather cord (taking up space as a magic necklace would). If a magic ring is placed on one of the fingers of the hand, the wearer benefits from the ring as if wearing it herself, and it does not count against her two-ring limit. The hand can wear only one ring at a time. Even without a ring, the hand itself allows its wearer to use _ [daylight](spells/daylight.md#_daylight)_ and _ [see invisibility](spells/seeInvisibility.md#_see-invisibility)_ each once per day.

The surface of this silver medallion is covered in angular geometric shapes that refract light randomly. The medallion grants a continuous +2 resistance bonus on saves versus mind-affecting spells, spell-like abilities, and supernatural abilities. If the wearer fails a save to avoid becoming dominated or confused, the amulet immediately grants the wearer a second saving throw to resist the effect.

This necklace is a heavy chain with a platinum medallion.

Necklace of Fireballs

**Price** See Table; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This item appears to be a string or cluster of spherical beads, sometimes with the ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the strand as it really is—a golden chain from which hang a number of golden spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer), who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the end of its trajectory, it detonates as a _ [fireball](spells/fireball.md#_fireball)_ spell (Reflex DC 14 half).

Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6 points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6. The price of a sphere is 150 gp for each die of damage it deals.

Each necklace of fireballs contains a combination of spheres of various strengths. Some traditional combinations, designated types I through VII, are detailed above.

If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable consequences for the wearer.

Necklace of Netted Stars

**Price** 42,000 gp; **Aura** strong illusion and transmutation; **CL** 12th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This marvelous mithral necklace forms a broad, draping lacework of threadlike chains set with a multitude of tiny jewels. Seven of these jewels are larger than the rest. While wearing a _necklace of netted stars_, the wearer can create _ [dancing lights](spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights)_ at will and _ [wandering star motes](advanced/spells/wanderingStarMotes.md#_wandering-star-motes)_ once per day. In addition, each of the seven jewels of the necklace can recall a previously cast 1st-level or 0-level spell, as a _pearl of power_.

Once per day, the wearer may use the necklace to catch a spell targeted at him, as if readying an action to counterspell using _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic)_, with a bonus on the check equal to 12 + the number of jewels not yet used to recall spells that day. If all jewels have been used, this ability cannot be used that day. The level of the spell to be countered must be less than or equal to the number of unused jewels. If the counterspell succeeds, the spell is negated and the wearer can use its magical energy to recall a previously cast spell of the same level or lower as an immediate action. Whether or not the attempt succeeds, this action exhausts the power of all of the necklace's jewels for that day.

Periapt of Protection from Curses

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

While the wearer is using her divine powers of retribution (such as a cleric's smite, an inquisitor's smiting judgment, or a paladin's smite), the amulet grants her the ability to make unarmed strikes in melee combat as if she had the [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike) feat.

Stormlure

**Price** 5,400 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

A stormlure is usually fashioned from pieces of creatures known for their affinity to air—the feathers of birds, the shells of flying insects, and the scales of a dragon. When activated, stormlures call to the wind, causing a tempestuous gale. Once per day on command, the wearer of a stormlure is surrounding by swirling winds for 1 minute, granting a 50% miss chance against all ranged attacks, including rays and other ranged spells that require a roll to hit. This wind does not hinder the wearer of the _stormlure_ in any way. At any one time during this duration, as a swift action, the wearer can cause the air around her to fill with crackling lightning, dealing 4d6 points of electricity damage to all creatures adjacent to her. A DC 14 Reflex save halves this damage.

The wearer's weapons, unarmed attacks, and natural attacks deal full damage to swarms, regardless of the swarm's immunity to weapon damage (if any, although damage reduction applies as normal). If the wearer is damaged by a swarm, she automatically succeeds on her saving throw against the swarm's distraction ability.

Symbol of Sanguine Protection

**Price** 17,500 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 1 lb.

This silver holy symbol rests just over the wearer's heart, imbuing his blood with divine power. After wearing the amulet for 24 hours, the wearer can shed his own blood as a standard action, dealing 1d6 points of damage to himself, to collect an amount of divinely empowered blood that functions as a flask of holy water. The wearer can collect his blood this way once per day, but the individual vials lose their potency after just 1 week.

Undead creatures and evil outsiders that successfully use a blood drain attack on the wearer take 4d6 points of positive energy damage and are sickened for 1d4 rounds unless they make a DC 16 Will save. Any benefit the creature might gain from drinking the wearer's blood is negated due to the power of this symbol.

If the wearer is a barbarian of at least 12th level, she gains fearless rage as a bonus rage power.
