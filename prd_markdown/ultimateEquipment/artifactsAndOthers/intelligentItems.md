# Intelligent Items

Among the most miraculous of magic items are those that possess an intelligence of their own, those wondrous treasures that step beyond the realm of mere tools to true allies. Magically imbued with sentience, these items think and feel the same way characters do and warrant being treated like NPCs. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes. Only permanent magic items (as opposed to single-use items or those with charges) can be intelligent. (This means that potions, scrolls, and wands, among other items, are never intelligent.) In general, less than 1% of magic items have intelligence.

Intelligent items can actually be considered creatures because they have Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores and should be treated as constructs. They often have the ability to illuminate their surroundings at will (as magic weapons do), and many cannot see otherwise.

Unlike most magic items, intelligent items can activate their own powers without waiting for a command word from their owner. Intelligent items act during their owner's turn in the initiative order.

## Designing an Intelligent Item

All intelligent magic items possess similar properties. All must have an alignment, mental ability scores, languages, senses, and at least one other special ability. These statistics and abilities can be improved during creation, increasing the item's overall cost. Many of these abilities add to an item's Ego score. Intelligent items with high Ego scores are difficult to control and can sometimes take control of their owners, making them dangerous to possess.

An intelligent magic item has a base price increase of 500 gp. When determining the total value of an intelligent item, add this value to the sum of all its additional abilities's prices before adding them to the magic item's base price.

## Intelligent Item Alignment

Any item with intelligence has an alignment. Note that intelligent weapons already have alignments, either stated or by implication. If you're generating a random intelligent weapon, that weapon's alignment must fit with any alignment-oriented special abilities it has.

Any character whose alignment does not correspond to that of the item (except as noted by the asterisks on the table below) gains one negative level if he so much as picks up the item. Although this negative level never results in actual level loss, it remains as long as the item is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including by restoration spells). this negative level is cumulative with any other penalties the item might place on inappropriate wielders. items with ego scores of 20 to 29 bestow two negative levels. items with ego scores of 30 or higher bestow three negative levels.

[Intelligent Item Alignment]
| d% | Alignment of Item |
| --- | --- |
| 01–10 | Chaotic good |
| 11–20 | Chaotic neutral\* |
| 21–35 | Chaotic evil |
| 36–45 | Neutral evil\* |
| 46–55 | Lawful evil |
| 56–70 | Lawful good |
| 71–80 | Lawful neutral\* |
| 81–90 | Neutral good\* |
| 91–100 | Neutral |

## Intelligent Item Ability Scores

Intelligent magic items possess all three mental ability scores: Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. Each one of these ability scores begins at a value of 10, but can be increased to as high as 20. The table below shows the cost to increase one of the item's ability scores. This cost must be paid for each ability score raised above 10. For example, an intelligent magic item with a Intelligence 15, Wisdom 12, and Charisma 10 would cost at least 2,400 gp more than the base item (including the 500 gp for being an intelligent item).

[Intelligent Item Ability Scores]
| Score | Base Price Modifier | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 10 | — | — |
| 11 | +200 gp | — |
| 12 | +500 gp | +1 |
| 13 | +700 gp | +1 |
| 14 | +1,000 gp | +2 |
| 15 | +1,400 gp | +2 |
| 16 | +2,000 gp | +3 |
| 17 | +2,800 gp | +3 |
| 18 | +4,000 gp | +4 |
| 19 | +5,200 gp | +4 |
| 20 | +8,000 gp | +5 |

## Languages Spoken by Item

Like a character, an intelligent item understands Common plus one additional language per point of Intelligence bonus. Choose appropriate languages, taking into account the item's origin and purposes. If the item does not possess speech, it can still read and understand the languages it knows.

## Senses and Communication

Every intelligent magic item begins with the ability to see and hear within 30 feet, as well as the ability to communicate emphatically with its owner. Empathy only allows the item to encourage or discourage certain actions through urges and emotions. Additional forms of communication and better senses increase the item's cost and Ego score.

**Empathy (Su)** : Empathy allows the item to encourage or discourage certain actions by communicating emotions and urges. It does not allow for verbal communication.

**Speech (Su)** : An intelligent item with this ability can speak out loud using any of the languages it knows.

**Telepathy (Su)** : Telepathy allows an intelligent item to hold private mental conversations with its wielder, regardless of their known languages. The wielder must be touching the item to communicate in this way.

**Senses** : Senses allow an intelligent magic item to see and hear out to the listed distance. Adding darkvision or blindsense grants the use of those senses at the same range.

**Read Languages (Ex)** : The item can read script in any language, regardless of its known languages.

**Read Magic (Sp)** : An intelligent magic item with this ability can read magical writings and scrolls as if through _ [read magic](spells/readMagic.md#_read-magic). _This ability does not allow the magic item to activate scrolls or other items. An intelligent magic item can suppress and resume this ability as a free action.

[Intelligent Item Senses and Communication]
| Ability | Base Price Modifier | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Empathy | — | — |
| Speech | +500 gp | — |
| Telepathy | +1,000 gp | +1 |
| Senses (30 ft.) | — | — |

| Read languages | +1,000 gp | +1 |
| _ [Read magic](spells/readMagic.md#_read-magic)_ | +2,000 gp | +1 |

## Intelligent Item Powers

Each intelligent item should possess at least one power, although some might possess a host of powers. To find the item's specific powers, roll on or choose from the table below. All powers function at the direction of the item, though intelligent items generally follow the wishes of their owner. Activating a power or concentrating on an active one is a standard action for the item. The caster level for these effects is equal to the item's caster level. Save DCs are based on the item's highest mental ability score.

[Intelligent Item Powers]
| d% | Item Power | Base Price Modifer | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01–10 | Item can cast a 0-level spell at will | +1,000 gp | +1 |
| 11–20 | Item can cast a 1st-level spell 3/day | +1,200 gp | +1 |
| 21–25 | Item can use _ [magic aura](spells/magicAura.md#_magic-aura) _on itself at will | +2,000 gp | +1 |
| 26–35 | Item can cast a 2nd-level spell 1/day | +2,400 gp | +1 |
| 36–45 | Item has 5 ranks in one skill\* | +2,500 gp | +1 |
| 46–50 | Item can sprout limbs and move with a speed of 10 feet | +5,000 gp | +1 |
| 51–55 | Item can cast a 3rd-level spell 1/day | +6,000 gp | +1 |
| 56–60 | Item can cast a 2nd-level spell 3/day | +7,200 gp | +1 |
| 61–70 | Item has 10 ranks in one skill\* | +10,000 gp | +2 |

| 91–95 | Item can cast a 3rd-level spell 3/day | +18,000 gp | +2 |
| 96–100 | Item can cast a 4th-level spell 3/day | +33,600 gp | +2 |

## Special Purpose Items

Some intelligent items have special purposes that guide their actions. Intelligent magic items with a special purpose gain a +2 Ego bonus. An item's purpose must suit the type and alignment of the item. A magic item with a purpose should be treated as an individual with a goal, not a fanatical parody. For example, a purpose of "defeat/slay arcane spellcasters" doesn't mean that an intelligent sword forces the wielder to kill every wizard she sees. Nor does it mean that the sword believes it is possible to kill every wizard, sorcerer, and bard in the world. It does mean that the item hates arcane spellcasters and wants to bring an end to the rule of a sorcerer-queen in a nearby land. Likewise, a purpose of "defend elves" doesn't mean that if the wielder is an elf, he only wants to help the wielder. It means that the item wants to be used in furthering the cause of elves, stamping out their enemies and aiding their leaders. A purpose of "defeat/slay all" isn't just a matter of self-preservation. It means that the item won't rest (or let its wielder rest) until it places itself above all others.

The table below has a number of sample purposes that a magic item might possess. If the wielder specifically ignores or goes against an intelligent item's special purpose, the item gains a +4 bonus to its Ego until the wielder cooperates. This is in addition to the +2 Ego bonus gained by items with a special purpose.

[Intelligent Item Purpose]
| d% | Purpose | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 01–20 | Defeat/slay diametrically opposed alignment\* | +2 |
| 21–30 | Defeat/slay arcane spellcasters (including spellcasting monsters and those that use spell-like abilities) | +2 |
| 31–40 | Defeat/slay divine spellcasters (including divine entities and servitors) | +2 |
| 41–50 | Defeat/slay nonspellcasters | +2 |
| 51–55 | Defeat/slay a particular creature type (see the _ [bane](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-bane)_ special ability for choices) | +2 |
| 56–60 | Defeat/slay a particular race or kind of creature | +2 |
| 61–70 | Defend a particular race or kind of creature | +2 |
| 71–80 | Defeat/slay the servants of a specific deity | +2 |
| 81–90 | Defend the servants and interests of a specific deity | +2 |
| 91–95 | Defeat/slay all (other than the item and the wielder) | +2 |
| 96–100 | Choose one | +2 |

## Dedicated Powers

A dedicated power operates only when an intelligent item is in pursuit of its special purpose. This determination is always made by the item. Unlike its other powers, an intelligent item can refuse to use its dedicated powers even if the owner is dominant (see Items Against Characters). The caster level for these effects is equal to the item's caster level. Save DCs are based on the item's highest mental ability score.

[Special Purpose Item Dedicated Powers]
| d% | Dedicated Power | Base Price Modifier | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 01–20 | Item can detect any special purpose foes within 60 feet | +10,000 gp | +1 |
| 21–35 | Item can use a 4th-level spell at will | +56,000 gp | +2 |
| 36–50 | Wielder gets +2 luck bonus on attacks, saves, and checks | +80,000 gp | +2 |
| 51–65 | Item can use a 5th-level spell at will | +90,000 gp | +2 |
| 66–80 | Item can use a 6th-level spell at will | +132,000 gp | +2 |
| 81–95 | Item can use a 7th-level spell at will | +182,000 gp | +2 |
| 96–100 | Item can use _ [true resurrection](spells/trueResurrection.md#_true-resurrection)_ on wielder, once per month | +200,000 gp | +2 |

## Item Ego

Ego is a measure of the total power and force of personality that an item possesses. An item's Ego score is the sum of all of its Ego modifiers plus an additional bonus for the cost of the base magic item (excluding the cost of all of the intelligent item enhancements). An item's Ego score helps determine whether the item or the character is dominant in their relationship, as detailed below.

[Ego Modifier by Base Value]
| Base Magic Item Value | Ego Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| Up to 1,000 gp | — |
| 1,001 gp to 5,000 gp | +1 |
| 5,001 gp to 10,000 gp | +2 |
| 10,001 gp to 20,000 gp | +3 |
| 20,001 gp to 50,000 gp | +4 |
| 50,001 gp to 100,000 gp | +6 |
| 100,001 gp to 200,000 gp | +8 |
| 200,001 gp and higher | +12 |

## Items against Characters

When an item has an Ego of its own, it has a will of its own. The item is absolutely true to its alignment. If the character who possesses the item is not true to that alignment's goals or the item's special purpose, a personality conflict results—item against character. Similarly, any item with an Ego score of 20 or higher always considers itself superior to any character, and a personality conflict results if the possessor does not always agree with the item.

When a personality conflict occurs, the possessor must make a Will saving throw (DC = the item's Ego). If the possessor succeeds, she is dominant. If she fails, the item is dominant. Dominance lasts for 1 day or until a critical situation occurs (such as a major battle, a serious threat to either the item or the character, and so on, as determined by the GM). Should an item gain dominance, it resists the character's desires and demands concessions such as any of the following:

- Removal of associates or items whose alignment or personality is distasteful to the item.
- The character divesting herself of all other magic items or items of a certain type.
- Obedience from the character so the item can direct where they go for its own purposes.
- Immediate seeking out and slaying of creatures hateful to the item.
- Magical protections and devices to safeguard the item from molestation when it is not in use.
- That the character carry the item with her on all occasions.
- That the character relinquish the item to a more suitable possessor due to alignment differences or conduct.

In extreme circumstances, the item can resort to even harsher measures, such as the following:

- Force its possessor into combat.
- Refuse to strike opponents.
- Strike at its wielder or her associates.
- Force its possessor to surrender to an opponent.
- Cause itself to drop from the character's grasp.

Naturally, such actions are unlikely when harmony reigns between the character's and item's alignments or when their purposes and personalities are well matched. Even so, an item might wish to have a lesser character possess it in order to easily establish and maintain dominance over him, or a higher-level possessor so as to better accomplish its goals.

All magic items with personalities desire to play an important role in whatever activity is under way, particularly combat. Such items are natural rivals, even with others of the same alignment. No intelligent item wants to share its wielder with other intelligent magic items. An intelligent item is aware of the presence of any other intelligent item within 60 feet, and such an intelligent item usually tries its best to mislead or distract its host so that she ignores or destroys the rival. Of course, alignment might change this sort of behavior.

Items with personalities are never totally controlled or silenced by the characters that possess them, even though they might never successfully control their possessors. They might be powerless to force their demands, but most remain undaunted and continue to air their wishes and preferences.

## Specific Intelligent Items

The following are examples of specific intelligent items that can be crafted or found in treasure hoards.

Armor of the Shadow Lord

**Price** 117,160 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 8th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Alignment** neutral; **Senses** 120 ft., darkvision

**Intelligence** 14; **Wisdom** 16; **Charisma** 14; **Ego** 14

**Language** telepathy (Aklo, Common, and Elven)

This suit of _+4 greater [shadow](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-shadow) greater [slick](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-slick) leather armor _fits as snugly as a tight suit of silk against its wearer's skin and harbors an amoral and bloodthirsty intelligence. Via the telepathy it shares with its wielder, the armor gives constant advice on how to be stealthy, reach out of the way spots, and get the drop on foes. It also grants an extra +1d6 points of sneak attack damage, but the wearer must already have the sneak attack class feature to gain this bonus. Furthermore the armor has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +10 and no arcane spell failure.

**Construction Requirements**

**Cost** 58,660 GP

[Craft Magic Arms and Armor](feats.md#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [grease](spells/grease.md#_grease)_, _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_, _ [silence](spells/silence.md#_silence)_, creator must have the sneak attack class feature

Chomper

**Price** None; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

**Alignment** chaotic evil; **Senses** 30 ft., [blindsense](bestiary3/universalMonsterRules.md#_blindsense)

**Intelligence** 10; **Wisdom** 14; **Charisma** 13; **Ego** 17

**Language** speech (Abyssal)

Most _bags of devouring_ appear to be normal sacks, but _Chomper_ is unlike most _bags of devouring_. Sporting rows of vicious teeth, a bad attitude, and a thirst to devour all things, this intelligent cursed item believes that it is the favored maw and most important appendage of a creature it mysteriously refers to as the Eater of All. _Chomper_ hates all creatures except for demons, whom it considers kindred spirits of destruction.

_Chomper_ has all of the magical abilities of a regular _bag of devouring_, along with the following additional powers.

- As a standard action, _Chomper's_ possessor can swing the bag by its straps in an attempt to strike any single creature or unattended item within a 5-foot radius. _Chomper_ (not the wielder) can then make a single bite attack against the target. This bite has a +14 attack bonus and deals 1d10+5 points of damage plus 2 points of bleed damage. This action does not provoke attacks of opportunity. Attacks made in this way are never modified by the wielder's abilities.
- When a non-demon is in possession of _Chomper_, the bag's cursed aura imparts a –1 penalty on all of its wielder's attack rolls, saving throws, skill checks, and ability checks. If _Chomper_ manages to gain dominance over a non-demon wielder through a personality conflict, it directs its bearer to seek out victims to feed to it.

**Intended Magic Item**

_ [bag of holding](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_bag-of-holding) type III_

Hammer of Enemies

**Price** 54,212 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Alignment** chaotic neutral; **Senses** 30 ft., darkvision

**Intelligence** 10; **Wisdom** 16; **Charisma** 14; **Ego** 14

**Language** speech (Common)

This special _+3 [bane](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-bane) warhammer_ seeks only to crush the enemy of its wielder in battle. The hammer can speak Common, constantly mutters, curses when it is not engaged in battle, and sings deeply of its love of carnage when it is being used in a fight. The _hammer of enemies_ is always eager to point out potential enemies within its vision. Because of its bloodlust it does not bestow negative levels on creatures that do not share its alignment—it is willing to fight for anyone. Additionally, three times per day, the _hammer of enemies _can change the creature type of its bane ability. A creature type remains until a new one is chosen.

**Construction Requirements**

**Cost** 27,262 GP

Craft Magic Arms and Armor; _monster summoning IV_

harbinger rod

**Price** 44,200 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Alignment** lawful [good](bestiary3/creatureTypes.md#_good-subtype); **Senses** 30 ft.

**Intelligence** 10; **Wisdom** 13; **Charisma** 12; **Ego** 10

**Language** telepathy (Celestial;_ truespeech_)

This copper rod is made up of constantly grinding gearlike parts. It is believed that these rods may be some alternate or lesser form of harbinger archons. The rod can take may useful forms, and after 24 hours in the possession of a lawful good creature, the wielder can command it to take the form of any tool, including a _ [chime of opening](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_chime-of-opening)_. Very intelligent and witty, these rods communicate with their wielders in truespeech or Celestial. Furthermore, the rod has the following powers.

- Three times per day, on command, the rod's wielder can use _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor.md#_dimension-door)_, as the spell.
- Once per day, on command, the rod can emit a blast of energy that deals 2d6 points of force damage to creatures adjacent to the wielder. A successful DC 12 Reflex save halves the damage. The wielder can choose to omit any target from this blast that it desires, damaging only the foes it chooses.

The rod's purpose is to destroy or foil the plans of chaotic evil creatures.

**Construction Requirements**

**Cost** 22,100 GP

Craft Rod, _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor.md#_dimension-door), [knock](spells/knock.md#_knock), [explosive runes](spells/explosiveRunes.md#_explosive-runes), _creator must be lawful good

Headband of the sage

**Price** 71,300 gp; **Aura** moderate divination; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

**Alignment** varies; **Senses** 30 ft.

**Intelligence** 20; **Wisdom** 16; **Charisma** 12; **Ego** 20

**Language** telepathy (Common and 10 other languages)

A _headband of vast intellect +6_ also holds a consciousness that shares its knowledge and education with a suitable wearer. This intellect can be of any alignment and its only purpose is to share its vast knowledge with its wearer.

**Language** speech (Auran)

This intelligent item is called a _lightning bow_ by mortals, a name is seen as a slight to the lightning elemental trapped within it—a creature honor-bound to serve in the bow for no less than 100 years. Each of these _+3 adaptive composite longbows_ is a haughty and often highly intelligent member of its race, who chides those who don't know its true name—which is often a complicated series of high pitched squeaks, like live wood burning on a pyre. The elemental in a _lightning bow _only speaks Auran. _Lightning bows_ will not fire on other outsiders with the elemental subtype. Some are also bound not to attack other individuals, based on their history. For instance, one of these bows might be foresworn not to attack the Sultan of Fire, fire giants, or red dragons. Additionally, _lightning bows_ have the following powers.

- A _lightning bow_ needs no ammunition. With the pull of a string, it creates a _+3 [shock](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-shock) arrow_ or a _+3 [brilliant energy](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-brilliant-energy) arrow (_the wielder's choice with each shot).
- Three times per day, the wielder can cast _ [true strike](spells/trueStrike.md#_true-strike)_ as a swift action. The _ [true strike](spells/trueStrike.md#_true-strike)_ can only be used with attacks made with the _lightning bow_.
- Three times per day, the wielder can use _ [lightning bolt](spells/lightningBolt.md#_lightning-bolt)_ as a spell-like ability.

metamagician's apprentice

**Price** 93,605 gp; **Aura** strong divination; **CL** 18th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

**Alignment** lawful neutral; **Senses** 120 ft.

**Intelligence** 18; **Wisdom** 14; **Charisma** 10; **Ego** 20

**Language** telepathy (Common and eight other languages)

This slender rod is usually capped with a metal knob resembling the face of a young male or female mage. The first rod of this type was created by a ruthless cabal of wizards and sorcerers who transferred the minds of their most promising apprentices into a set of rods for the sake of greater power.

The bound apprentices' intellects have no free will but retain their rebellious imaginations. Under normal circumstances, the rod must do what its wielder commands, but it can make telepathic, respectful complaints about how unhappy it is to be a group of living minds imprisoned in an inanimate object—though few wielders care. While no good creature would create a _metamagician's apprentice_, he or she can still wield one.

The rod can be used as a _+1 [light](spells/light.md#_light) mace_. On command, it transforms into a _+1/+1 quarterstaff_ or back to its rod form.

A _metamagician's apprentice_ knows four metamagic feats (limited to feats that use a spell slot one or two levels higher than the spell's actual level, such as [Silent Spell](feats.md#_silent-spell) and [Empower Spell](feats.md#_empower-spell)) and acts as a _greater metamagic rod_ for those feats. The rod can only apply one metamagic feat to a spell at a time, though (like a _metamagic rod_) the wielder can use his own feats and the rod's on the same spell.

The rod can use _ [read magic](spells/readMagic.md#_read-magic)_ and _ [detect magic](spells/detectMagic.md#_detect-magic)_ at will. The _metamagician's apprentice_ is never overwhelmed by powerful magic auras. These abilities do not trigger effects that require reading to activate (such as the _ [explosive runes](spells/explosiveRunes.md#_explosive-runes)_ spell). The rod grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on three [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) skills; these skills are determined when the rod is created (and require the apprentice to have ranks in that skill) and can never be changed. [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (arcana) is almost always one of these three skills.

A typical rod of this type is lawful neutral, though rods with other alignments exist.

If a _metamagician's apprentice_ becomes dominant after a personality conflict, it insists the wearer find a way to free its mind from the object or destroy the item so its mind can be at peace.

**Language** telepathy (Common and seven other languages)

These _rings of protection +3_ are extremely varied in form. They can be of any alignment and each has its own unique personality and proclivities. Each ring has a specific obsession. To determine a particular _obsession ring_'s obsession, roll on Table 6–10: Intelligent Item Purpose. When the ring is in pursuit of its purpose, its Ego is 10 points higher than normal.

Gnomes with the obsession racial trait have a unique understanding of the ring's mentality and gain a +5 bonus on Will saving throws to resist the _obsession ring_'s attempts to dominate the wearer.

When an _obsession ring_ is engaged in action directly related to its obsession, it grants its wearer the following powers, but can choose to withhold such powers if it does not believe their uses would further its obsession.

- The ring functions as a _ [ring of protection](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-protection) +5_.
- The ring grants its wearer a +2 luck bonus on attack rolls against creatures its obsession is sworn to defeat.
- Three times per day, the ring can allow its wearer to reroll any saving throw. The wearer gains a +4 luck bonus on the saving throw reroll.

These rings are typically quite emphatic on their desire to fulfill their obsessions, and frequently communicate with their wielder to encourage pursuit of this goal.

This rod is a fusion of magic and the limb of a dangerous, nearly mindless aberration. This rod features a single writhing tentacle at one end. The rod contains the mind of a living creature, but it does not have the ability to communicate via speech, empathy, or telepathy. If allowed, the rod attempts to attack creatures within reach, and must be stowed in a bag or backpack when the wielder is sleeping to keep it from grasping at the wielder or other creatures.

On command, the tentacle attacks an adjacent creature as a melee touch attack (attack bonus +8). On a successful hit, the tentacle deals 2d8 points of acid damage and the target must succeed at a DC 14 Will saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 round. This paralysis is a mind-affecting fear effect.

The greater version of this rod has four tentacles, which attack the same target simultaneously on command (attack bonus +12). The tentacles collectively deal 4d8 points of acid damage and the target must succeed at a DC 18 Will saving throw or be paralyzed for 1 round. This paralysis is a mind-affecting fear effect. The greater rods have a dedicated purpose: serve a bloodthirsty master.

This _ [caster's shield](magicItems/armor.md#_caster-s-shield) _always has one arcane scroll and knows the same arcane spells as the wielder.

This _+2 [keen](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-keen) [dancing](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-dancing) longsword_ is infused with the soul of a bard who chose to instill his consciousness into a weapon rather than to see his voice die. The sword constantly sings. The only way to silence it to a whisper is with a DC 15 [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) or [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) check, and even this only quiets the sword for 10 minutes plus another 10 minutes for every 5 points by which the DC is exceeded. The sword speaks, though it typically communicates through song. A _singing sword_ has the following powers.

- Eight times per day, a _singing sword_ can use bardic performance, but can only use the countersong, distraction, fascinate, inspire courage, or inspire competence abilities. The sword is treated as an 8th-level bard for the purposes of these abilities.
