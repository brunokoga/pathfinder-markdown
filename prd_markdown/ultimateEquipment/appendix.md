# Treasure Generator

The following system gives GMs a way to generate random treasure to reward players after completing an encounter or otherwise recovering valuables. The following system gives guidance to the gm to determine the type of treasure given based on the nature of the monsters or encounter.

Some rolls might generate treasure worth more than the expected average, others will likely generate less. The GM should decide whether or not to allow such variance, and adjust his rolls accordingly if he desires more even treasure distribution (rerolling as necessary to get closer to the expected value).

When using these rules to generate random treasure, you need to know the general type of encounter and level of treasure to be assigned (usually related to the total challenge faced). The Challenge Rating of the encounter determines the overall approximate value of the treasure to be gained. The makeup of adversaries in the encounter generally dictates the types of treasure that can be gained by overcoming its challenges.

Use the two following steps to figure out how much treasure to award characters and determine which treasure types are used in generating the specific items to appear in that treasure.

## Step 1: Determine Treasure Budget

The first step is to determine the amount of treasure you can budget for an encounter. Start by determining the overall Challenge Rating of the encounter and the advancement rate of the group. Refer to the Treasure Values per Encounter table to determine the base value of the treasure for an encounter in terms of gold pieces. You might wish to award greater treasures than what the value indicates. In such a case, hold back on awarding treasure for a number of encounters, in effect "banking" the value for one larger reward. Alternatively, you might decide to simply have a game with a higher amount of treasure in general, increasing all the base values by 50% or more.

After determining the base value of an encounter depending on its CR, next check the treasure line in the individual stat blocks for all creatures involved. In the case of mixed groups of enemies, use the most generous treasure entry. The treasure entry for the creatures involved affects the overall reward of the encounter as follows.

**None** : The creature does not typically possess treasure and an encounter solely against creatures with this treasure type should not award any treasure. You can still award treasure for this encounter if uncommon circumstances warrant it. The value that would have been awarded for this encounter can be saved to increase the value of a treasure from a later encounter.

**Incidental** : Creatures with this treasure type have little if any treasure. Reduce the base treasure value by half (50%).

**Standard** : The creature has the normal amount of treasure. Do not adjust the base treasure value.

**Double** : The creature has more than average treasure. Double the base treasure value.

**Triple** : The creature has a large amount of treasure. Triple the base treasure value.

**NPC Gear** : Creatures with this treasure type have a different treasure value. Discard the base treasure value and look up the value for each individual creature on the NPC Gear table. Each creature's treasure should be determined individually. If a creature with this treasure type is part of a mixed group, deduct this value from the base treasure value for the rest of the creatures in the group.

This value is treated like a budget, to be spent on the relevant treasure tables (as determined in Step 2), purchasing groupings that establish a number of rolls you must make to determine the exact treasure gained.

## Step 2: Determine Treasure Type

To determine the type of treasures gained from an encounter, examine the types of creatures in the encounter and the general setting of the encounter. The types of treasure garnered from encounters can vary wildly depending on the types of creatures encountered. For example, the treasure found in the lair of a troll (remnants of its previous meals, no doubt) is sure to be different than the treasure found in the burial crypt of an ancient mummy. While the troll's treasure might contain coins and small objects such as potions or rings, the mummy's crypt might hold gems, art objects, and ancient magic items. Even if these types of treasures are worth approximately the same value, their exact composition is different.

The following section looks at each creature type individually and describes what treasures a particular type usually has. Each creature type lists a number of different treasure types, denoted by letters, which are described in detail in Step 3. Not every creature of each type will follow these guidelines, so weigh each carefully before deciding what treasure type best fits the creature. Note that a creature typically has treasure of only one type, but in some circumstances it might fit the encounter to have treasures of multiple different types as part of the reward.

**Aberration** : Many aberrations have little use for treasure, possessing only what hangs from the remains of their previous victims. Others are cunning adversaries that use various magic items and treasure to enhance their abilities.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E (add F, G, H if the creature is cunning).

**Animal** : Animals place little to no value on treasure, instead leaving such coins and objects with the remains of their meals. For those with treasure, it is typically found in their lairs, scattered amid bones and other refuse.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E.

**Construct** : The only treasure carried by constructs is usually part of their construction, such as a weapon or magic item. Constructs are, however, typically used to guard more valuable treasures or magic items.

_Treasure Types_: E, F (add B, C, H if the creature is guarding a treasure).

**Dragon** : Known for their valuable treasures, dragons often brood over vast piles of coins, gems, magic items, and other expensive objects.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, C, H, I.

**Fey** : Above all other things, fey value items of magic and beauty. They have little use for tools of trade and commerce used by the more civilized races, such as coins and valuables.

_Treasure Types_: B, C, D, G.

**Humanoid** : Creatures of this type are quite varied, but even the most primitive humanoids use gear and magic items to some extent. In bigger groups such as communities, humanoids often posses larger amounts of treasure that they collectively guard.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E, F, G (add H for an entire community).

**Magical Beast** : Caring little for valuables, most magical beasts are only in search of their next meal. The lairs of these creatures are often strewn with a few valuable trinkets and magic items.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E.

**Monstrous Humanoid** : Most monstrous humanoids care only about treasures that they can use, although some have been known to hoard valuables in their lairs.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, c, D, E, H.

**Ooze** : Oozes have no concept of treasure and leave any they find behind as they search for their next meal. Any treasure they might carry is entirely accidental.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D.

**Outsider** : Outsiders are one of the most varied creature types and as a result might truly have any type of treasure on them or hidden in their lair. The GM should consider the creature individually to determine the treasure type that best fits the outsider.

_Treasure Types_: any.

**Plant** : Like animals, plant creatures do not care for treasure, and any that might be found where they grow is simply the indigestible remnants of a previous victim.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E.

**Undead** : The treasure carried by undead varies depending on whether or not the creature is intelligent. Unintelligent undead typically only possess meager valuables carried on themselves in life, rarely actually using such treasures, while intelligent undead take advantage of a wide variety of magic items in order to destroy the living.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D, E (add F, G for intelligent undead).

**Vermin** : Like other mindless creatures, vermin do not covet treasure, although such creatures are sometimes found infesting areas where valuables are kept.

_Treasure Types_: A, B, D.

## Step 3: Generate Treasure

Once the total approximate value has been determined and the treasure types selected, all that remains is to select the actual treasures. Each treasure type has a wide variety of rewards, each with its own approximate gold piece value. Select a number of rewards whose total gold piece value is equal to the total value of the treasure to be awarded for defeating the encounter. For example, in an encounter against a group of trolls, the GM determines that he wants to give out items from treasure types B and E with a total value of 5,000 gp. He selects two rewards from those presented in type B with a value of 1,000 gp each and one from type E with a value of 3,000 gp. Alternatively, he could have selected one reward from type E worth 5,000 gp, or five rewards from type B worth 1,000 gp each, or any other combination that adds up to a total of 5,000 gp.

Each reward lists one or more random rolls you need to make to determine the actual treasure. For example, an entry might specify that the reward contains 5d10 × 10 gold pieces, 2 random potions from the minor potion table, and 1 item from the minor wondrous item table. The actual, final value might vary from the amount listed for the reward, but over time these random rolls should average out, giving the PCs the right amount of treasure needed to face challenges of their level.

Many of the rewards require you to generate a random magic item from one of the other tables located throughout this book. In most cases, the reward specifies which table you should roll on and where that table can be found.

### Selecting Rewards

The GM should take care in deciding what rewards to give the PCs. In most cases, the GM should settle for the largest reward her budget allows, filling any excess budget with lesser rewards and coins (usually type A treasure). This gives the PCs a chance to get some of the more powerful magic items that are appropriate for their level. Selecting a larger number of smaller rewards grants a larger number of items, but they will be of comparatively lesser value in terms of usefulness.

### Treasure Types

Treasure comes in many shapes and forms, from simple coins and lustrous gems to magic swords and powerful staves. Due the numerous different kinds of treasure, this system organizes them into types to make it easy to assign them to an encounter. The types share some of the various kinds of treasures (such as coins and potions), but each is aimed at a specific sort of encounter, as noted below in their descriptions.

**Type A, Coins Coins table** : Treasure of this type consists entirely of coins. Coins can be found in nearly any encounter.

**Type B, Coins and Gems (Coins and Gems table)** : Similar to Type A treasure, this type also includes gemstones, some of which can be quite valuable. It is typically found in a small cache or as part of a larger treasure roll.

**Type C, Art Objects (Art Objects table)** : Often overlooked, these items are valuable for their beauty and craftsmanship and are made with precious metals, gems, and other fine materials. Art objects are typically displayed in residences or placed in small vaults for safekeeping.

**Type D, Coins and Small Objects (Coins and Small Objects table)** : This category consists of coins and small magic items, such as potions, rings, scrolls, and wands. Such treasure is typically found in the lairs of beasts or as a small hoard in a monster den.

**Type E, Armor and Weapons (Armor and Weapons table)** : Consisting solely of weapons and armor, treasure of this type can be found in armories, stored in a den, or even in use by a monster.

**Type F, Combatant Gear (Combatant Gear table)** : This treasure type is made up of items that would typically be carried by a monster that relies on melee or ranged combat. It includes armor, coins, potions, weapons, and wondrous items.

**Type G, Spellcaster Gear (Spellcaster Gear table)** : This treasure type is carried by creatures with spellcasting abilities, and includes coins, potions, scrolls, staves, wands, and wondrous items.

**Type H, Lair Treasure (Lair Treasure table)** : This treasure type can contain items of nearly any variety, but it focuses primarily on treasure of lesser individual value. It frequently includes a large number of magic items, coins, and other valuables.

**Type I, Treasure Hoard (Treasure Hoard table)** : Truly the greatest of the treasure types, this can contain virtually any type of item. It usually serves as the reward for many challenging encounters, saved up and placed in one location.

# Gems and Jewelry

Principally used to make trinkets and adorn objects, gems may also serve as a compact form of currency, and jewelry can be an efficient way to store treasure. Gems can be found uncut or not set within jewelry. They are often used to adorn walls and statues, and can be plucked from their settings.

There are two main categories of gemstones: semi-precious and precious gems. Most types of gems are semi-precious. Only a select number of gems are considered precious and fetch incredible prices. Some gems, such as those found in mines or quarries, are found in their unworked state. In general, an unworked gemstone is worth half as much as a worked gemstone of the same type.

Gems and jewelry can be bought or sold at their total value, and are sometimes used as currency. For simplicity's sake, assume that 50 gems weigh 1 pound.

## Generating Gems

When randomly determining gems, roll on the appropriate grade chart. To determine the gemstone's total value, roll the added value and add it to the base value. If you would prefer the average value instead, simply double the base value.

In addition, if the roll to determine the type of gem is an odd roll, the gem is unworked, which means its value is equal to half the total value of a normal gem of that type, but it can made into a worked gem with a successful [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (jewelry) check of the appropriate DC based on the gem's grade (the gem counts as the raw material cost, so the crafter need not pay that amount). On an even roll, the gem is worked, can't be improved upon, and is worth the listed cost.

## Semi-Precious Stones

Semi-precious stones can be very valuable, but tend to be more muddled or less brilliant than precious stones. They also come in more varieties. Semi-precious stones can be made into jewelry such as rings and amulets, used to decorate items like beads and buttons, or crafted into cameos and small gem figurines.

**Agate** : These banded stones are a variety of quartz, and take on a variety of shapes and patterns.

**Alabaster** : This white- to cream-colored stone is thinly cut to create decorative surfaces or shaped into small objects.

**Amber** : Derived from golden-yellow to golden-orange fossilized tree resin, pieces of amber sometimes contain insects, pine needles, and even more exotic flora and fauna.

**Amethyst** : This rare purple or mauve quartz is thought by some to ward off drunkenness, and is thus held in particularly high esteem by lushes and winos.

**Aquamarine** : These blue or sea green crystals are often faceted to show off their luster and reflective qualities.

**Azurite** : This blue copper mineral is produced after copper deposits are exposed to the elements for a long time, and is used to make blue dyes as well as jewelry.

**Bloodstone** : This variety of chalcedony is green and dotted with blood red jasper, and is also called heliotrope.

**Carnelian** : This translucent red or orange mineral is most often polished to create beads, decorative pieces, and cameos.

**Chrysoberyl** : These hard gemstones can be green, greenish yellow, or yellow brown. They are brilliant when cut, but often lack the fire of more precious stones.

**Chrysoprase** : This apple-green decorative stone is sometimes confused with jade, and is used both decoratively and in the creation of cameos.

**Citrine** : This pale yellow to golden yellow stone is a type of quartz and is used to create faceted gemstones and decorative objects.

**Coral** : Borne from the sea, coral is not a true mineral, but is the red, blue, or black skeletal remains of minute marine animals called coral polyps.

**Garnet** : These gems come in a variety of colors, from red and orange to yellow and green. They are commonly faceted to set into jewelry.

**Hematite** : These stones have a dark and metallic luster, and are the chief source of mined iron.

**Ivory** : Ivory comes from the teeth or tusks of elephants, hippopotamuses, boars, and some whales, and is carved to create both decorative and functional items.

**Jade** : This bright to dull green stone is carved and polished to create decorative pieces, small carved statues or objects, and various ornaments.

**Jasper** : This stone comes in shades of brown, red, yellow, green, and rarely blue. Sometimes it is striped. It is often carved and polished to make decorative pieces such as vases and amulets.

**Jet** : This fossil stone is dark gray to black, and is formed from decaying wood that has been under great pressure for millions of years.

**Lapis Lazuli** : This spotted blue stone is a composed of several different minerals, primarily lazurite.

**Malachite** : This opaque green stone is often banded with paler hues. It is made up of crystals that are too small to be faceted, but can be polished into striking decorative items.

**Moonstone** : This clear stone's namesake comes from its blue-white sheen, though some cultures believe the gem comes from the moon itself.

**Obsidian** : This natural volcanic glass is often black, but blue, brown, green, red, and gray obsidian also exist. It is carved and polished into decorative items, and holds a sharp edge that makes it suitable for primitive blades.

**Onyx** : This stone features curved bands of black, white, and brown minerals. It is used to make decorative objects.

**Opal** : Found in white, black, and orange colors, the orange variety is often called a fire opal. Sometimes opals feature iridescent flashes of other colors. They can be both faceted and used to create decorative items and cameos.

**Pearl** : Formed by various types of shellfish, pearls are created when grit gets stuck inside a creature's shell for an extended amount of time. Freshwater pearls tend to be irregular in shape, while saltwater pearls are typically a lustrous white and more evenly shaped. Black pearls are the rarest of pearls.

**Peridot** : These olive green gems have an oily or greasy luster to them.

**Quartz** : This common gem comes in a variety of forms. The nearly clear form of quartz is also known as rock crystal, and is the most common kind of quartz. Rose quartz has a pinkish hue, while smoky quartz is of a hazy brown color and is sometimes called brown quartz. As its name implies, milky quartz a milky white color. Quartz is very versatile, and can be carved, faceted, and crafted into decorative items.

**Rhodochrosite** : These pink- and white-banded stones can be shaped into decorative items and cameos.

**Sard** : This brownish red stone is often translucent and features patchy coloring.

**Sardonyx** : This banded mix of sard and onyx is used to make decorative pieces and cameos.

**Shell** : Shells come in many forms, and can be fashioned into decorative items or cameos. Sometimes a shell is beautiful enough to be considered worked even in its natural form.

**Spinel** : Found in pink, blue, red, and star stone varieties, the most popular form of spinel is red, which is sometimes confused with a ruby.

**Tigereye** : This golden and brown striped stone, when polished, looks like a cat's eye.

**Topaz** : These transparent gems range wildly in color. They can be golden yellow, pink, gray, blue, or green, and are almost always faceted for fitting into jewelry.

**Tourmaline** : These transparent stones can be crimson, blue, brown, or clear. They are almost always faceted for jewelry, especially rings and necklaces.

**Turquoise** : This common gem is typically brilliant blue but is sometimes greenish blue. It is used to create decorative items, small figures, and cameos.

**Zircon** : Clear varieties of this stone are often mistaken for diamonds, but are softer and often flawed. Zircon can be clear, green, golden, or brown.

## Precious Stones

Precious stones are the most highly sought after gems. They are typically faceted, and are popular choices for use in fine jewelry.

**Diamond** : The most popular diamonds are clear, but they can also be golden, pale pink, pink-red, gray-green, or even black. Among the hardest of minerals, only other diamonds can cut these gems. These gems are nearly always faceted.

**Emerald** : These beautiful green gems are rarely flawless, with only brilliant green specimens being truly void of defects or impurities. These gems can be polished into decorative items, but are more often faceted for jewelry.

**Ruby** : Only slightly softer than diamonds, these striking gemstones comes in numerous shades of red, and are often faceted but sometimes shaped and polished into decorative items.

**Sapphire** : Sapphires are structurally almost identical to rubies, but are not red. While they can take on many colors, blue is the most highly sought after kind of sapphire. The most expensive sapphires are star sapphires.

## Creating Jewelry

Jewelry consists of worn ornamental pieces typically adorned with gemstones. To determine the price of a piece of simple jewelry with a single gemstone, treat the piece of jewelry as one grade higher to determine its price (5,000 gp plus 2d4 × 1,000 gp for a grade 6 gemstone). For ornate jewelry with a large number of gemstones (typically 2d6 gemstones of one grade and one gemstone of a grade higher than the others), determine the highest grade gemstone in the item and price the item as if it were two grades higher (25,000 gp plus 2d4 × 5,000 gp for a grade 6 gemstone).

Pieces of jewelry without gemstones are typical worth 10 gp (in the case of copper or silver jewelry), 50 gp (in the case of gold or platinum jewelry), or 100 gp (in the case of mithral, adamantine, or more exotic metals).

Jewelry can be created with a successful [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) (jewelry) check with a DC corresponding to the highest-grade gem in the jewelry or material, but unlike gems, jewelry requires the appropriate raw materials to craft.

# Art Objects

An art object is an item that has value not because of its function, but because of its aesthetics or the historical, religious, or sentimental value placed upon it by a particular culture. The following tables list art objects of value in a traditional fantasy campaign. In some cases, the listed price represents only the typical value of an item; it may have a higher value to a buyer who knows its origin or is descended from the original owner. For example, a painting of a historical queen may fetch a decent price in her home country, but it sells for much more if brought to an agent of the royal family. Likewise, a silver baby rattle is worth a certain amount as a curiosity or plaything for a wealthy merchant's son, but a historian might recognize markings on it that indicate it belonged to an infant prince who was killed in a succession war, and pay a higher price for it. In this way, an art object may easily be used as a plot hook.

The following listings are just examples of art objects. Feel free to alter the shape or nature of an object to make found objects more unique or to suit a campaign. For example, a gold chess set can serve as a different board game, or even a set of soldiers for a prince's war games. A painting of a princess could instead be of a wealthy merchant or beloved religious or musical figure. A comb can be a hairbrush, a chalice can be a goblet, a bowl can be a plate, and so on. When creating new variants for these items, thinking in terms of race, religion, and nationality can inspire countless ideas—a comb may be a dwarven beard-tie, a holy symbol may be of a heretical cult, and a lion statue may be a bear statue to match a country's flag.

Art objects can usually be bought or sold for their base price, and are sometimes used as currency.
