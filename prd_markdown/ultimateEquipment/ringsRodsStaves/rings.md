# Rings

Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges—most magic rings are permanent and potent magic items. Anyone can use a ring.

A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.

**Physical Description:** Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal—usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has AC 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.

**Activation:** A ring's ability is usually activated by a spoken command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity), or its effects may work continually. Some rings have unusual activations, as mentioned in the ring's specific description.

**Special Qualities:** Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (core rulebook 532). rings with charges can never be intelligent.

Decoy Ring

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

This ring is a thick loop of mirrorlike metal. Whenever the wearer of this ring takes the withdraw action or becomes helpless (including falling unconscious), it instantly makes her invisible for 3 rounds and creates four illusory duplicates that either run off in opposite directions or perform other plausible actions that could draw enemy attention away from her. The duplicates last for 3 rounds before disappearing, but they instantly pop out of existence if struck by an attack (AC 10) and can be disbelieved (Will DC 19). Allies of the wearer always know her true location and can freely provide aid or assistance to her.

**Jailer's dungeon ring** 16,000 gp; **Prisoner's dungeon ring** 250 gp

A _jailer's dungeon ring_ is worked gold, set with carnelians. The ring is magically attuned to one or more iron _prisoner's dungeon rings_. When the wearer of a _jailer's ring_ places a _prisoner's ring_ on a subject, the prisoner cannot remove the ring without the use of a _ [remove curse](spells/removeCurse#_remove-curse)_, _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish#_limited-wish), [miracle](spells/miracle#_miracle)_, or _ [wish](spells/wish#_wish)_ spell. The wearer of the _jailer's ring_ can also remove a linked _prisoner's ring_ at any time.

The jailer is aware of any wearer of a linked _prisoner's ring_ as per a constant _ [status](spells/status#_status)_ spell. Additionally, all wearers of linked _prisoner's rings_ count as familiar to the jailer for the purposes of spells such as _ [scrying](spells/scrying#_scrying)_ and _ [teleport](spells/teleport#_teleport)_.

Ring of Animal Friendship

**Price** 10,800 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

A ring of animal friendship always bears some sort of animal-like design in its craftsmanship. On command, this ring affects an animal as if the wearer had cast _ [charm animal](spells/charmAnimal#_charm-animal)_, causing the animal to regard the wearer as a trusted friend.

Ring of Arcane Mastery

**Price** 20,000 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration and evocation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

This ring is a thin but sturdy piece of forged steel crafted to resemble a serpent swallowing its tail, and is magically imbued to reveal the secrets of arcane mastery to its wearer. The ring allows a wearer with an arcane pool to store up to 4 points from his arcane pool in the ring as a swift action. These points remain in the ring until used. A wearer can spend arcane pool points stored in the ring as if they were his own, or can spend them in each of the following ways.

- As a free action, the wearer can expend 1 arcane pool point stored in the ring to gain a +2 bonus on Concentration checks for 1 round.
- As a standard action, the wearer can expend 1 arcane pool point stored in the ring to use the pool strike magus arcana using his own magus level to determine the effect.
- As an immediate action, the wearer can expend up to 4 arcane pool points stored in the ring to use the reflection magus arcana .

Ring of Arcane Signets

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Aura** faint universal; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

The approximately 1-inch-diameter pentagon of emerald green crystal that dominates this otherwise plain silver ring forms itself into a specific rune, sigil, or similar identifying marker each time a person first puts it on. If the wearer expects this to occur, she can cause the crystal to adopt any shape she wishes. If the wearer does not expect this to occur, the crystal instead molds itself into an image that symbolizes the wearer or some dominant facet of her personality. Once the crystal assumes this initial form, it always takes that form whenever the same wearer puts on the ring. The wearer can, as a standard action, embed this image on any object (as if using _ [arcane mark](spells/arcaneMark#_arcane-mark)_) simply by pressing the ring against it. The wearer may choose the color and other cosmetic features of the image each time she uses the ring. The brand is otherwise permanent unless removed by _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic#_dispel-magic)_, _ [erase](spells/erase#_erase)_, or a more powerful spell.

Ring of Chameleon Power

**Price** 12,700 gp; **Aura** faint illusion; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

As a free action, the wearer of this ring can gain the ability to magically blend in with her surroundings. This provides a +10 competence bonus on her [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks. As a standard action, she can also use the spell _ [disguise self](spells/disguiseSelf#_disguise-self)_ as often as she wants.

Ring of Climbing

**Price** 2,500 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This magic ring has the deceptively simple appearance of a plain leather cord that wraps securely around a finger. The ring continually grants the wearer a +5 competence bonus on [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks.

**Cost** 1,250 gp

Ring of Climbing, Improved

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This ring functions as a _ring of climbing_, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on its wearer's [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks.

Ring of Continuation

**Price** 56,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This band of braided copper wires throbs ever so slightly in harmony with its wearer's heartbeat. Whenever the wearer of this ring casts a spell with a range of personal, that spell remains in effect for 24 hours or until the wearer casts another spell with a range of personal (whichever comes first). Spells that usually only affect one specific action (such as making a particular attack) are expended after that action. This does not reduce the duration of spells that normally last longer than 24 hours. Casting a new spell does not eliminate a previous spell if its normal duration is such that it would still be in effect. However, attempts to dispel or otherwise eliminate a spell kept active by the ring work normally and, if successful, remove the spell from the ring, causing the wearer to lose all benefits from that spell.

Ring of Counterspells

**Price** 4,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

Upon first examination, this ring seems to be a _ [ring of spell storing](magicItems/rings#_ring-of-spell-storing-minor)_. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed into it again.

Ring of Craft Magic

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

A _ring of craft magic_ always bears some sort of tool-like design in its craftsmanship. The wearer of the ring sees spells as similar to crafts, and vice versa. The wearer may make a [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) check in place of a [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check to identify an item that could be created with that [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) skill. The wearer may also expend a spell slot or prepared spell to gain an enhancement bonus equal to the level of the expended spell on a single [Craft](skills/craft#_craft) or [Profession](skills/profession#_profession) check (regardless of the amount of time needed to make the check).

Ring of Curing

**Price** 10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

This simple copper ring is a boon to those who spend their lives healing others. Whenever the wearer of a _ring of curing _casts a conjuration spell of the healing subschool, all maximums to the level-dependent healing provided by that spell increase by 2. For example, _ [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds#_cure-light-wounds)_ would provide a maximum healing of 1d8 + 7 (at 7th caster level), while _ [heal](spells/heal#_heal)_ would cure a maximum of 170 points of damage. This ring does not increase the wearer's actual caster level, nor the amount of level-dependent healing provided by any such spell.

Ring of Delayed Doom

**Price** 45,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

Whenever the mind or body of this ring's wearer first becomes subject to any harmful effect that allows a saving throw to resist or mitigate it, he may, as an immediate action, choose to delay the onset of that effect for 1 minute, after he fails the saving throw but before its effects occur. This activation causes one of the ring's nine garnets to turn to powder. When that minute passes, the wearer may continue to delay the onset of this harmful effect an additional minute as an immediate action by willing the ring to do so, which destroys another garnet, thus repeating the cycle for another minute. The delayed harmful effect occurs when the wearer falls unconscious, when the ring is removed, or 1 minute after the last time the ring's power activated; rounds spent delaying the effect do not count toward the effect's duration (for example, a curse that lasts 5 rounds takes effect for a full 5 rounds, even if the wearer delayed its effect several minutes). Effects that protect against or negate the harmful effect work normally while it is delayed. The price of the ring is reduced by 5,000 gp for each of its garnets that ha sbeen destroyed.

Ring of Djinni Calling

**Price** 125,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 17th; **Weight** —

This "genie" ring serves as a special gate by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.

Ring of Ectoplasmic Invigoration

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 6th; **Weight** —

A summoner wearing a _ring of ectoplasmic invigoration_ can use his maker's call class feature to absorb his eidolon (dismissing it in the process) instead of bringing it to his side. He gains 2 temporary hit points per Hit Die of the eidolon and the benefits of a _ [lesser restoration](spells/restoration#_restoration-lesser)_ spell. The eidolon must still be within range of his maker's call ability. Any temporary hit points gained fade after 1 hour or when the eidolon is summoned again. A wearer with the transposition ability can transport himself to the eidolon's square (still absorbing and dismissing it) rather than calling the eidolon to him.

**Cost** 6,000 gp

Forge Ring, the creator must be able to summon an eidolon and have the maker's call class feature

Ring of Elemental Command

**Price** 200,000 gp; **Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th; **Weight** —

All four kinds of _rings of elemental command_ are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of her. If the wearer desires, she may forgo this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as charm monster, Will DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.

Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned that attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. She gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapons he uses bypasses the damage reduction of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.

The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which her ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that she wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if their alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if she is strong. If she is weak, they hate and desire to slay her.

The possessor of a ring of elemental command takes a saving throw penalty as follows.

| Element | Saving Throw Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Air | –2 against earth-based effects |
| Earth | –2 against air- or electricity-based effects |
| Fire | –2 against water- or cold-based effects |
| Water | –2 against fire-based effects |

In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.

**Ring of Elemental Command (Air)**

- _ [Wind wall](spells/windWall#_wind-wall)_ (unlimited use)
- _ [Feather fall](spells/featherFall#_feather-fall)_ (unlimited use, wearer only)
- _ [Resist energy](spells/resistEnergy#_resist-energy) (electricity)_ (unlimited use, wearer only)
- _ [Gust of wind](spells/gustOfWind#_gust-of-wind)_ (twice per day)
- _ [Air walk](spells/airWalk#_air-walk)_ (once per day, wearer only)
- _ [Chain lightning](spells/chainLightning#_chain-lightning)_ (once per week)

This ring appears to be a _ring of feather falling_ until a certain condition is met to activate its full potential. It must be reactivated each time a new wearer acquires it.

**Ring of Elemental Command (Earth)**

This ring appears to be a _ring of [meld into stone](spells/meldIntoStone#_meld-into-stone)_ (allowing the wearer to cast _ [meld into stone](spells/meldIntoStone#_meld-into-stone)_ at will) until the established condition is met.

**Ring of Elemental Command (Fire)**

- _ [Resist energy](spells/resistEnergy#_resist-energy) (fire)_ (as a _major ring of energy resistance [fire]_) 
- _ [Burning hands](spells/burningHands#_burning-hands)_ (unlimited use) 
- _ [Flaming sphere](spells/flamingSphere#_flaming-sphere)_ (twice per day)

- _ [Flame strike](spells/flameStrike#_flame-strike)_ (twice per week)

This ring appears to be a_ major ring of energy resistance (fire) _until the established condition is met.

**Ring of Elemental Command (Water)**

- _ [Create water](spells/createWater#_create-water)_ (unlimited use) 
- _ [Water breathing](spells/waterBreathing#_water-breathing)_ (unlimited use)

Ring of Energy Resistance

**Price** varies; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

**Minor** 12,000 gp; **Major** 28,000 gp; **Greater** 44,000 gp

Rings of this type come in a wide variety of designs and colorations, typically related to the types of energy they defend against. These rings continually protect their wearers from damage from one type of energy—acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic (chosen by the creator of the item; determine randomly if found as part of a treasure hoard). Each time the wearer would normally take such damage, subtract the ring's resistance value from the damage dealt.

A _minor ring of energy resistance_ grants 10 points of resistance. A _major ring of energy resistance_ grants 20 points of resistance. A _greater ring of energy resistance_ grants 30 points of resistance.

Ring of Energy Shroud

**Price** 19,500 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** —

A _ring of energy shroud_ always appears to be glass or crystal in construction, tinted in a red, green, blue, or yellow hue. Closer inspection reveals a small band of metal within the glass or crystal. Treasured by frontline fighters and anyone with a trusted evoker ally, _rings of energy shroud_ normally function as a _minor ring of energy resistance_. However, once per day as an immediate action, the ring's wearer can negate the damage of an incoming acid, cold, electricity, or fire energy effect for himself (but not for other creatures affected by the spell or effect), transforming that damage into a shroud of energy that wreathes the wearer's body acting as if under the effects of the _ [elemental aura](advanced/spells/elementalAura#_elemental-aura)_ spell (_Advanced Player's Guide_). The elemental aura effect has the same energy type of the damage negated.

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate varies; **CL** 11th; **Weight** —

**Lesser** 10,000 gp; **Greater** 16,000 gp; **Superior** 24,000 gp

A _ring of revelation_ is a divine item attuned to a particular oracular mystery and containing a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description). While wearing the ring, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the ring, and must meet the level requirements (if any) of the revelation itself; for example, a _ring of revelation_ (combat healer) is only usable by an oracle of at least 7th level with the battle mystery. If the oracle already has that revelation and the revelation gives an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. The ring has no effect if worn by a non-oracle.

A _lesser ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that has no level prerequisite or a prerequisite that is less than 6th level. A _greater ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 7th level or higher. A _superior ring of revelation_ contains a revelation that requires the oracle to be 11th level or higher.

Ring of Shooting Stars

**Price** 50,000 gp; **Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

This ring has two modes of operation: one for when the wearer is in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night. At night or in areas of shadow or darkness, the _ring of shooting stars_ can perform the following functions on command.

- _ [Dancing lights](spells/dancingLights#_dancing-lights)_ (once per hour)
- _ [Light](spells/light#_light)_ (twice per night)
- Ball lightning (special, once per night)
- Shooting stars (special, three per week)

The first special function, ball lightning, releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble _ [dancing lights](spells/dancingLights#_dancing-lights)_, and the wearer controls them similarly (see the _ [dancing lights](spells/dancingLights#_dancing-lights)_ spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.

| Number of Balls | Damage per Ball |
| --- | --- |
| 1 lightning ball | 2d6 points of electricity damage |
| 2 lightning balls | 3d6 points of electricity damage |
| 3 lightning balls | 2d6 points of electricity damage |
| 4 lightning balls | 1d6 points of electricity damage |

Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.

The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. Upon impact, they deal 12 points of damage and spread (as a _ [fireball](spells/fireball#_fireball)_) in a 5-foot-radius sphere that deals 24 points of fire damage.

Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from the impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it succeeds at a DC 13 Reflex save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 Reflex save. The range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a successful DC 13 Reflex save or be hit by the projectile.

Indoors at night, or underground, the _ring of shooting stars_ has the following properties.

- _ [Faerie fire](spells/faerieFire#_faerie-fire)_ (once per day)
- Spark shower (special, once per day)

The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arch 10 feet wide. Creatures within this area take 2d8 points of damage each if not wearing metal armor or carrying metal weapons. Any creature wearing metal armor and/or carrying a metal weapon takes 4d8 points of damage.

Ring of Spell Knowledge

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate or strong (no school); **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

**Type I** 1,500 gp; **Type II** 6,000 gp; **Type III** 13,500; **Type IV** 24,000 gp

This ring comes in four types: _ring of spell knowledge I, ring of spell knowledge II, ring of spell knowledge III_, and _ring of spell knowledge IV_. All of them are useful only to spontaneous arcane spellcasters. Through study, the wearer can gain the knowledge of a single spell in addition to those allotted by her class and level. A _ring of spell knowledge I_ can hold 1st-level spells only, a _ring of spell knowledge II_ 1st- or 2nd-level spells, a _ring of spell knowledge III_ spells of 3rd level or lower, and a _ring of spell knowledge IV_ up to 4th-level spells.

A _ring of spell knowledge_ is only a storage space; the wearer must still encounter a written, active, or cast version of the spell and succeed at a DC 20 [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check to teach the spell to the ring. Thereafter, the arcane spellcaster may cast the spell as though she knew the spell and it appeared on her class' spell list.

Arcane spells that do not appear on the wearer's class list are treated as one level higher for all purposes (storage and casting).

Ring of Spell Storing

**Price** 50,000 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

A _ [ring of spell storing](magicItems/rings#_ring-of-spell-storing-minor)_ contains up to 5 levels of spells (either divine or arcane, or even a mix of both spell types) that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is the same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.

For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the five-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it.

A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than 5. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the _minor [ring of spell storing](magicItems/rings#_ring-of-spell-storing-minor)_.

The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.

**Price** 2,000 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 1st; **Weight** —

The wearer of this ring can make a melee touch attack against an undead creature no more than one size category larger than himself, cutting off that creature from undying energy. The wearer never suffers any ill effects that might normally occur from coming into physical contact with an undead creature touched in this way. On a successful hit, the undead cannot be healed or aided by the effects of negative energy for 1d4 rounds. During this duration, positive energy affects the undead creature normally.

Ring of the Ram

**Price** 8,600 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

A _ring of the ram_ has a setting crafted to resemble a ram's head. The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ramlike force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.

The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring's caster level as its base attack bonus, with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a Combat Maneuver Bonus of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.

In addition to its attack mode, the _ring of the ram_ also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with a Strength score of 25. This usage expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with a Strength score of 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength score of 29. A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.

Two times per day on command, the wearer of this ring can produce a horrific smell affecting all living creatures other than the wearer within a 10-foot radius. Once created, the smell remains, centered on the wearer, until she dismisses it as a free action. This is a poison effect.

Ring of Transposition

**Price** 10,800 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

Once per day, the wearer of the ring of transposition can speak a command word to exchange places with the creature wearing the bonded ring, which must be within 800 feet, as though using a dimension door spell against a willing target. In the process, the ring of transposition trades places with the ring on the other creature's hand, and the bond between the rings is broken. 

The bonding property of the _ring of transposition_ can be used as often as desired, breaking any existing bond each time it is used. An existing bond can be broken by a successful dispel check against the caster level of the ring.

These four garish and gaudy rings must be worn on one hand, though they take up only a single ring slot. They grant the wearer the ability to commune with and affect the dead in the following ways.

- The wearer can use _ [speak with dead](spells/speakWithDead#_speak-with-dead)_, as the spell, three times per day. It takes 10 minutes to use this ability.
- The wearer can use _ [spectral hand](spells/spectralHand#_spectral-hand)_, as the spell, three times per day.

Steelhand Circle

**Price** 12,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

When this ring is worn, the wielder's skin attains a barely perceptible sheen. In practical terms, the wearer ignores the first 5 points of an object's hardness when performing a sunder combat maneuver or when smashing an object. She also does not take the standard –4 penalty for making a combat maneuver check to disarm while unarmed.

Additionally, the ring's wearer can focus all of the ring's power, possibly repelling a devastating blow. Once per day, when a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a 50% chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally. Using this ability is an immediate action, and the wearer must decide to use it before the critical hit or sneak attack damage is rolled.
