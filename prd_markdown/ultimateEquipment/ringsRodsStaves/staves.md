# Staves

A staff is a long shaft that stores several spells. Staves usually hold spells grouped by a theme, and sometimes possess other abilities that they grant to the wielder. A staff has 10 charges when created, but can be recharged by a spellcaster with the appropriate spells.

**Physical Description** : A typical staff measures anywhere from 4 feet to 7 feet long and is 2 inches to 3 inches thick, weighing about 5 pounds. Most staves are wood, but an exotic few are bone, metal, or even glass. A staff often has a gem or some device at its tip or is shod in metal at one or both ends. Staves are often decorated with carvings or runes. A typical staff also functions as a walking stick, quarterstaff, or cudgel. It has AC 7, 10 hit points, hardness 5, and a break DC of 24.

**Activation** : Staves use the spell trigger activation method, so casting a spell from a staff is usually a standard action that doesn't provoke attacks of opportunity. If the spell being cast has a longer casting time than 1 standard action, however, it takes the full casting time to cast the spell from a staff. To activate a staff, a character must hold it forth in at least one hand (or whatever passes for a hand, for non-humanoid creatures).

**Special Qualities** : Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides some clue to the staff's function, and 31–100 indicates that it has no special qualities.

**Using Staves** : Staves use the wielder's ability score and relevant feats to set the DC for saves against their spells. Unlike with other sorts of magic items, the wielder can use his caster level when activating the power of the staff if it's higher than the caster level of the staff. This means that staves are far more potent in the hands of a powerful spellcaster. Because they use the wielder's ability score to set the save DC for the spells, spells from a staff are often harder to resist than those from other magic items, which use the minimum ability score required to cast the spell. Not only are aspects of the spell dependent on caster level (range, duration, and so on) potentially higher, but spells from a staff are also harder to dispel and have a better chance of overcoming spell resistance.

Staves hold a maximum of 10 charges. Each spell cast from a staff consumes one or more charges. When a staff runs out of charges, it cannot be used until it is recharged. Each morning, when a spellcaster prepares spells or regains spell slots, he can also imbue one staff with a portion of his power, so long as one or more of the spells cast by the staff is on his spell list and he is capable of casting at least one of the spells. Imbuing a staff with this power restores one charge to the staff, but the caster must forgo one prepared spell or spell slot of a level equal to the highest-level spell cast by the staff. A staff cannot gain more than one charge per day, and a caster cannot imbue more than one staff per day.

A staff can hold spells of any level, and the minimum caster level of a staff is 8th.

Each dragon staff is linked to one type of chromatic dragon: black, blue, green, red, or white. All the spells that can be cast using the staff are tied to that choice. If the wielder uses the staff to cast _ [form of the dragon II](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/formOfTheDragon.html#_form-of-the-dragon-ii)_, she must assume the type linked to the staff. Any energy types chosen by spells from the staff must match the type as well (black and green are linked to acid, blue is linked to electricity, red is linked to fire, and white is linked to cold). The staff allows use of the following spells:

In addition to these powers, the wielder of the _dragon staff_ also receives a +2 natural armor bonus to her AC and the ability to make a bite attack as a primary natural weapon. This bite deals 1d8 points of damage if the wielder is Medium. These bonuses are a polymorph effect and are replaced by those gained from casting _ [form of the dragon II](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/formOfTheDragon.html#_form-of-the-dragon-ii)_, or other similar spells.

Staff of Power

**Price** 235,000 gp; **Aura** strong varies; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

A _staff of power _is a potent magic item with varied offensive and defensive abilities, carved from magically hardened wood. It is usually topped with a glistening gem or orb that burns from within with a flickering red light. The staff allows the use of the following spells:

- _ [Continual flame](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/continualFlame.html#_continual-flame) _(1 charge)
- _ [Fireball](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/fireball.html#_fireball)_ (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)
- _ [Levitate](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/levitate.html#_levitate)_ (1 charge)
- _ [Lightning bolt](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/lightningBolt.html#_lightning-bolt)_ (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)
- _ [Magic missile](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/magicMissile.html#_magic-missile)_ (1 charge)
- _ [Ray of enfeeblement](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/rayOfEnfeeblement.html#_ray-of-enfeeblement)_ (heightened to 5th level, 1 charge)
- _ [Cone of cold](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/coneOfCold.html#_cone-of-cold)_ (2 charges)

- _ [Wall of force](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wallOfForce.html#_wall-of-force)_ (in a 10-ft.-diameter hemisphere around the caster only, 2 charges)

The wielder of a _staff of power _gains a +2 luck bonus to AC and on saving throws. The staff is also a _+2 quarterstaff_, and its wielder may use it to smite opponents. If 1 charge is expended (a free action), the staff deals double damage (×3 on a critical hit) for 1 round.

A _staff of power _can be used for a retributive strike, requiring it to be broken by its wielder. (If this breaking of the staff is purposeful and declared by the wielder, it can be performed as a standard action that does not require the wielder to make a Strength check.) All charges currently in the staff are instantly released in a 30-foot spread. All creatures and objects within 2 squares of the broken staff take an amount of damage equal to 20 × the number of charges in the staff, those 3 or 4 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 15 × the number of charges, and those 5 or 6 squares away take an amount of damage equal to 10 × the number of charges. All those affected can make DC 17 Reflex saves to reduce the damage by half.

The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance of traveling to another plane of existence (01–50 on a d%), but if she does not, the explosive release of spell energy instantly destroys her. Only certain items, including the _staff of the magi_ and the _staff of power_, are capable of being used for a retributive strike.
