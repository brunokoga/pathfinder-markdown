# Clothing

These clothes and outfits can be useful to PCs and NPCs who want to dress for special occasions, such as braving an arctic wasteland, attending a gala, sleuthing around an urban setting, or any other situation where specific garb might be beneficial or fitting.

All characters begin play with one outfit valued at 10 gp or less. Additional outfits can be purchased normally.

Artisan's Outfit

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

Artisan's clothing is well made from simple but durable cloth, appropriate for those who must work in various specialized and often manual trades, such as baking, carpentry, and other middle-class professions. This outfit includes a shirt with buttons, a skirt or pants with a drawstring, shoes, and perhaps a cap or hat. It may also include a belt or a leather or cloth apron for carrying tools.

Brooch

**Price** varies; **Weight** —

This is a small ornament used to hold an element of clothing, such as a cloak or cape, in place. Many organizations provide special brooches as a symbol of membership or to honor a special achievement.

Caul

**Price** varies; **Weight** —

This ornate hairnet, fashioned from silk, cloth of gold, and jewels, is most commonly worn by royal or aristocratic women.

Cleats

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Cleats reduce the penalty for walking over slick surfaces by 50%. For example, walking across ice normally costs 2 squares of movement (1 square plus a 1 square penalty) for every square of movement, but with cleats it costs only 1.5 squares for every square. Cleats cause damage to any type of finished flooring. They may supplement another outfit.

Cleric's Vestments

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

These ceremonial clothes are worn when performing priestly functions within a church or temple, and aren't well suited to adventuring. A cleric's vestments typically include a cassock, stole, and surplice. The colors usually correspond to the deity worshiped, and while some priests may choose elaborate embroidery with ecclesiastical themes, others find merit in humble simplicity.

Cold-Weather Outfit

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 7 lbs.

This outfit is designed for mountaineering or hunting and traveling in icy climates. It includes a coat of wool or thick animal fur, a linen shirt, a wool cap, a heavy cloak, a heavy skirt or pants, and waterproof leather boots. In some regions, the outfit may be composed primarily of fur and animal pelts. This outfit grants a +5 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saving throws against exposure to cold weather.

Courtier's Outfit

**Price** 30 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

This outfit includes tailored clothes in whatever fashion happens to be current in noble courts of that region. Anyone trying to influence nobles or courtiers while wearing street dress will have a hard time of it (–2 penalty on Charisma-based skill checks to influence such individuals). If you wear this outfit without jewelry (costing an additional 50 gp), you look like an out-of-place commoner.

Decorative Trim

**Price** varies; **Weight** —

This decorative set of collars, cuffs, and trim pieces attaches to otherwise plain clothes. Frequent travelers, such as merchants or entertainers, use trim to blend in with the local styles without buying a new wardrobe. A traveling noble keeps extra sets for use by temporary staff and loaned guards.

Diving Suit

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This one-piece suit of clothing reduces one's drag in the water, making swimming easier. It provides a +1 circumstance bonus on [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) checks. The suit only grants this bonus if it is the outermost garment, and has no effect if worn over bulky clothes or armor or with cumbersome gear (such as a backpack, large weapons, and so on). Damage to the suit (such as from several rounds of combat against slashing and piercing attacks) negates the suit's bonus until it is repaired.

Entertainer's Outfit

**Price** 3 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This set of flashy—perhaps even gaudy—clothes is meant for entertaining. Entertainer's outfits come in a wide range of styles, from scandalous to flattering to absurd. While the outfit looks whimsical, its practical design does nothing to inhibit your ability to tumble, dance, walk a tightrope, or run (if the audience turns ugly).

Explorer's Outfit

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

This set of clothes is for someone who never knows what to expect. It includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a skirt, a belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), gloves, and a cloak. Rather than a leather skirt, a leather overtunic may be worn over a cloth skirt. The clothes have plenty of pockets (especially the cloak). The outfit also includes any extra accessories you might need, such as a scarf or a wide-brimmed hat.

Fire-Resistant Boots

**Price** 20 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

These heavy leather boots contain a layer of brick dust that protects your feet from heat. You gain fire resistance 2 against fire attacks directed at or under your feet, such as walking across hot coals. Repeat or prolonged exposure to fire damage eventually burns the outer leather of the boots, ruining them (typically after about 1d10+20 rounds   
of exposure).

Furs

**Price** 12 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

The most basic of cold-weather gear, animal furs serve to keep their wearers warm. Wearing enough fur to cover the body provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist cold weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) skill. Furs may supplement another outfit.

Hat

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1/2 lb.–2 lbs.

Hats of various styles appear in all cultures. Ranging from the turban to the tricorne to the furred cap, a hat can be a simple covering for the head. Particular hats are sometimes mandatory for social or religious sects. A utilitarian hat such as a tricorne typically costs 2 sp.

Hennin

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1 lb.

This high conical headpiece ends in a tip that usually has a piece of silk or similar diaphanous material dangling from it. Women of noble birth sometimes wear a hennin to formal or social occasions as a signal of their eligibility, and give the silk part of the headpiece as a token to suitors they favor.

Hot Weather Outfit

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

Covering your body from head to foot in light, airy cloth keeps you cooler than baring your skin to the sun. This outfit typically consists of a loose linen robe and either a turban or loose head covering and veil. The outfit provides a +2 bonus on Fortitude saves to resist warm or hot weather. This does not stack with any bonuses gained from the [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) skill.

Ice Skates

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Each of these calf-high boots bears a vertical blade on the bottom, allowing you to travel swiftly on ice. Wearing ice skates allows you to move on ice at normal speed with a successful DC 5 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check (including running and charging), but your movement is reduced to half speed on all other terrain. Donning or removing an ice skate is a full-round action. Skating with only one is possible, but the DC of the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check rises to 15.

Jewelry

**Price** varies; **Weight** varies

The price of jewelry varies wildly by its quality. Many cultures, particularly nomads, consciously use jewelry as a form of portable wealth, most notably with belts and bangles made from coins. A commoner's ornaments may only be worth a few copper pieces, an artisan's a few silver pieces, and a merchant's a few gold pieces, while nobles rarely wear jewelry worth less than 100 gp.

Kilt

**Price** 2 sp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This heavy pleated skirt is usually worn by men. Most have a specific design or pattern that represents allegiance to a particular clan or other social group.

Mask

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1 lb.

The gala events of decadent nobles are where one might see the most outlandish and stylish of masks, but simpler masks might be found wherever local customs permit. They range from small bits of fabric that cover only a portion of the face to elaborate constructions that cover the entire face or head.

Monk's Outfit

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This simple outfit includes sandals, loose breeches, and a loose shirt, and is bound together with sashes. The outfit is designed to give you maximum mobility, and it's made of high-quality fabric. You can conceal small weapons in pockets hidden in the folds, and the sashes are strong enough to serve as short ropes.

Monster Mask

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1 lb.

This articulated mask resembles a specific type of humanoid monster, such as a bugbear, goblin, orc, or hobgoblin. The mouth opens and closes when you move your jaw and its skin is actually carefully-painted cloth. Though such masks are usually intended for theater performances where an actor plays the role of a monster, adventurers have been known to use them to help blend in with monsters of the appropriate type. The mask negates the –2 [Disguise](skills/disguise.md#_disguise) DC for disguising yourself as a different race, but only at a distance of at least 20 feet or when you have concealment; closer than this distance or in clearer circumstances, the mask is obviously a false representation. It only covers your face and is normally worn with a wig or helmet to disguise or cover the rest of your head. Each mask is most suitable for a wearer of a particular size, though some size and monster combinations are less believable than others (a Small creature in an orc mask may be able to pass as an orc child, but a Medium creature in a goblin mask at best looks like a deformed hobgoblin).

Noble's Outfit

**Price** 75 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

These clothes are designed specifically to be expensive and gaudy, letting everyone know exactly how expensive they are. Precious metals and gems are worked into the clothing, along with elaborate embroidery, and some outfits may contain impractical concessions to high fashion. A would-be noble also needs a signet ring and jewelry (worth at least 100 gp) to accessorize this outfit.

Patchwork Cloak

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

These cloaks are popular among traveling bards, and each patchwork cloak is unique. The patches represent where the traveler has been, and often the performer uses them to recall specific stories from his repertoire. When a bard retires or dies, he often bequeaths his cloak to a young entertainer he mentored or admired.

Peasant's Outfit

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

These clothes are of poor quality, the fabric little more than sack cloth, often patched and mended many times over. A peasant's outfit consists of a loose shirt and baggy breeches, or a loose shirt and skirt or overdress. Cloth wrappings are used for shoes, causing significantly more wear on the feet.

Pickpocket's Outfit

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

Outfitted with concealed pockets, this clothing gives you a +2 bonus when hiding small objects on your person.

Pocketed Scarf

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

An elaborate design disguises several small pockets on one side of this scarf. This scarf grants you a +4 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks made to hide objects on your body. This bonus does not stack with the bonus wearing heavy clothing provides but does stack with bonuses for attempting to hide small objects.

Poncho

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This circle of water-resistant fabric (typically wool or leather) has a hooded opening in the center, making it easy to slip it on or off and protecting your entire body from rain or snow.

Reinforced Scarf

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

One side of this 8-foot-long scarf is reinforced with chain links and metal plates. While not enough to provide a benefit to Armor Class, these versatile scarves can be used like a length of chain to climb short distances or bind an enemy. A reinforced scarf has hardness 10 and 4 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 24 Strength check.

Reversible Cloak

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1 lb.

This cloak has an outer layer of fabric and an inner layer of a different color. They are worn for the sake of fashion, in theater performances, or to aid a quick appearance change as part of a disguise. The price varies depending on the cloak's quality, with the low end being a simple linen cloak and the high end being made of silk or decorated with fur trim.

Royal Outfit

**Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 15 lbs.

Royal clothes are ostentatious, with gems, gold, silk, and fur in abundance. A royal outfit is rarely designed for regular wear or inclement weather—or even for donning unaided—as it's presumed that anyone who might be wearing it has plenty of servants to take care of his or her every need. This outfit includes only the clothing, not a royal scepter, crown, ring, or other regal accoutrements.

Scarf

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Entertainers often employ seductive garb and entrancing props in their performances. Scarves of colorful cloth or transparent silk, often embroidered with elaborate scenes or motifs, are favorite accessories.

Scholar's Outfit

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

Perfect for a scholar, this outfit includes a robe, a belt, a cap, soft shoes, and possibly a cloak.

skis

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 20 lb.

Each ski is a flat piece of wood about 5–6 feet long for a Medium wearer, curled up slightly at the front end, with lengthwise grooves along the underside and a wooden or metal bracket with laces on top for holding the wearer's boot in place. Wearing skis allows you to move on snow and ice at normal speed, but your movement is reduced to 5 feet on all other terrain. You normally use a pair of spiked poles to help you move and maintain balance while skiing, but javelins, shortspears, or even trimmed-down saplings will do if nothing else more suitable is available. Donning or removing a ski is a full-round action, though the laces can be cut as a move action (which requires repairing or replacing the laces if you want to use the skis again).

Snowshoes

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

These high-tension nets of rope or sinew in wooden frames are lashed to the feet to spread your weight across the snow, making you much less likely to break through the crust and rendering walking much easier. Snowshoes reduce the penalty for walking through heavy snow by 50%; for example, if moving through snow normally costs you 2 squares of movement (1 square plus a 1 square penalty) per square traveled, snowshoes reduce this cost to 1.5 squares per square traveled. Snowshoes may supplement another outfit.

Soldier's Uniform

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

The exact details of this item varies from country to country, but typically includes sturdy boots, leather breeches or a kilt, a belt, a shirt, gloves, a cloak or jacket, and a hat. The belt includes several loops or rings for tying pouches, a waterskin, a scabbard, and similar things a traveling soldier requires.

Tabard

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

Often worn over armor, this outer garment is usually sleeveless and open at the sides. The broad front provides a canvas for insignias and coats of arms, making a wearer's membership in an order readily apparent.

Tear-Away Clothing

**Price** +5 gp; **Weight** —

Sneaks and thieves know the value of a good disguise. The ability to remove that disguise in a hurry, thus revealing the next layer of disguise, is nearly as valuable. Tear-away clothing is generally loose fitting and allows another layer of clothing to be worn underneath. The seams on this clothing are designed to break easily, making it a simple matter (a standard action) to remove these items and walk away with none the wiser. Any outfit can be crafted as tear-away clothing for an additional price.

Traveler's Outfit

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This set of clothes consists of boots, a wool skirt or breeches, a sturdy belt, a shirt (perhaps with a vest or jacket), and an ample cloak with a hood.

Wig

**Price** varies; **Weight** 1/2 lb.–4 lbs.

False hair comes in many forms, from the severe coif of a judge to the towering confection adorning a noble to the simple curls worn by a housewife whose hair is thinning. Wigs can be found for sale in any major city and can be special-ordered in most towns. As they are usually made of hair, the available colors are likely limited by the locally predominant hair color, but others can be obtained by applying dye.
