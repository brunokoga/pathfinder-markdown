Air Bladder

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Used by swimmers for longer dives, this bladder is similar to a waterskin, but is relatively airtight. If inflated, it holds enough air to sustain a Medium creature for 1 round or a Small creature for 2 rounds.

alchemist's kit

**Price** 40 gp; **Weight** 24 lbs.

This kit includes an alchemy crafting kit, a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a formula book because an alchemist begins play with a formula book and does not need to purchase one.

Animal Glue

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This simple glue is created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into a ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check. Animal glue slowly dissolves in water, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per 10 minutes. It softens if heated, even with steam, reducing the Strength DC needed to break it by 1 per minute.

Area Map

**Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

A geographically relevant map grants a user a +1 circumstance bonus on [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) checks made to navigate in the wilderness. It also can be used to grant the same bonus on [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (dungeoneering) checks made to navigate underground.

Astrolabe

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** 6 lbs.

This device consists of a flat disc upon which two other discs are mounted. The mounted discs can rotate on a central axis, allowing them to spin and move as days pass. The bottom disc represents the latitude of the user; an astrolabe is useless if the user is outside the preset latitude. The upper disc represents the sky, and is filled with astronomical features. Anyone can be shown how to use an astrolabe at night to determine the date and time (which takes 1 minute). When using an astrolabe, you can make a [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) check using your Intelligence modifier instead of your Wisdom modifier to avoid becoming lost.

Backpack

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 2 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Masterwork | 50 gp | 4 lbs. |

This leather knapsack has one large pocket that closes with a buckled strap and holds about 2 cubic feet of material. Some may have one or more smaller pockets on the sides.

_Masterwork Backpack_: This backpack has numerous pockets for storing items that might be needed while adventuring. Hooks are included for attaching items such as canteens, pouches, or even a rolled-up blanket. It has padded bands that strap across the chest and the waist to distribute its weight more evenly. Like a common backpack, it can hold about 2 cubic feet of material in its main container. When wearing a masterwork backpack, treat your Strength score as +1 higher than normal when calculating your carrying capacity.

Bandolier

**Price** 5 SP; **Weight** —

This leather belt is worn over one shoulder and runs diagonally across the chest and back. It has small loops or pouches for holding eight objects the size of a flask or small dagger. You can use the "retrieve a stored item" action to take an item from a bandolier. You can wear up to two bandoliers at the same time (any more than this and they get in each other's way and restrict your movement).

Banner

**Price** 1–20 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This is a banner, flag, or pennant. You tie it to a pole, lance, or polearm. Most are woven, dyed, or painted with a pattern or symbol, such as a knight's crest or a country's flag. A simple banner with one field color and a simple insignia such as a weapon or shield costs 1 gp. A banner with two to four field colors and a complex insignia such as a lion or dragon costs 5 gp. A detailed banner with four or more field colors and a very complex insignia, such as a heraldic device with eight or more sections, costs 20 gp.

Barbarian's kit

**Price** 9 gp; **Weight** 26 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a belt pouch, a blanket, a flint and steel, an iron pot, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

Barbed Vest

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

Thin leather flaps keep the hundreds of tiny, fishhook-like needles dotting the surface of this black vest from harming you while you wear it. However, any creature that injures you with a natural or unarmed attack must make a DC 15 Reflex save or take 1 point of damage. If a creature swallows you, it takes 1 point of damage each round until it either spits you up, you escape, or you die (at which point the vest has sustained enough damage that it no longer serves as a threat). The vest can only be worn over light armor or no armor.

Bard's kit

**Price** 41 gp; **Weight** 33-1/2 lbs.

This includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a common musical instrument, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a journal, a mess kit, a mirror, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

Barrel

**Price** 2 gp; **Weight** 30 lbs.

This is a sturdy wooden barrel with a tight-fitting lid, banded with metal.

basket

**Price** 4 sp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This large basket has a lid and holds about 2 cubic feet.

bedroll

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This consists of two woolen sheets sewn together along the bottom and one side to create a bag for sleeping in. Some have cloth straps along the open side so the bedroll can be tied closed while you are sleeping. It can be rolled and tied into a tight coil for storage or transport. Most people use a blanket with the bedroll to stay warm or provide a ground cushion.

Bell

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** —

This handbell can produce only one loud note.

bell net

**Price** 2 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Copper bells hang at each the corners of this 5-foot-by-5-foot wire net. A bell net is designed to blanket gear while you sleep, hunt, cook, or otherwise can't give it your full attention, rasing an alarm if your possessions are disturbed. Creatures attempting to access gear protected by a bell net must succeed at a DC 25 [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) check to avoid chiming the bells. Hearing the chiming bells of a bell net requires a DC 0 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check. Because the many bells chime when you move, traveling with a bell net gives you a –2 penalty on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks.

belt Pouch

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

A typical leather or cloth belt pouch has a leather cord to cinch it shut and another to tie it to your belt. It is large enough to hold 100–200 coins or two apples.

blanket

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This warm, woven blanket has straps so it can be rolled up and tied. Blankets are often used in conjunction with bedrolls to provide additional warmth or a ground cushion.

Block and Tackle

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

Whether it is used to hoist treasure from a pit or move supplies, a simple block-and-tackle pulley, when it is properly secured, adds a +5 circumstance bonus on Strength checks to lift heavy objects. Securing the pulley requires 1 minute.

blue book

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This book details the seedier entertainment establishments in one major city. It contains the names of brothels, burlesque houses, and gambling halls in that city. By consulting the book for 1 hour, for the next 24 hours you gain a +2 circumstance bonus on [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (local), [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff), and [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) checks to gather or use information in that city. At the GM's discretion, you can use it in settlements near that city for a +1 bonus.

book of letters

**Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This portfolio contains examples of official letters along with proper forms of address, etiquette, and turns of phrase. Used by bureaucrats, diplomats, and clerks, it's also useful for counterfeiting official correspondence. It provides a +2 circumstance bonus on [Diplomacy](skills/diplomacy.md#_diplomacy) checks when dealing with city officials and a +2 circumstance bonus on [Linguistics](skills/linguistics.md#_linguistics) checks when creating forgeries. A book of letters is only accurate for a particular region, such as a country or even a town, and only provides its bonus relating to that region.

bottle

**Price** 2 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This glass bottle holds about a pint and includes a cork.

breakaway chains

**Price** 65 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

These masterwork chains are easy to break, even though they look like normal chains ( [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) DC 25 to notice the difference). A DC 10 Strength check breaks them instantly.

bucket

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

A typical bucket has a rope handle and can hold 1–2 gallons of liquid.

bullseye lantern

**Price** 12 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

A bullseye lantern provides normal light in a 60-foot cone and increases the light level by one step in the area beyond that, out to a 120-foot cone (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A bullseye lantern does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. A lantern burns for 6 hours on 1 pint of oil. You can carry a lantern in one hand.

Buoy

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 5 gp | 16 lbs. |
| Superior | 10 gp | 30 lbs. |

A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention. Though anchor buoys prove quite resilient to normal weather and tides, they offer little challenge to intelligent creatures determined to sabotage them. A superior buoy has a spherical or ovoid hollow metal float (typically copper), a length of chain rather than twine, and a metal anchor rather than a weight.

butterfly net

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

One end of this 6-foot-long pole supports a wide metal hoop covered by a thin mesh net. You can use this to sift objects from material capable of passing through the net, such as sand or water. You can also use a butterfly net to capture Fine or Diminutive creatures as if it were a net (weapon), though you don't need to re-fold the butterfly net if you miss, and you use the handle of the butterfly net like you would the rope of a net weapon.

caltrops

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong always faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square.

Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 [Heal](skills/heal.md#_heal) check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble.

Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents.

camouflage netting

**Price** 20 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth is used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position.

You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) check with a –10 penalty and use the total as the [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) check result for the object. Creatures who fail a [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check against this [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) check penalty is –20 instead of –10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) check penalty is –30 instead of –10.

A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage.

These manacles are nearly indistinguishable from standard manacles upon inspection ( [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) DC 25).

These chests are typically used by smugglers transporting contraband or those with treasures they would prefer to keep hidden. The secret compartment in this chest is approximately 1 inch deep.

This hinged pole can be unfolded and locked in place with sliding pins, creating a 10-foot pole. When collapsed, it is only 3 feet long. Assembling or collapsing the pole is a full-round action.

This 1-foot-square piece of paper is coated on one side with a weak glue or sticky material such as tree sap or even honey. It is stored folded in half.

hip flask

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Like using holy water on incorporeal opponent, you unstopper the flask and pour the contents onto an adjacent target. Detecting the compartment requires a successful DC 10 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check.

holy symbol, tattoo

**Price** 100 gp; **Weight** —

In some religions, you are allowed to tattoo or brand your deity's holy symbol onto your skin (typically the palm, back of the hand, or forearm) in a special ceremony. Thereafter, it functions like an actual holy symbol of your faith, and you may use it as a divine focus for spellcasting, channeling energy, and so on. The tattoo must be fully visible to use it in this way (it cannot be covered with a glove, gauntlet, or any other material).

Magnifying Glass

**Price** 100 gp; **Weight** —

This simple lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for a flint and steel when starting fires.

A magnifying glass grants a +2 circumstance bonus on [Appraise](skills/appraise.md#_appraise) checks involving any item that is small or highly detailed.

magus's kit

**Price** 22 gp; **Weight** 31 lbs.

This includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, rope, soap, a spell component pouch, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a spellbook because a magus begins play with a spellbook.

manacles

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 15 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Masterwork | 50 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Mithral | 1,000 gp | 2 lbs. |

Manacles can bind a Medium creature. A manacled creature can use the [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) skill to slip free (DC 30, or DC 35 for masterwork manacles). Breaking the manacles requires a Strength check (DC 26, or DC 28 for masterwork manacles). Manacles have hardness 10 and 10 hit points.

Most manacles have locks; add the cost of the lock you want to the price of the manacles.

For the same price, you can buy manacles for a Small creature. For a Large creature, manacles cost 10 times the indicated amount, and for a Huge creature, 100 times the indicated amount. Gargantuan, Colossal, Tiny, Diminutive, and Fine creatures can be held only by specially made manacles, which cost at least 100 times the indicated amount.

_Mithral Manacles_: These bindings are more difficult to break than standard manacles and are particularly useful against lycanthropes. They have hardness 15, 30 hit points, and a break DC of 30. They are otherwise treated as masterwork manacles

Marbles

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Marbles can be used to slow opponents. One 2-pound bag of marbles covers an area 5 feet square. A creature entering a square with marbles scattered on it must succeed at a DC 10 Reflex save or fall prone (the creature's stability bonus to trip applies to this save). Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a square of marbles with no trouble.

mess kit

**Price** 2 sp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This kit includes a plate, bowl, cup, fork, knife, and spoon, made of wood, horn, or tin. Each item has a handle or small hole, and can be tied together using the included leather cord.

Miner's Pick

**Price** 3 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

If a miner's pick is used in combat, treat it as a two-handed improvised weapon that deals piercing damage equal to that of a heavy pick of its size.

mirror

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This hand-held mirror is about a foot across. Unlike many higher-quality glass mirrors, this one is made out of polished steel and sturdy enough that you can drop it without risk of breakage.

Mock Armor

**Price** 90 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

When an arcane caster needs a disguise, she might don a suit of mock armor. Made from leather or thin wood such as balsa or bamboo and painted to look like metal, a suit of mock armor passes as full plate under all but the closest scrutiny. A character inspecting someone in mock armor must succeed at a DC 20 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check to identify it as fake. Mock armor gives you no Armor Class bonus, doesn't affect your maximum Dexterity bonus, and has no armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, or speed reduction. It cannot be given magical armor abilities, whether enhancement bonuses or properties like _ [fortification](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-fortification)_ or _ [ghost touch](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-ghost-touch)_. When wearing mock armor, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff) checks to conceal your identity or allegiance as a spellcaster (for example, in cities where arcane spellcasting is illegal). The [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) (carpentry) or [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) (leather) DC to create mock armor is 25.

monk's kit

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 22 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a belt pouch, a blanket, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

Mug/Tankard

**Price** 2 cp; **Weight** 1 lbs.

Whether it is a simple pottery cup or an elaborate drinking stein with a handle and decorative lid that flips up, this cup may be used to hold any sort of beverage. Tankards are commonly made out of clay or tin.

Oil

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 1 lbs.

A 1-pint flask of oil burns for 6 hours in a lantern or lamp. You can also use a flask of oil as a splash weapon. Use the rules for alchemist's fire, except that it takes a full-round action to prepare a flask with a fuse. Once it is thrown, there is a 50% chance of the flask igniting successfully.

You can pour a pint of oil on the ground to cover an area 5 feet square, provided that the surface is smooth. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 1d3 points of fire damage to each creature in the area.

oracle's kit

**Price** 9 gp; **Weight** 29 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, candles (10), a flint and steel, an iron pot, mess kit, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a cheap holy text, a flint and steel, an iron pot, a mess kit, rope, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), a waterskin, and a wooden holy symbol.

Paper (sheeT)

A sheet of ordinary paper typically measures 9 inches by 6 inches and is unsuitable for making magical scrolls. It has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 5.

Parchment (sheet)

**Price** 2 sp; **Weight** —

This sheet of thin, treated animal skin is a durable writing surface and is suitable for making magic scrolls. It has hardness 0, 2 hit points, and a break DC of 5.

pathfinder's kit

**Price** 12 gp; **Weight** 22 lbs.

This kit consists of a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a clay mug, a dagger, two fishhooks, a flint and steel, a sewing needle, a signal whistle, 50 feet of string, 50 feet of thread, a waterskin, a week's worth of trail rations, and a whetstone. For Small creatures, the weight of a Pathfinder's kit is 7-1/2 pounds. Leaving the bedroll and rations at camp or on a mount reduces the weight by 12 pounds for Medium creatures and by 3 pounds for Small creatures.

Perfume/Cologne

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** —

Most perfumes and colognes are derived from the essential oils of flowers. Perfume or cologne may (at the GM's discretion) provide a +1 circumstance bonus on several Charisma-based skill checks.

periscope

**Price** 20 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head where wouldn't fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube's Diminutive size modifier on your [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) check instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a –4 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors.

pitcher

**Price** 2 cp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This basic clay pitcher has a handle and an open top with a groove for easy pouring. It holds 1/2 gallon of liquid. The listed weight is for a pitcher filled with water, wine, or ale; empty, it weighs about 1/2 pound.

Piton

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

A piton is an iron spike with a loop or ring on the end so you can tie a rope to it.

Poison Pill Ring

**Price** +20 gp; **Weight** —

This ring has a tiny compartment under the setting, typically used to hold poison. Opening and closing a ring is a move action; doing so unseen requires a DC 20 [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) check.

poisoning sheath

**Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This scabbard contains strips of natural sea sponges on its interior. By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (a full-round action), you saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up to 4 hours. Preparing the scabbard carries the normal risk of poisoning yourself, just like poisoning a weapon. The next weapon you draw from the scabbard is automatically poisoned as if you had directly applied poison to it (but does not risk poisoning you); this consumes the poison in the scabbard. A scabbard only fits one type of bladed weapon, such as a dagger, shortsword, or longsword. This kind of item is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison.

Pole

**Price** 5 cp; **Weight** 8 lbs.

This 10-foot length of wood is useful for probing pits, flagstones, and murky liquids from a safe distance.

portable bridge

**Price** 200 gp; **Weight** 60 lbs.

When staked down with eight pitons (four on each side of the gap), this rope and slat bridge can support up to 1,500 pounds and span a 30-foot gap. It rolls up into a parcel that can be carried slung over the back or by a pack animal. Convincing an animal to cross a portable bridge requires the come or heel trick.

Portable Ram

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 20 lbs.

This iron-shod wooden beam gives you a +2 circumstance bonus on Strength checks made to break open a door and allows a second person to help, automatically increasing your bonus by +2.

Pot

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 8 sp | 4 lbs. |
| Mithral | 1,0001 gp | 2 lbs. |

This 8-inch-diameter iron pot is sturdy and has feet, a lid, and a rounded handle. It can hold enough stew to feed one hungry human for one meal. A mithral pot is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.

Powder

**Price** 1 CP; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals whether an invisible creature is there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.

Powder horn

**Price** 3 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into the barrel of a firearm.

Prosthetic

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Arm | 10 gp | 3 lbs. |
| Foot | 1 gp | 2 lbs. |
| Hand | 1 gp | 1 lbs. |
| Leg | 20 gp | 6 lbs. |

People who lose hands, arms, legs, or feet in combat sometimes replace them with prosthetics: realistic simulations of their missing limbs. Usually carved of wood and painted to match the wearer's skin tone, these items have limited functionality, allowing a legless person to walk at half speed, or enabling an armless person to hold a shield in a fixed position, but little more. Clever individuals have been known to create small compartments in their prosthetics, just large enough to hold very small objects. A prosthetic hand or foot can hold an item with negligible weight, while a prosthetic limb can hold up to 1 or 2 pounds.

Pyrography Kit

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Also called a "woodburning kit," this set of metal needles, styluses, and brands is used to draw on leather or wood by burning it. Using the kit requires a fire source; the needle or stylus is heated in the fire and held in a thick leather handle, then used like a pen.

Ranger's kit

**Price** 9 gp; **Weight** 28 lbs.

This includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, iron pot, mess kit, rope, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

rice paper (sheet)

**Price** 5 cp; **Weight** —

This sheet of paper is made of rice, straw, or tree bark. It has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 2.

riding Kit

| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 16 gp | 54 lbs. |
| Exotic Mount | 36 gp | 59 lbs. |

This kit includes a bit and bridle, a saddle, a saddle blanket, saddlebags, and 2 days' worth of feed for a mount. The weight can be lightened 10 pounds by discarding the feed.

This 50-foot length of hemp rope has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 23 Strength check.

sack

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This heavy canvas sack, useful for carrying adventuring gear and other supplies, holds about 4 cubic feet. A leather thong threaded through loops at the bag's end allows it to be tied shut easily.

Saw

**Price** 4 CP; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Saws can take many different shapes, from small carpentry saws to the long, two-handled saws used by lumberjacks. You can insert a saw between a door and its frame to cut through wooden bolts or bars, dealing 5 hit points per round plus your Strength modifier to the sawed object as a full-round action. Hearing the sawing requires a successful DC 10 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check. Saws used to cut ice on rivers have a point on the end to break through the ice before cutting.

Sawback Sword

**Price** +5 gp; **Weight** —

This is a modification to any light or heavy blade rather than a unique weapon type. The saw blade on the back of the sword lets you use it to perform crude carpentry.

scrivener's kit

**Price** 2 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This soft leather case contains a vial for holding ink, an ink pen, spare pen nibs, a small container of pigment for making ink, a tiny knife for cutting quills into pens, a blotter, and a small ruler.

scroll box

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This wooden box easily holds 10 scrolls and has small clips or bookmarks for easier indexing. Retrieving a scroll from a held scroll box is a move action. A scroll box has hardness 5, 5 hit points, a break DC of 20. A scroll box is water-tight.

Scroll Case

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram more inside, but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, break DC 15). A scroll case is not watertight, and must still be protected from the elements.

Sealing Wax

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This stick of red wax is used to seal envelopes, often using an impression from a signet ring as proof they were sent by you.

Sentry Mannequin

**Price** 30 gp; **Weight** 35 lbs.

After 5 minutes of assembly and coverage with the included loose hood and baggy clothing, this wooden frame looks like a vigilant humanoid figure. Creatures more than 30 feet distant from it must succeed at a DC 10 [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check in order to realize it is not someone standing watch.

Sewing Needle

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** —

This needle allows you to stitch together cloth, canvas, or thin leather.

Sextant

**Price** 500 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

A sextant is used to determine your latitude. Using a sextant with an astrolabe gives you a +4 circumstance bonus on [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) checks made to prevent getting lost.

SHAVING KIT

**Price** 15 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

A shaving kit contains a straight razor, a whetstone, a small mirror, a brush, a cup, and enough shaving powder to last a Medium humanoid 50 shaves.

shield Sconce

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This metal frame holds a torch and is designed to be strapped to the front of a light, heavy, or tower shield, allowing you to carry a torch without giving up your shield or occupying your weapon hand.

Shovel

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 2 gp | 8 lbs. |
| Folding | 12 gp | 12 lbs. |

This tool lets you dig a pit at a rate of 2 cubic feet per minute. If a shovel is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a club of its size.

_Folding Shovel_: A folding shovel is a full-sized shovel with a sturdy sectional handle that folds into pieces no longer than the shovel blade, allowing it to fit in a smaller space such as a backpack. Converting the shovel from its folded state to usable (or vice versa) is 2 full-round actions.

signal horn

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Sounding a horn requires a DC 10 [Perform](skills/perform.md#_perform) (wind instruments) check and can convey concepts such as "Attack!", "Help!", "Advance!", "Retreat!", "Fire!", and "Alarm!" The report of a signal horn can be clearly heard ( [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) DC 0) up to a half-mile distant. For each quarter-mile beyond, [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks to hear the horn take a –1 penalty.

Signal Whistle

**Price** 8 sp; **Weight** —

With a DC 5 [Perform](skills/perform.md#_perform) (wind instruments) check, you can use a whistle to signal the same sorts of situations as signal horns. A whistle's piercing report can be clearly heard ( [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) DC 0) up to a quarter-mile away. For each quarter-mile beyond, [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks to hear a whistle take a –2 penalty. Silent whistles that only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear also exist.

Signet Ring

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** —

This ring has an embossed design, typically a family crest or official icon. You press a signet ring into softened wax to leave an impression of this symbol.

Silent Whistle

**Price** 9 sp; **Weight** —

Only animals and other creatures with keen hearing can hear this whistle.

Silk Rope

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This 50-foot length of silk rope has 4 hit points and can be broken with a DC 24 Strength check.

Skeleton Key

**Price** 85 gp; **Weight** —

Many door locks have a similar design and thus can be unlocked by a similar key. A skeleton key may be tried on any standard door lock that uses a key, even if you don't have the [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) skill. You use the key's [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) bonus of +10 rather than your own total; you cannot take 10 when using a skeleton key. The key only gets one roll for any particular lock. If the roll fails, the key is unable to open or close that lock. Inferior skeleton keys may only have a +5 bonus.

Skillet

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 8 sp | 4 lbs. |
| Mithral | 1,001 gp | 2 lbs. |

This 8-inch-diameter skillet has a long handle and feet so you can rest it on a fire or hot coals. Adventurers prefer models with a hinged handle that folds over the top of the skillet for easier storage and transport. A mithral skillet is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.

sledge

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

This heavy, two-handed hammer is normally used in carpentry and other construction tasks, and is also useful for driving in tent stakes to help secure campsites in areas with strong winds. If used in combat, treat it as an improvised earth breaker (see page 27).

Smoked Goggles

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** —

These spectacles have lenses made of smoked glass that help protect against creatures with gaze attacks. You are always treated as averting your gaze when dealing with gaze attacks, and you gain a +8 circumstance bonus on saving throws against visual-based attacks (any attack that a blind creature would be immune to). You take a –4 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) checks while wearing the goggles, and all opponents are treated as having concealment (20% miss chance).

snorkel

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 5 sp | — |
| Masterwork | 5 gp | — |

This waterproof wooden tube has a curved end with a mouthpiece. When you hold the mouthpiece in your mouth, the tube extends past your face and toward the back of your head, allowing you to breathe indefinitely when swimming facedown or barely submerged. If you submerge the tip of the snorkel, it floods with water and can't be used to breathe until you clear the water from it (requiring a move action and full access to air). A typical snorkel's length is about 15 inches; any shorter than this and it tends to fill with water when you swim, but any longer and you're not moving enough fresh air through the snorkel to be effective.

_Masterwork Snorkel_: This snorkel has a valve at the top to keep out of the water, keeping it from being flooded from splashes or when you submerge. It also has a sump and valve near your mouth, preventing water from reaching your mouth and automatically draining excess water when you surface.

soap

**Price** 1 cp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Most soap is made from animal fat and lye derived from ashes. You can use this thick block of soap to scrub clothes, pots, linens, adventurers, or anything else that might be dirty. A bar of soap has approximately 50 uses.

Sorcerer's kit

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 19 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

This kit holds equipment for exploring underground, consisting of a lantern with 4 flasks of oil, a hammer and 8 pitons, 100 feet of silk rope, a grappling hook, and a climber's kit.

Spider's Silk Rope

**Price** 100 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This 50-foot length of rope is woven of strands of silk from monstrous spiders. Rare to virtually nonexistent on the surface world, it is commonly used by the dark elves, though shorter spider's silk rope scraps (generally no more than 10 feet long) occasionally appear among goblins. Spider's silk rope has 6 hit points and can be broken with a DC 25 Strength check.

Spyglass

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size. Characters using a spyglass take a –1 penalty on [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) skill checks per 20 feet of distance to the target, if the target is visible.

Stationery

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** —

Generally used only by the wealthy, fancy stationery is a finer-quality 9-inch-by-6-inch paper, often embossed or engraved with the owner's personal seal.

Stilts

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 2 sp | 10 lbs. |
| Masterwork | 5 gp | 10 lbs. |

This item consists of a pair of wooden poles with a footrest halfway up. By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check.

You must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20.

Stilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk.

_Masterwork Stilts_: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty. Walking on masterwork stilts requires a DC 10 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check. Attaching or removing a masterwork stilt is a full-round action.

Stove Can

**Price** 10 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This little metal container holds a waxy fuel that creates enough heat to cook with but only as much light as a candle. To snuff the flame, close the metal lid on the container; it cools enough that it can be carried in a few minutes. Each lasts 5 hours (enough to cook about 10 meals).

String or Twine

**Price** 1 cp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

Sold in balls or spools of 50 feet, string and twine are useful for rigging traps and alarms and are a vital component of grappling bolts and arrows. String or twine has hardness 0, 1 hit point, and a break DC of 14.

Summoner's kit

**Price** 8 gp; **Weight** 19 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

survival Kit

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 5 gp | 4 lbs. |
| Masterwork | 50 gp | 5 lbs. |

A survival kit provides the necessary tools for day-to-day existence in a temperate wilderness. It typically contains a flint and steel, a mess kit, two waterskins (enough to hold water for 1 person for 1 day), very basic maps showing major landmarks, and a small utility knife.

A masterwork survival kit contains higher quality gear and a guide to identifying flora and fauna. It grants you a +2 circumstance bonus on [Survival](skills/survival.md#_survival) checks to get along in the wild, deal with severe weather, keep from getting lost, avoid natural hazards such as quicksand, and predict the weather.

Swarmsuit

**Price** 20 gp; **Weight** 10 lbs.

These heavy and overlapping layers of clothing, coupled with a wide hat outfitted with a dense, veil-like netting around its brim, makes it all but impossible for Diminutive and Fine creatures to make physical contact with your body. Wearing a swarmsuit cuts your speed in half, but gives you DR 10/— against swarms of Fine creatures and DR 5/— against swarms of Diminutive creatures.

tattoo

**Price** 1 cp – 20 gp; **Weight** —

The price of a tattoo depends on the quality, size, and number of colors used. A coin-sized tattoo in blue ink that will blur over a decade costs 1 cp, a hand-sized one in black ink that won't fade costs 1 sp, and a tattoo covering an entire back takes several sessions and costs 10 gp. Each additional color costs as much as a single tattoo of its size. While these prices represent the baseline, tattoos—like any other artwork—can be worth far more depending on the prestige of the artist.

Teapot

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This is a small spouted pot for cooking tea. It includes a lid and a strainer, and can make four cups of tea at a time.

Tent

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Small | 10 gp | 20 lbs. |
| Medium | 15 gp | 30 lbs. |
| Large | 30 gp | 40 lbs. |
| Pavilion | 100 gp | 50 lbs. |

Tents come in a variety of sizes and accommodate between one and 10 people. A small tent holds one Medium creature and takes 20 minutes to assemble, a medium tent holds two creatures and takes 30 minutes, a large tent holds four creatures and takes 45 minutes, and a pavilion holds 10 creatures and takes 90 minutes (two Small creatures count as a Medium creature, and one Large creature counts as two Medium creatures). Pavilion tents are large enough to accommodate a small fire in the center. Packing up a tent takes half as long as assembling it.

Thurible

**Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 3 lbs.

When filled with coal and common herbs worth 2 sp, this miniature brazier fills an area 30 feet in diameter with light smoke for 1 hour. Any creature in the area of this smoke gains a +2 circumstance bonus on Fortitude saves to resist inhaled diseases.

torch

**Price** 1 cp; **Weight** 1 lb.

A torch burns for 1 hour, shedding normal light in a 20-foot radius and increasing the light level by one step for an additional 20 feet beyond that area (darkness becomes dim light and dim light becomes normal light). A torch does not increase the light level in normal light or bright light. If a torch is used in combat, treat it as a one-handed improvised weapon that deals bludgeoning damage equal to that of a gauntlet of its size, plus 1 point of fire damage.

Traveler's Dictionary

**Price** 50 gp; **Weight** 2 lbs.

Each of these books references a specific language and has two sections. The first presents a wide variety of useful phrases and words in Common (arranged by category) followed by a phonetic representation of the same in the language that the book deals with. The second section provides an alphabetical (by phonetic spelling) collection of words and phrases in the second language and their approximate Common translation. Using this book does not grant a bonus on rolls to communicate, but at the GM's discretion it can negate or reduce a penalty if the other creature is patient enough to wait for the translation.

waffle Iron

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 1 gp | 5 lbs. |
| Mithral | 1,001 gp | 2-1/2 lbs. |

This pair of hinged metal plates is decorated with studs to add texture to the pastry cakes you cook with it. You pour batter on it, close it, and place it on a fire or stove to cook. Some waffle irons have plates that imprint the waffle with a noble's coat of arms, a religious symbol, or a country's flag. A mithral waffle iron almost always bears a specific insignia rather than the generic waffle pattern. As with other mithral cookware, food rarely sticks to a mithral waffle iron.

water clock

**Price** 1,000 gp; **Weight** 200 lbs.

This large, bulky contrivance gives the time accurately to within half an hour per day since it was last set. It requires a source of water, and it must be kept still because it marks time by the regulated flow of droplets of water.

waterproof bag

**Price** 5 sp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This leather sack sealed with tar or pitch keeps delicate items from being ruined by water. Items kept inside remain relatively dry, making the bag ideal for carrying maps, scrolls, spellbooks, and the like, although the bag is not impervious and can only be completely immersed for 10 rounds before enough water seeps in to ruin such items.

Waterproof Lantern

**Price** +5 gp; **Weight** —

Meant to shelter its flame from both water and wind, this lantern treats severe winds as strong winds, windstorms as severe winds, and hurricanes as windstorms for the purpose of determining whether they extinguish its flame. It holds enough air to burn underwater for 5 rounds before going dark.

waterskin

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This bag is made of an animal bladder or treated leather. It is watertight and holds about 1/2 gallon of liquid. The listed weight is for a waterskin full of water; empty, it weighs about 2 pounds.

Wax Key Blank

**Price** 15 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This two-sided case contains a soft wax that readily takes and keeps an impression of an object pressed between the two halves, creating an excellent mold of the item. A skilled artisan may then make a copy of the item from the mold (destroying the mold in the process). Making an impression surreptitiously requires a DC 25 [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) check.

Weapon Cord

**Price** 1 sp; **Weight** —

Weapon cords are 2-foot-long leather straps that attach your weapon to your wrist. If you drop your weapon or are disarmed, you can recover it as a swift action, and it never moves any farther away from you than an adjacent square. However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 0 hit points). Unlike with a locked gauntlet, you can still use a hand with a weapon cord, though a dangling weapon may interfere with finer actions.

whetstone

**Price** 2 cp; **Weight** 1 lb.

A whetstone allows you to sharpen a blade by sliding it against the stone at a precise angle. Honing a blade with a whetstone requires about 15 minutes of work and grants the weapon a +1 bonus on your damage roll the first time you hit with it. This only works on nonmagical blades.

Wire

**Price** 5 gp; **Weight** 1/2 lb.

This 6-foot length of copper wire is strong and flexible. By attaching it to two pitons or iron spikes across an area, you can create a simple tripwire trap.

Tripwire Trap CR 1/3

**Type** mechanical; **[Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception)** DC 15; **[Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device)** DC 10

Effects

**Trigger** location; **Reset** automatic

**Effect** trip combat maneuver +5 (+10 if the target is running)

Wire Saw

| Type | Price | Weight |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Common | 30 gp | — |
| Adamantine | 150 gp | — |

This flexible saw consists of an abrasive wire hooked to two metal rings. By feeding the wire around a deadbolt or small door bar, you can use the rings to quietly saw through the obstruction. The saw takes 10 minutes to cut through a 2-inch piece of wood or a 1-inch iron bar. A wire saw can cut through items with hardness 10 or less. After five uses, the abrasive wire is worn smooth and must be replaced (costing 25 gp).

_Adamantine Wire Saw_: This works twice as fast as a normal saw when cutting materials with hardness 10 or less, or at normal speed when cutting materials with hardness 11–20. Replacing an adamantine wire saw's wire costs 145 gp.

Witch's kit

**Price** 21 gp; **Weight** 21 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, candles (10), chalk (10), a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, a spell component pouch, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin.

Wizard's kit

**Price** 21 gp; **Weight** 21 lbs.

This kit includes a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, a spell component pouch, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a spellbook because a wizard begins play with a spellbook and does not need to purchase one.

wrist sheath

**Price** 1 gp; **Weight** 1 lb.

This is a sheath designed to be strapped to your forearm and hidden under a long sleeve. The sheath can hold one forearm-length item, such as a dagger, dart, or wand, or up to five arrows or crossbow bolts. As a move action, you can bend your wrist to cause some or all of these items to drop into your hand (provoking attacks of opportunity as normal). You have a +2 bonus on [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks made to oppose the [Perception](skills/perception.md#_perception) check of someone observing or frisking you to determine items in the sheath. You can only wear one wrist sheath per arm.
