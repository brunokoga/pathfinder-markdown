# Gear

There’s more to adventuring than just weapons and armor, and this section breaks down the rest of the necessities. First comes the adventuring gear—a smorgasbord of mundane items used every day by adventurers of all stripes. Whether it’s simple things like a backpack or crowbar, or more esoteric items like a scabbard with hidden compartments or fake shoes for laying down false footprints; everything you need to stock your pack, baggage train, or general store. After this comes specialized gear, including tools and kits to help you with all manner of skills and professions. This is followed by mounts and transportation, ranging from carriages to barding for your riding bat.

Next comes the clothing section, which in addition to keeping your character from running naked into battle contains useful items such as skis, masks, and wigs. Entertainment items offers such things are marked cards and loaded dice, and trade goods details the livestock, foodstuffs, and other items you can sell to pay off any resulting gambling debts. The food and drink section and the lodging and services section present viands to feast on and places to stay when you return from your adventures, as well as rates for folks like doctors and lawyers.

After that, things get more exotic. Alchemical remedies offer more than just antitoxins—who wants to go adventuring without troll oil or vermin repellent? Alchemical tools range from glues and solvents to defoliants, smoke pellets, and glowing ink. Alchemical weapons include bottled lightning, fireworks, grenades, and more.
