# Specific Magic Armor

The magic armor that intrepid heroes don in the face of danger is often the only thing that stands between a brave adventurer and a blade to the chest. The following section includes armors with unusual powers and magical abilities. Magic armors may have abilities that need to be activated to function or powers that work passively and constantly.

Adamatine Breastplate

**Price** 10,200 gp; **Aura** no aura (nonmagical); **CL** —; **Weight** 30 lbs.

This nonmagical breastplate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction 2/—.

Armor Of Insults

**Price** 16,175 gp; **Aura** moderate enchantment; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 20 lbs.

Each metal bit of this suit of _+1 studded leather_ looks more like a tiny sneering face than a simple stud. Once per day the wearer of the armor may command the mouths to unleash a torrent of verbal abuse directed against every hostile creature within 60 feet who can see and hear the wearer. Each such creature must make a DC 16 Will saving throw to avoid suffering an overwhelming compulsion to attack the wearer for the next 7 rounds. If the creature is unable to attack the wearer on its next turn, or attacking the wearer would put the creature at risk (moving through a threatened square, charging into a pit, and so on) it can act normally that turn. This is a mind-affecting sonic effect, and has no effect on creatures that do not use a spoken language.

**Cost** 7,675 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [confusion](spells/confusion.md#_confusion)_

Banded Mail of Luck

**Price** 18,900 gp; **Aura** strong enchantment; **CL** 12th; **Weight** 35 lbs.

Ten 100-gp gems adorn this _+3 banded mail_. Once per week, the armor allows its wearer to require that an attack roll made against him be rerolled. He must take whatever consequences come from the second roll. The wearer's player must decide whether to have the attack roll rerolled before damage is rolled.

**Cost** 9,650 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [bless](spells/bless.md#_bless)_

Boneless Leather

**Price** 12,160 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This suit of _+1 leather_ gives its wearer the ability to twist and contort her body in virtually any direction. She gains a +5 bonus on [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) checks, a +5 bonus on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks to reduce damage from falls, a +5 bonus to CMD, and DR 5/piercing or slashing.

Breastplate of Command

**Price** 25,400 gp; **Aura** strong enchantment; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 30 lbs.

This _+2 breastplate_ typically bears the image of a rampant grizzly bear or other impressive predator. It bestows a commanding aura upon its wearer. The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on all Charisma checks, including Charisma-based skill checks. The wearer also gains a +2 competence bonus to his [Leadership](feats.md#_leadership) score. Friendly troops within 360 feet of the user become braver than normal, gaining a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against fear. Since the effect arises in great part from the distinctiveness of the armor, it does not function if the wearer hides or conceals herself in any way.

Breastplate of Vanishing

**Price** 15,200 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This battered _+1 mithral breastplate_ bears a resemblance to a stylized turtle shell. On command, its wearer can vanish inside the armor, leaving the breastplate behind while she stays safely hidden in an extradimensional space. This space is barely large enough for the wearer to sit comfortably, but does provides breathable air and light to see by. The wearer cannot perceive the environs around the armor while inside. A second command word returns the wearer to the armor's location, wearing the armor. If the wearer can't return to the space the armor is in, she is instead shunted to the nearest empty space that can contain her, but no longer wearing the armor.

If the breastplate is destroyed, the wearer immediately returns to the square the armor was in when it was destroyed. Successfully dispelling the armor likewise returns the wearer, though in this case still wearing the armor.

buccaneer's breastplate

**Price** 23,850 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 30 lbs.

This _+1 breastplate_ is made of shining amber metal and decorated with faint motifs of the waves and water.

If a creature puts on the armor while underwater, the wearer is borne toward the surface at a rate of 60 feet per round.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 12,100 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [water walk](spells/waterWalk.md#_water-walk)_

Catskin Leather

**Price** 18,910 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

Rather than the hide of a cat, this extremely supple suit of jet-black _+1 [shadow](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_shadow) leather armor_ grants a portion of the grace and fortune of a feline. It has no armor check penalty or maximum Dexterity bonus. The wearer receives a +5 competence bonus on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks and takes only half normal damage from falling. When the wearer's hit points would be reduced to a negative amount equal to her Constitution score from an attack or spell, the armor falls to pieces and is destroyed, and the wearer takes only half damage from the attack or spell.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 9,535 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [cat's grace](spells/catSGrace.md#_cat-s-grace)_, _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_, and _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish)_, _ [wish](spells/wish.md#_wish),_ or _ [miracle](spells/miracle.md#_miracle)_

Celestial Armor

**Price** 22,400 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation [good]; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 20 lbs.

This _+3 chainmail_ is so fine and light that it can be worn under normal clothing without betraying its presence. It has a maximum Dexterity bonus of +8, an armor check penalty of –2, and an arcane spell failure chance of 15%. It is considered light armor and allows the wearer to use _ [fly](spells/fly.md)_ on command (as the spell) once per day.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 11,350 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [fly](spells/fly.md)_, creator must be good

Daystar Half-Plate

**Price** 81,250 gp; **Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This glowing _+1 half-plate_ is decorated with various images of the sun and depictions of nature. At will, the wearer can command the armor to shine with a _ [daylight](spells/daylight.md#_daylight)_ spell for 10 minutes. Once per day, the wearer can command it to shine as per the _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst)_ spell. The _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst)_ is centered on the wearer and the wearer is immune to its effects.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 41,000 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [daylight](spells/daylight.md#_daylight)_, _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst)_

Demon Armor

**Price** 52,260 gp; **Aura** strong necromancy [evil]; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. Glowing red energy emanates from sigils engraved on the armor's key plates and joints, and the runes intermittently surge with fiendish power. This _+4 full plate_ allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a _ [contagion](spells/contagion.md#_contagion)_ spell (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of _ [contagion](spells/contagion.md#_contagion)_ requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The "claws" are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.

A suit of _demon armor_ is infused with evil, and as a result it bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and disappears when the armor is removed. The negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _ [restoration](spells/restoration.md#_restoration)_ spells) while the armor is worn.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 26,955 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [contagion](spells/contagion.md#_contagion)_

Dragonhide Plate

**Price** 3,300 gp; **Aura** no aura (nonmagical); **CL** —; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This suit of full plate is made of dragonhide, rather than metal, so druids can wear it. It is otherwise identical to masterwork full plate.

The wearer of dragonhide plate tends to draw the ire of dragons of the same type as that used in the armor's creation.

Dwarven Plate

**Price** 16,500 gp; **Aura** no aura (nonmagical); **CL** —; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This full plate is made of adamantine, giving its wearer damage reduction 3/—.

Elven Chain

**Price** 5,150 gp; **Aura** no aura (nonmagical); **CL** —; **Weight** 20 lbs.

This extremely light chainmail is made of very fine mithral links. This armor is treated, in all ways, like light armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 20%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +4, and an armor check penalty of –2.

Enchanted Eelskin

**Price** 11,160 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This _+1 [slick](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_slick) leather armor _is made of shining, slippery eelskin that allows the wearer to move with deadly grace and sudden swiftness, especially underwater. When immersed in water, _enchanted eelskin _gains the _ [shadow](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_shadow) _property and grants the wearer a swim speed of 30 feet and the ability to breathe water. In addition, during a surprise round the wearer can act as if she had a full round of actions, rather than a single standard action, as long as those actions do not require leaving the water. If she does leave the water, her surprise round turn immediately ends.

**Cost** 5,660 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor,_ [grease](spells/grease.md#_grease)_,_ [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_, _ [touch of the sea](advanced/spells/touchOfTheSea.md#_touch-of-the-sea) _

Equestrian Plate

**Price** 10,650 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** Varies

**Full Plate** 50lbs.; **Banded mail** 35 lbs.; **Barding** 70 lbs.

Shined to a mirror finish, this suit of _+2 full plate_ is decorated with gold inlay. As a move action when the wearer is mounted, the plates of the armor expand and reposition to protect the wearer's mount. In this form, the armor becomes a suit of _+2 banded mail_ for the wearer and a suit of _+1 banded mail barding_ worn by the mount. A second move action merges it back into _+2 full plate_. _Equestrian plate_ cannot transform and protect a mount more than one size larger than its wearer or a creature that cannot wear barding. It can create exotic barding, however, such as for a griffon or dragon.

If extra enhancements or spells are placed upon _equestrian plate_ in full plate form, they affect only the wearer's armor when the suit is split. Effects on the barding are suppressed when it is merged into the armor. If either suit of armor is broken while separated, the other half immediately gains the broken condition as well. Destroying one suit destroys the other as well.

**Cost** 6,150 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [fabricate](spells/fabricate.md#_fabricate)_

Folding Plate

**Price** 12,650 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This item normally looks like a heavy steel brooch or cloak clasp, often depicting a heavy helm or sturdy shield. On command, the brooch transforms in a clatter of metallic plates and panels to instantly cover the wearer in a complete suit of _+1 full plate_, with the design of the brooch displayed on the armor's breastplate. The same command word causes the armor to transform into the brooch. The brooch only transforms if the wearer's armor slot is unoccupied, thus it won't work if the wearer is already armored. The brooch associated with this armor weighs less than a pound and occupies the neck slot when in this form.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 7,650 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [instant summons](spells/instantSummons.md#_instant-summons)_

Forsaken Banded Mail

**Price** 25,400 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** 35 lbs.

A massive skull adorns the chest piece of this suit of _+1 banded mail_, and smaller gilted images of defaced holy symbols cover the other parts of the armor. The wearer of the armor cannot cast divine spells or use any spell-like supernatural ability gained from a connection to a deity. The wearer gains SR 19 against any divine-origin spell, spell-like ability, or supernatural ability (such as a domain granted power or ability from an outsider serving a deity), and treats the armor's enhancement bonus as +2 higher against creatures with these abilities.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 12,900 gp

Giant-Hide Armor

**Price** Varies; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 25lbs.

**Ogre** 39,165 gp; **Hill Giant** 46,665 gp; **Stone, fire, or frost giant** 54,165 gp; **Troll** 59,165 gp; **Cloud giant** 69,165 gp; **Storm giant** 76,665 gp

This drooping, many-folded suit of _+3 hide armor_ is made from the tanned skin of an actual giant. Once per day on command, the wearer can grow to match the size of the appropriate giant, as if using _ [giant form I](spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-i)_ (ogre, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, frost giant, or troll) or _ [giant form II](spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-ii)_ (cloud giant or storm giant). This transformation lasts up to 15 minutes, and ends when the wearer commands.

Most good folk consider wearing the skins of intelligent creatures to be abhorrent. Giants gain a +2 morale bonus on attack and damage rolls against the wearer, or +4 if the wearer's armor is made from the same kind of giant as the attacker.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** varies

**Ogre** 19,660 gp; **Hill Giant** 23,415 gp; **Stone, fire, or frost giant** 27,165 gp; **Troll** 29,665 gp; **Cloud giant** 34,665 gp; **Storm giant** 38,415 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [giant form I](spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-i)_ (ogre, hill giant, stone giant, fire giant, frost giant, or troll) or _ [giant form II](spells/giantForm.md#_giant-form-ii)_ (cloud giant or storm giant)

Hamatula Hide

**Price** 44,215 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 12 lbs.

Crafted from the flayed skin of a barbed devil, this imposing _+2 spiked hide armor_ weighs half the normal weight. When its wearer rages, the armor's spikes elongate and the hide bonds to her skin, providing fire resistance 10. Any creature that strikes the wearer with a melee weapon, unarmed strike, or a natural weapon while the spikes are elongated takes 1d8+6 points of piercing damage from the armor's barbs (unless using a weapon with reach). While the wearer is enraged, spells that cause additional damage to evil outsiders deal that increased damage to her.

A barbarian with fiend totem rage powers gains additional benefits from _hamatula hide_. If she has the lesser fiend totem rage power, she gains a +1 profane bonus to Armor Class while raging. If she has the fiend totem rage power, the damage caused by her barbs increases to 2d8+6 and stacks with the barbed defense granted by the armor. If she has the greater fiend totem ability, she gains fire resistance 20 when raging.

Invincible Armor

**Price** 137,650 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 50 lbs.

_Invincible armor_ shifts between three different appearances, but always weighs the same and protects as _+2 impervious moderate fortification full plate_. As an immediate action, the wearer can change the armor into heavy plate that blocks slashing attacks (DR 10/bludgeoning or piercing), thickly layered chainmail that blocks piercing attacks (DR 10/bludgeoning or slashing), or overlapping metal scales that block bludgeoning attacks (DR 10/piercing or slashing). In addition, _invincible armor_ provides the wearer with 5 points of resistance to acid, cold, electricity, fire, and sonic, and is itself unharmed by damage from any of these energy types.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** 69,650 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [fabricate](spells/fabricate.md#_fabricate)_, _ [make whole](spells/makeWhole.md#_make-whole)_, _ [resist energy](spells/resistEnergy.md#_resist-energy)_, and _ [limited wish](spells/limitedWish.md#_limited-wish) _or _ [miracle](spells/miracle.md#_miracle)_

Mail of Malevolence

**Price** 61,300 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 40 lbs.

_Mail of malevolence_ hangs in rags and tatters and acts as nonmagical chainmail to wearers who lack at least a moderate evil aura (_Core Rulebook_ 266). When worn by a sufficiently evil character, it instead functions as _+2 [unrighteous](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_unrighteous) chainmail_. _Mail of malevolence_ does not bestow a negative level on good wearers.

The wearer of _mail of malevolence_ gains SR 21, but only against spells with the good descriptor. In addition, whenever the wearer channels negative energy to harm living creatures, she heals a like amount of damage herself regardless of whether she is living or undead.

**Cost** 30,800 gp

Mistmail

**Price** 2,250 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 25 lbs.

The fine links of this _+1 chain shirt_ form a pattern of roiling clouds. On command once per day, the wearer can transform it into thick fog that fills his space and provides concealment (20% miss chance). This mist moves with the character. Effects that disperse the mist or destroy it cause the armor to reform into its solid shape on the character's body, as does speaking the command word or entering a place where the fog-magic doesn't function (such as underwater). If the character tries to don another suit of armor while the _mistmail_ is in fog form, it reforms at the character's feet.

**Cost** 1,250 gp

Mithral full plate of speed

**Price** 26,500 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 25 lbs.

As a free action, the wearer of this fine set of _+1 mithral full plate_ can activate it, enabling him to act as though affected by a _ [haste](spells/haste.md#_haste)_ spell for up to 10 rounds each day. The duration of the _ [haste](spells/haste.md#_haste)_ effect need not be consecutive rounds. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +3, and an armor check penalty of –3. It is considered medium armor, except that you must be proficient in heavy armor to avoid taking nonproficiency penalties.

**Cost** 18,500 gp

Mithral Shirt

**Price** 1,100 gp; **Aura** no aura (nonmagical); **CL** —; **Weight** 10 lbs.

This extremely light chain shirt is made of very fine mithral links. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 10%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +6, and no armor check penalty. It is considered light armor.

Morlock Hide

**Price** 8,910 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion and transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This _+1 [shadow](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_shadow) leather armor _causes the wearer's skin to warp and distort into a welter of horrid scarification. The armor itself disappears from view under this coat of scars and the wearer's face appears as a loathsome, eyeless veil of flesh. This change is illusory, similar to _ [glamered](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_glamered) _armor; however, _morlock hide _does cause the wearer's arms and legs to extend and her posture to become hunched. She gains a +2 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics), [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb), and [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) checks, and she can move through narrow spaces while squeezing at normal speed and with no penalty to AC or on attack rolls.

This silk _+1 [shadow](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_shadow) padded armor_ is as dark as night and stitched with thread the color of dried blood. When worn by a rogue with the bleed talent, it increases the bleed damage of the rogue's sneak attacks by +1.

Otyugh Hide

**Price** 2,565 gp; **Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 25 lbs.

This muddy brown _+1 hide armor _carries a fetid stench like raw sewage, and occasionally sprouts angry and uncomfortable-looking blisters. Creatures other than the wearer are repulsed by the _otyugh armor's _vile putridity.

Any creature ending its turn adjacent to the wearer becomes sickened (Fortitude DC 13 negates) for as long as it remains adjacent to the wearer and for 1 round thereafter. A creature that strikes the wearer with a bite attack is affected the same way, even if it possesses exceptional reach and attacks while not adjacent to the wearer. If the wearer is swallowed whole, the attacker is automatically sickened and must succeed at a DC 13 Fortitude save at the beginning of its turn or be forced to regurgitate and drop the wearer harmlessly in an adjacent square (though the wearer is knocked prone during the regurgitation). Creatures with the scent ability suffer a –2 penalty to their saving throw against the stench of the _otyugh armor_. These abilities are poison effects; creatures immune to poison are immune to these effects as well. The wearer is immune to this effect.

The wearer gains a +2 competence bonus on saves against disease, poison, and any effect that would cause her to become nauseated or sickened.

This _+1 full plate_ is decorated with a wave and fish motif and often has tiny fins and scales worked into the design. Although the armor remains as heavy and bulky as normal full plate, the wearer of _plate armor of the deep_ is treated as unarmored for purposes of [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) checks. The wearer can breathe underwater and can converse with any water-breathing creature with a language.

**Price** 160,650 gp; **Aura** strong abjuration; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 50 lbs.

This resplendent suit of _+3 full plate_ shimmers and shifts between all the colors of the rainbow. A single color dominates the others at any given time. As a swift action, the wearer can change the dominant color. This color remains dominant until the wearer changes it again. When the wearer of _prismatic plate_ is struck by a _ [prismatic spray](spells/prismaticSpray.md#_prismatic-spray),_ or when he passes through a _ [prismatic sphere](spells/prismaticSphere.md#_prismatic-sphere)_ or _ [prismatic wall](spells/prismaticWall.md#_prismatic-wall)_, he ignores the effect that matches the dominant armor color. He receives no special protection against the other colors of those spells. In addition to this benefit, each color provides a unique type of protection.

Rhino Hide

**Price** 5,165 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 25 lbs.

This _+2 hide armor_ is made from rhinoceros hide. In addition to granting a +2 enhancement bonus to AC, it has a –1 armor check penalty and deals an additional 2d6 points of damage on any successful charge attack made by the wearer, including a mounted charge.

Scarab Breastplate

**Price** 32,350 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** 30 lbs.

This _+3 breastplate _is crafted from the carapace of a giant scarab beetle, enchanted to be as hard and reflective as polished steel. The wearer suffers only half damage from vermin swarms and gains a +2 resistance bonus on saving throws against the extraordinary abilities of vermin swarms.

In addition, once per day on command, the wearer can transform the _scarab breastplate _into a swarm of scarab beetles that skitter from her chest to attack creatures nearby. This swarm has statistics identical to an army ant swarm and attacks any creatures within its space. The wearer can command the swarm to move (including changing the shape of the swarm) as a move action, but the swarm must remain adjacent to her. If the swarm is reduced to 0 hit points, if the wearer is forced to move away from the swarm, or if the wearer commands it to return to her as a move action, the swarm crawls back onto the wearer's torso and returns to armor form. While the swarm is active, the wearer is not considered to be wearing the _scarab breastplate_ (except for purposes of commanding the swarm) and gains no defensive benefits from it.

A druid of 6th level wearing a _scarab breastplate _can use her wild shape ability to duplicate _ [vermin shape I](ultimateMagic/spells/verminShape.md#_vermin-shape-i-)_. At 8th level, she can also use it to duplicate _ [vermin shape II](ultimateMagic/spells/verminShape.md#_vermin-shape-ii)_.

Soothsayer's Raiment

**Price** 10,300 gp; **Aura** faint divination; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 40 lbs.

This _+1 chainmail_ is attuned to a particular oracular mystery and contains a revelation associated with that mystery (see the oracle class description in the _Advanced Player's Guide_). Its design and coloration are typically suggestive of its related mystery. While wearing the armor, an oracle has access to that revelation and may use it as if she had it as a normal class feature. The oracle must have the appropriate mystery to use the armor; for example, a _soothsayer's raiment (battlecry)_ is only usable by an oracle of battle. If the wearer already has that revelation and the revelation grants an ability with a limited number of uses per day, the oracle can use that ability one additional time per day. This ability has no effect if the armor is worn by a non-oracle.

For divination spells with a percentage-based chance of success (such as _ [augury](spells/augury.md#_augury)_ and _ [divination](spells/divination.md#_divination)_), the wearer's chance increases by +5.

Warden of the Woods

**Price** 29,350 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 11th; **Weight** 25 lbs.

The _warden of the woods_ is a suit of _+3 greenwood splint mail_ made of strips of laminated greenwood that flex with the wearer's movement but stiffen when struck in battle. This armor is treated in all ways like medium armor, including when determining proficiency. The armor has an arcane spell failure chance of 25%, a maximum Dexterity bonus of +2, and an armor check penalty of –4.

As a move action, the wearer can snap a strip of wood loose from the armor. The strip lengthens into a weapon of a type chosen by the armor's wearer. It can become a _+1 greenwood club_, a _+1/+1 greenwood quarterstaff_, or a _+1 [keen](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-keen) greenwood wooden stake_. If the wearer creates a club or quarterstaff in this way, it gains the benefits of the _ [shillelagh](spells/shillelagh.md#_shillelagh)_ spell with a duration of 1 minute. Each weapon removed from the _warden of the woods_ reduces the armor's enhancement bonus by 1. Consequently, a maximum of three such weapons can be separated from the armor at any given time. The greenwood weapons keep their enhancement bonuses only while they're in the wearer's hands, though they remain masterwork weapons for other wielders.

The wearer can reintegrate a weapon back into the _warden of the woods_ as a move action and restore the lost enhancement bonus. Each day at dawn, the armor regenerates any missing strips (regaining its full enhancement bonus), and any weapons still detached from the armor crumble into dust.

Absorbing Shield

**Price** 50,170 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 17th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This _+1 heavy steel shield_ is made of metal, but its color is a flat black that seems to absorb light. Once every 2 days, on command, it can disintegrate an object that it touches, as the spell but requiring a melee touch attack. This effect only functions as an attack—it can't be activated to target a creature or weapon as it strikes the shield.

The front of this _+1 [bashing](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_bashing) heavy steel shield_ looks as though it is crafted from hundreds of bits of rubble and larger stones. When used to make a shield bash attack, stones fall from shield and cling to the target of the shield bash. The target must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude saving throw or be entangled for 1d4 rounds. Once per day on command, the target's wielder can choose to petrify the target of a shield bash instead. The target must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude saving throw or become petrified for 1 minute.

Battlement Shield

**Price** 16,180 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 45 lbs.

Once per day on command, this _+2 tower shield_ can transform into a solid, 1-foot-thick, 10-foot-by-10-foot wall of masonry with a battlement on top and an arrow slit in each 5-foot length. The wall acts as cover just like any physical wall. The wielder can touch the wall with one hand and command it to revert to a tower shield either resting on the ground and balanced against his hand or strapped to his arm in the normal fashion. The wall has all the characteristics of any other foot-thick wall of masonry (hardness 8, 90 hit points, break DC 35). Attacks sufficient to destroy the wall cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. The shield remains in wall form until destroyed or commanded to return to shield form. The wall cannot appear in a space too small to accommodate it.

This _+1 [animated](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_animated) [bashing](ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/armorSpecialAbilities.md#_bashing) heavy steel shield_ rattles in anticipation during battle. When loosed into the air to defend its wearer, the _belligerent shield _attacks as well as defends. Each round starting the round after animation, the shield makes a single shield bash attack against a foe of its wearer's choice within the wearer's reach. This works as a standard shield bash attack using the wearer's normal attack bonus with the shield, except that the wearer retains the shield bonus to AC, and while the shield's attack is treated as an off-hand attack, the wearer does not take off-hand penalties on her own attacks unless she is fighting with two weapons herself. If the wearer has any feats or abilities that benefit shield bashing attacks, they apply to attacks made by the _belligerent shield_.

**Price** 4,655 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This unassuming +1 buckler has an array of small tools and implements embedded into the backside of its rim, able to be folded and snapped out for use at a moment's notice to attack, defend, or accomplish roguish tasks. A burglar's buckler grants the wielder a +2 competence bonus on [Disable Device](skills/disableDevice.md#_disable-device) and [Sleight of Hand](skills/sleightOfHand.md#_sleight-of-hand) checks, combat maneuver checks made to perform dirty tricks, and to CMD against dirty tricks.

Once per day on command, the wielder may transform a _burglar's buckler _into any mundane tool weighing 1 to 5 pounds, such as a crowbar, hammer, saw, small shovel, grappling hook, artisan's tools, or thieves' tools. The _burglar's buckler _retains its normal hardness and hit points in this form and can be converted back into shield form on command.

This _+1 light wooden shield_ has a leather strip on the back on which a spellcaster can scribe a single spell as on a scroll. A spell so scribed requires half the normal cost in raw materials. The strip cannot accommodate spells of higher than 3rd level. The strip is reusable.

A random caster's shield has a 50% chance of having a single medium scroll spell on it. The spell is divine (01–80 on d%) or arcane (81–100). A caster's shield has a 5% arcane spell failure chance. The price of the shield is modified by the value of the scroll spell if one is currently scribed.

It has no armor check penalty or arcane spell failure chance, and it allows the wielder to use _ [feather fall](spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_ on himself once per day.

The wearer of this _+1 tower shield_ may, as a full-round action, transform the shield into a 1-inch-thick cube of iron that springs into being around him, completely enclosing his space. The cube has hardness 10 and 30 hit points per side. This cube grants the wearer total cover against everything outside the cube, including (as it is perfectly sealed) swarms and gas attacks. The inside of the cube is dark, and air cannot get in or out so the wearer must hold his breath starting on the third round after activating the cube. Attacks sufficient to destroy one side of the cube cause it to immediately transform back into a shield, which loses half its hit points and gains the broken condition. Otherwise, the cube reverts to shield form upon command, if the wearer moves from his current space, or if the wearer falls unconscious or dies.

This nonmagical heavy steel shield is made out of living steel. It has no enhancement bonus, but its material and construction can damage metal weapons that strike it. Whenever the wielder of a metal weapon (other than one made of adamantine) rolls a natural 1 on an attack against a creature wielding this shield, the item must make a DC 20 Fortitude save or gain the broken condition. If the weapon already has the broken condition, it is instead destroyed.

On command, the wielder can make the shield produce a gallon of fresh drinkable water. Once per day on command, the wielder can use the _maelstrom shield _to emit a stream of water as the _ [hydraulic push](advanced/spells/hydraulicPush.md#_hydraulic-push-)_ spell.

Zombie Skin Shield

**Price** 2,159 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 15 lbs.

This _+1 light steel shield_ is wrapped in a layer of gray skin. Once per day, the wearer can animate the skin as a human zombie under her control, as if she had created it with _ [animate dead](spells/animateDead.md#_animate-dead)_, for a period of 5 minutes. When the time expires, the zombie returns to the shield. If the zombie is destroyed or cannot reach the shield by the time it expires, placing the shield on a Medium humanoid corpse for 1 hour recreates the shield's skin.
