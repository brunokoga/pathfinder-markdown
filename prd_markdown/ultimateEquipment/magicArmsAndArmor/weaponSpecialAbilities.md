# Weapon Special Abilities

A magic weapon is enhanced to strike more truly and deliver more damage. Magic weapons have enhancement bonuses ranging from +1 to +5. They apply these bonuses to both attack and damage rolls when used in combat. All magic weapons are also masterwork weapons, but their masterwork bonuses on attack rolls do not stack with their enhancement bonuses on attack rolls.

Weapons come in two basic categories: melee and ranged. Some of the weapons listed as melee weapons can also be used as ranged weapons. In this case, their enhancement bonuses apply to both melee and ranged attacks.

Some magic weapons have special abilities. Special abilities count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of the item, but do not modify attack or damage bonuses (except where specifically noted). A single weapon cannot have a modified bonus (enhancement bonus plus special ability bonus equivalents, including from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus. Weapons cannot possess the same special ability more than once.

Weapons or ammunition can be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

**Caster Level for Weapons** : The caster level of a weapon with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus and no other abilities, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

**Additional Damage Dice** : Some magic weapons deal additional dice of damage. Unlike other modifiers to damage, additional dice of damage are not multiplied when the attacker scores a critical hit.

**Ranged Weapons and Ammunition** : The enhancement bonus from a ranged weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus from ammunition. Only the higher of the two enhancement bonuses applies.

Ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an enhancement bonus of +1 or higher is treated as a magic weapon for the purpose of overcoming damage reduction. Similarly, ammunition fired from a projectile weapon with an alignment gains the alignment of that projectile weapon.

**Light Generation** : Fully 30% of magic weapons shed light equivalent to a light spell. These glowing weapons are quite obviously magical. They can't be concealed when drawn, nor can their light be shut off. Some of the specific weapons detailed below always or never glow, as defined in their descriptions.

**Hardness and Hit Points** : Each +1 of a magic weapon's enhancement bonus adds +2 to its hardness and +10 to its hit points.

**Activation** : Usually a character benefits from a magic weapon in the same way a character benefits from a mundane weapon—by wielding (attacking with) it. If a weapon has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter a command word (a standard action). A character can activate the special abilities of 50 pieces of ammunition at the same time, assuming each piece has identical abilities.

**Magic Weapons and Critical Hits** : Some weapon qualities and some specific weapons have an extra effect on a critical hit. This special effect also functions against creatures not normally subject to critical hits. On a successful critical roll, apply the special effect, but do not multiply the weapon's regular damage.

**Weapons for Unusually Sized Creatures** : The cost of weapons for creatures that are neither Small nor Medium varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

**Special Qualities** : Roll d%. A 01–30 result indicates that the item sheds light, 31–45 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to the weapon's function, and 46–100 indicates no special qualities.

# Magic Weapon Special Ability Descriptions

A weapon with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Adaptive

**Price** +1,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 1st; **Weight** —

This ability can only be placed on composite bows. An _adaptive_ bow responds to the strength of its wielder, acting as a bow with a strength rating equal to its wielder's Strength bonus. The wielder can fire it with a lesser Strength bonus (and cause less damage) if desired.

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [warp wood](spells/warpWood#_warp-wood)_

Advancing

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This ability can only be placed on melee weapons. Once per round, when the wielder damages a creature in melee with an _advancing _weapon, she can take a 5-foot step as a swift action after the attack but before the end of her turn. This movement does not count against her ability to move or take a 5-foot step earlier or later in the round, though using this ability imposes a –2 penalty on all attack rolls until the start of her next turn. This ability may not be used in conjunction with any other ability or effect that allows moving as part of an attack.

Allying

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

An _allying _weapon allows the wielder to transfer some or all of the weapon's enhancement bonus to one weapon being used by an ally of the wielder. The wielder must have line of sight to the intended ally. As a free action, at the start of her turn before using her weapon, the wielder chooses how to allocate her weapon's enhancement bonus. The bonus to the ally's weapon lasts until the _allying _weapon's wielder's next turn. The enhancement bonus from the _allying _weapon does not stack with the enhancement bonus on the ally's weapon (if any).

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [magic weapon](spells/magicWeapon#_magic-weapon)_

Anarchic

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

An _anarchic_ weapon is infused with the power of chaos. It makes the weapon chaotically aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against all creatures of lawful alignment. It bestows one permanent negative level (_Core Rulebook_ 562) on any lawful creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _ [restoration](spells/restoration#_restoration)_ spells) while the weapon is wielded.

Anchoring

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This special ability can only be added to a melee weapon or a thrown weapon. An _anchoring _weapon pins a target in place and prevents it from moving. As a swift action, the weapon can be fixed in place in a point in space, functioning as an _ [immovable rod](magicItems/rods#_immovable-rod). _This ability can also be used when the wielder hits a creature with a melee attack using an _anchoring_ weapon. This anchors the target to the weapon, preventing it from moving away from the weapon. The target is not entangled or paralyzed; it simply cannot move from its location without first destroying the weapon or making a successful DC 30 Strength check as a full-round action to move with the weapon up to 10 feet. An _anchoring _weapon remains motionless and cannot be used to attack while it is anchoring a creature. An _anchoring _weapon has no effect on amorphous creatures, including elementals, oozes, and creatures in gaseous or liquid form. It also cannot anchor incorporeal creatures unless the weapon also has the _ghost touch _special ability.

Axiomatic

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

An _axiomatic_ weapon is infused with lawful power. It makes the weapon law-aligned and thus bypasses the corresponding damage reduction. It deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against chaotic creatures. It bestows one permanent negative level (_Core Rulebook_ 562) on any chaotic creature attempting to wield it. The negative level remains as long as the weapon is in hand and disappears when the weapon is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including _ [restoration](spells/restoration#_restoration)_ spells) while the weapon is wielded.

Bane

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

A _bane_ weapon excels against certain foes. Against a designated foe, the weapon's enhancement bonus is +2 better than its actual bonus. It also deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against such foes. To randomly determine a weapon's designated foe, roll on the following table.

| d% | Designated Foe |
| --- | --- |
| 01–05 | Aberrations |
| 06–09 | Animals |
| 10–16 | Constructs |
| 17–22 | Dragons |

Benevolent

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This ability can only be placed on a melee weapon. When the wielder of a benevolent weapon uses the aid another action to grant an ally a bonus on attack rolls, he increases the aid another bonus by the enhancement bonus of the weapon.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [aid](spells/aid#_aid)_

Brilliant Energy

**Price** +4 bonus; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 16th; **Weight** —

A _brilliant energy_ weapon has its significant portion transformed into light, although this does not modify the item's weight. It always gives off light as a torch (20-foot radius). A _brilliant energy_ weapon ignores nonliving matter. Armor and shield bonuses to AC (including any enhancement bonuses to that armor) do not count against it because the weapon passes through armor. (Dexterity, deflection, dodge, natural armor, and other such bonuses still apply.) A _brilliant energy_ weapon cannot harm undead, constructs, or objects.

Called

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

A _called _weapon can be teleported to the wielder's hand as a swift action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity, even if the weapon is in the possession of another creature. This ability has a maximum range of 100 feet, and effects that block teleportation prevent the return of a _called _weapon_._ A _called _weapon must be in a creature's possession for at least 24 hours for this ability to function.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [teleport](spells/teleport#_teleport)_

Conductive

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

A _conductive_ weapon is able to channel the energy of a spell-like or supernatural ability that relies on a melee or ranged touch attack to hit its target (such as from a cleric's domain granted power, sorcerer's bloodline power, oracle's mystery revelation, or wizard's arcane school power). When the wielder makes a successful attack of the appropriate type, he may choose to expend two uses of his magical ability to channel it through the weapon to the struck opponent, which suffers the effects of both the weapon attack and the special ability. (If the wielder has unlimited uses of a special ability, she may channel through the weapon every round.) For example, a paladin who strikes an undead opponent with her _conductive greatsword_ can expend two uses of her lay on hands ability (a supernatural melee touch attack) to deal both greatsword damage and damage from one use of lay on hands. This weapon special ability can only be used once per round, and only works with magical abilities of the same type as the weapon (melee or ranged).

Construction Requirements

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [spectral hand](spells/spectralHand#_spectral-hand)_

Conserving

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This ability cannot be placed on firearms. Only projectile weapons can be made _conserving_. When the wielder misses with a ranged attack, the fired ammunition teleports unharmed to its quiver, case, or pouch. If the ammunition in question would be destroyed for other reasons than merely being launched, such as an arrow that breaks apart in flight, this special ability does not function and the ammunition is destroyed as normal. Effects that block teleportation prevent this special ability from working.

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [abundant ammunition](ultimateCombat/spells/abundantAmmunition#_abundant-ammunition)_ (_Ultimate Combat_), _ [dimension door](spells/dimensionDoor#_dimension-door)_

Corrosive

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

Upon command, a _corrosive _weapon becomes slick with acid that deals an extra 1d6 points of acid damage on a successful hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. The effect remains until another command is given.

Construction Requirements

**Cost** +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [acid arrow](spells/acidArrow#_acid-arrow)_

Corrosive Burst

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

A _Corrosive burst_ weapon functions as a _corrosive_ weapon that explodes with searing acid upon striking a successful critical hit. The acid does not harm the wielder. In addition to the extra acid damage from the _corrosive_ special ability, a _Corrosive burst _weapon deals an extra 1d10 points of acid damage on a successful critical hit. If the weapon's critical modifier is ×3, add an extra 2d10 points of acid damage instead, and if the modifier is ×4, add an extra 3d10 points.

Even if the _corrosive_ ability is not active, the weapon still deals its extra acid damage on a successful critical hit.

**Cost** +2 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [acid arrow](spells/acidArrow#_acid-arrow)_

Countering

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

A _countering _weapon gives its wielder a +2 bonus to his combat maneuver defense against combat maneuvers made to disarm or sunder this weapon. If the attempt fails, the wielder can immediately attempt the same maneuver against the opponent without provoking attacks of opportunity. The wielder never risks dropping his weapon with a failed disarm combat maneuver when counterattacking in this manner.

This weapon special ability can only be applied to alchemical or metal firearm cartridges. _Dry load_ cartridges can be used to load guns underwater or in other airless environments, such as a vacuum. This special ability protects the cartridge's contents as it is being loaded into a firearm and creates a residual bubble of air that surrounds that firearm, further protecting the ammunition and allowing the firearm with this ammunition loaded in it to be fired in an airless environment. After the cartridge is loaded, the bubble of air lasts for 3 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever occurs first.

A firearm loaded with this ammunition still takes the –2 penalty on attack rolls when fired underwater for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range. When firing a _dry load_ cartridge underwater or in an airless environment, a misfire that results in a firearm explosion occurs normally.

This ability does not reduce the amount of time required to load or fire the weapon. The created arrow or bolt vanishes if removed from the weapon; it persists only if fired.

In addition, whenever the wielder receives temporary hit points from any source, he adds the weapon's enhancement bonus to these temporary hit points; this does not stack for temporary hit points from multiple sources, and these points are lost if the _lifesurge _weapon is not being wielded.

In combat, the weapon's critical threat range is doubled against undead; this does not stack with the _keen _special ability or [Improved Critical](feats#_improved-critical). Whenever a _lifesurge _weapon confirms a critical hit against an undead creature, it erupts with 1d8 points of positive energy (2d8 for weapons with a critical multiplier of ×3, 3d8 if it is ×4); the wielder may choose to deal this as damage to an undead target or to absorb half this amount as healing, with the remaining positive energy dissipating.

This special ability can only be placed on one-handed or two-handed firearms. A _lucky _firearm has its own magical reservoir of grit (see _Ultimate Combat_). Usually this grit is stored within the marks of an engraving or in a trinket that hangs from the firearm. Often these marks take the form of holy symbols or fetishes, but such a reservoir can take just about any form. This reservoir holds 1 grit point, which is refreshed at the start of each day. Whether or not the wielder of a _lucky_ firearm has any deeds (see _Ultimate Combat_), she can always spend 1 grit point from the _lucky_ firearm to reroll an attack from it that would result in a misfire. When the wielder does so, she must take the second result, even if that attack roll also results in a misfire.

Each time the wielder damages a creature using a _mimetic _weapon, he gains resistance 10 to one energy type that the creature is resistant or immune to for 1 round (if the creature damaged has multiple types of resistance, the wielder chooses one of those resistances to take).

Negating

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

A _negating _weapon briefly nullifies some forms of damage reduction when it damages a creature. Whenever a _negating _weapon damages a foe with DR/chaotic, DR/evil, DR/good, DR/lawful, or DR/magic, it reduces the value of that damage reduction by 5 points for 1 round. For example, a _+1 negating lance_ hitting a creature with DR 10/good and lawful reduces the creature's DR to 5/good and lawful. If the creature has a component to its damage reduction other than the alignment types listed above, that component is unaffected. Thus, if the _+1 negating lance _above hits a demon with DR 10/good and cold iron, it would leave the demon with DR 10/cold iron and 5/good for 1 round. The effects of multiple _negating _weapons (or multiple hits from the same weapon) do not stack. This ability can only be placed on melee weapons.

Spell Storing

A _spell storing_ weapon allows a spellcaster to store a single targeted spell of up to 3rd level in the weapon. (The spell must have a casting time of 1 standard action.) Anytime the weapon strikes a creature and the creature takes damage from it, the weapon can immediately cast the spell on that creature as a free action if the wielder desires. (This special ability is an exception to the general rule that casting a spell from an item takes at least as long as casting that spell normally.) Once the spell has been cast from the weapon, a spellcaster can cast any other targeted spell of up to 3rd level into it. The weapon magically imparts to the wielder the name of the spell currently stored within it. A randomly rolled _spell storing_ weapon has a 50% chance of having a spell stored in it already.

**Price** +3 bonus; **Aura** strong divination; **CL** 13th; **Weight** —

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A _spellstealing _weapon allows its wielder to siphon protective magic from a target and transfer it to herself. When the wielder rolls a critical threat against a target, she can forgo confirming the critical hit and instead automatically learn which spells or magical effects are active upon the target. The wielder may then make a caster level check to steal her choice of one of those effects, using the _spellstealing_ weapon's caster level plus its enhancement bonus, against a DC of 11 + the caster level of the effect. If the check succeeds, the target immediately loses the benefits of that effect and the wielder gains the effect for 1 minute (or until the effect expires, whichever comes first). If the _spellstealing _weapon has a critical multiplier greater than ×2, the wielder may attempt to steal one additional spell effect per additional multiple beyond ×2 (two effects for ×3, and so on).

Stalking

The longer the wielder of a _stalking_ weapon studies a target, the more effective her strike. As a standard action, a character wielding a _stalking_ weapon can command it to study a creature within 60 feet. The wielder must have line of effect and line of sight to that target. When the wielder attacks the studied creature, on a successful hit the _stalking_ weapon deals +1d6 points of bonus damage per consecutive round spent studying a target, up to a number of bonus dice equal to the _stalking_ weapon's enhancement bonus. This bonus damage is precision damage and only applies to the first successful hit against that creature.

If the wielder attacks a creature other than the studied creature, commands the weapon to study a different creature, or ends her turn more than 60 feet from the studied creature, the weapon loses all bonus damage dice against the previously studied creature.

Transformative

**Price** +10,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

This special ability can only be placed on melee weapons. A _transformative_ weapon alters its shape at its wielder's command, becoming any other melee weapon of the same general shape and handedness; the weapon's categorization as simple, martial, or exotic is irrelevant. For example, a Medium _transformative longsword_ can take the shape of any other Medium one-handed melee weapon, such as a scimitar, flail, or trident, but not a Medium light or two-handed melee weapon (such as a Medium short sword or a Medium greatsword). It can even take the shape of comparable weapons of different size categories. For example, a Small greatsword is a two-handed slashing weapon for a Small character, but is a one-handed slashing weapon for a Medium character, which is very similar to a Medium longsword; a Small _transformative greatsword_ can thus become an actual Medium longsword, usable by a Medium creature without the –2 penalty for using a weapon of the wrong size. The weapon retains all of its abilities, including enhancement bonuses and weapon special abilities, except those prohibited by its current shape. For example, a _keen transformative_ weapon functions normally in the form of a piercing or slashing weapon, but cannot use the _keen_ special ability when in the shape of a bludgeoning weapon. When unattended, the weapon reverts to its true shape.
