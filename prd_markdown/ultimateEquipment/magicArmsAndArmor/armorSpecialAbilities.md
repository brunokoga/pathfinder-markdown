# Armor Special Abilities

Enchanted armor is one of the most important things an adventurer can acquire—for what good is wealth and power when a dragon claw rips through your breastplate?

In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve AC. A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material.

Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be exchanged for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.

**Caster Level for Armor and Shields** : The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

**Shields** : Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a shield bash. The bashing special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).

A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to AC.

As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve AC. A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Activation** : Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).

**Armor for Unusual Creatures** : The cost of armor for non-humanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies. The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

## Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields have only enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

Adhesive

**Price** +7,000 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** —

On command, the hands and feet of this armor's wearer become incredibly sticky, granting her a climb speed of 20 feet. The stickiness grants the wearer a +2 enhancement bonus on combat maneuver checks made to disarm, grapple, reposition, steal, or trip when the wearer is using a natural weapon or unarmed strike to attempt the maneuver. The wearer can gain these benefits for 10 rounds per day. These rounds need not be consecutive, but they must be spent in 1-round intervals. Ending the effect is a free action. _Adhesive_ cannot be placed on armor with any version of the _ [slick](magicItems/armor#_armor-slick)_ special ability.

Animated

**Price** +2 Bonus; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 12th; **Weight** —

As a move action, an _ [animated](magicItems/armor#_armor-animated)_ shield can be loosed to defend its wielder on its own. For the following 4 rounds, the shield grants its bonus to the one who loosed it and then drops. While animated, the shield provides its shield bonus and the bonuses from all of the other shield special abilities it possesses, but it cannot take actions on its own, such as those provided by the _ [bashing](magicItems/armor#_armor-bashing)_ and _ [blinding](magicItems/armor#_armor-blinding)_ abilities. It can, however, use special abilities that do not require an action to function, such as _ [arrow deflection](magicItems/armor#_armor-arrow-deflection) _and _ [reflecting](magicItems/armor#_armor-reflecting)_. While animated, a shield shares the same space as the activating character and accompanies the character who activated it, even if the character moves by magical means. A character with an _ [animated](magicItems/armor#_armor-animated)_ shield still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it to end its animation as a free action. Once a shield has been retrieved, it cannot be animated again for at least 4 rounds. This special ability cannot be added to a tower shield.

Cost +2 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [animate objects](spells/animateObjects#_animate-objects)_

Arrow Catching

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapon attacks to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted. Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base AC bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's deflection bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [entropic shield](spells/entropicShield#_entropic-shield)_

Arrow Deflection

**Price** +2 bonus; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This shield protects the wielder as if he had the Deflect Arrows feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 Reflex save. If the ranged weapon (or piece of ammunition) has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not flat-footed. Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or _acid arrows_, can't be deflected.

Cost +2 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [shield](spells/shield#_shield)_

Balanced

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This armor pushes back against anything that threatens to knock its wearer to the ground. The wearer gains a +4 bonus to his Combat Maneuver Defense against combat maneuvers made to overrun or trip and on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) check made to maintain balance. Dropping prone while wearing _balanced_ armor is a move action instead of a free action. The _balanced_ ability can be applied to light or medium armors, but not heavy armors or shields.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [cat's grace](spells/catSGrace#_cat-s-grace)_

Bashing

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A _ [bashing](magicItems/armor#_armor-bashing)_ shield deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength#_bull-s-strength)_

Benevolent

**Price** +2,000 gp; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This suit of armor best serves a wearer who focuses on assisting and protecting his allies. _Benevolent_ armor is usually decorated with motifs of prosperity, plenty, and generosity, such as helping hands, cornucopias, and flourishing plants. When the wearer of a suit of _benevolent_ armor uses the aid another action to give an ally a bonus to AC against an opponent's next attack, he also adds the _benevolent_ armor's enhancement bonus to the ally's AC.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1,000 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [aid](spells/aid#_aid)_

Bitter

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This armor exudes an exceptionally vile and bitter taste whenever something bites or swallows a creature that is wearing it. Any creature that grapples the wearer with a bite attack (or any other attack using the mouth) must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save to avoid immediately ending the grapple.

If the wearer is swallowed whole, the swallowing creature must succeed at a DC 14 Fortitude save at the start of each turn that the armored victim remains alive inside of the creature or become nauseated for 1 round. The creature may vomit up the victim as a standard action. This is a poison effect.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [stinking cloud](spells/stinkingCloud#_stinking-cloud)_

Blinding

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Except for the wielder, anyone within 20 feet must make a successful DC 14 Reflex save or be blinded for 1d4 rounds.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [searing light](spells/searingLight#_searing-light)_

Bolstering

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint enchantment; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

Anytime the wearer of _bolstering_ armor damages a creature with a melee or ranged attack, he gains a +2 competence bonus on saving throws against that creature's abilities until the start of his next turn. The _bolstering_ ability can be applied to medium armor, heavy armor, light shields, heavy shields, and tower shields, but not light armor or bucklers.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [heroism](spells/heroism#_heroism)_

Brawling

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

The wearer of _brawling_ armor gains a +2 bonus on unarmed attack and damage rolls, including combat maneuver checks made to grapple. Her unarmed strikes count as magic weapons for the purpose of bypassing damage reduction. These bonuses do not apply to natural weapons. This special ability does not prevent the wearer's unarmed strikes from provoking attacks of opportunity or make the wearer's unarmed strikes count as armed attacks. The _brawling_ ability can be applied only to light armor.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength#_bull-s-strength)_

Champion

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This armor special ability works only for good creatures with the challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite evil ability (such as paladins, half-celestials, and creatures with the celestial creature template). A wearer with one of these abilities gains a +2 sacred bonus to AC against attacks from the chosen opponent.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [protection from evil](spells/protectionFromEvil#_protection-from-evil)_

Clangorous

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

A shield with this ability rings loudly when struck in combat. As an immediate action when the wearer is hit by an attack, the wearer can activate the shield to create a deafening bang equivalent to a thunderstone. If the attack is a critical hit, the wearer can instead create a _ [sound burst](spells/soundBurst#_sound-burst)_ (Fortitude DC 13 partial). The wearer decides the area for either effect, but must include the attacker in the area. Neither ability affects the wearer.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _deafness_, _ [sound burst](spells/soundBurst#_sound-burst)_

Creeping

**Price** +5,000 gp; **Aura** moderate illusion and transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

A suit of _creeping_ armor is made to keep the wearer's movement covert. The armor's armor check penalty does not apply to the wearer's [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks. Once per day, the wearer can speak a command word to grant himself a bonus on [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks equal to the armor's enhancement bonus for 1 minute.

Construction Requirements

Cost +2,500 gp

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [cat's grace](spells/catSGrace#_cat-s-grace)_, _ [invisibility](spells/invisibility#_invisibility)_

Dastard

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** faint abjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

This armor special ability works only for evil creatures with the challenge ability (such as cavaliers) or the smite good ability (such as antipaladins, half-fiends, and creatures with the fiendish creature template). A wearer with one of these abilities gains a +2 profane bonus to AC against attacks from the chosen opponent.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [protection from good](spells/protectionFromGood#_protection-from-good)_

Deathless

**Price** +1 Bonus; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 7th; **Weight** —

This armor protects its wearer from harmful negative and positive energy, including channeled energy. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of positive or negative energy damage per attack that the wearer would normally take. The wearer has a 25% chance to ignore negative levels from any attack. Deathless armor does not block healing of any kind and does not protect against positive or negative energy effects that do not deal damage or bestow negative levels. The _deathless_ ability can be applied to armor of any sort, but not shields.

Construction Requirements

Cost +1 bonus

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [death ward](spells/deathWard#_death-ward)_

Defiant

**Price** +1 bonus; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 8th; **Weight** —

Armor and shields with this special ability excel at blocking the attacks of certain types of creatures, similar to a _ [bane](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-bane)_ weapon's excelling against certain foes. Against the designated foe, the item's enhancement bonus to AC is +2 better than its actual bonus and provides DR 2/— against attacks from that foe. This increase in enhancement bonus applies only to the armor or shield's enhancement bonus, not to temporary bonuses (such as the _ [magic vestment](spells/magicVestment#_magic-vestment)_ spell). To randomly determine the armor or shield's designated foe, use the table for the _ [bane](magicItems/weapons#_weapons-bane)_ weapon special ability.

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [summon monster I](spells/summonMonster#_summon-monster-i)_

Delving

**Price** +10,000 gp; **Aura** faint transmutation; **CL** 5th; **Weight** —

Armor with this special ability grants the wearer a burrow speed of 10 feet. This speed allows the wearer to tunnel through any type of soil, including rocky soil, but not actual solid stone. This special ability does not give the wearer the ability to breathe underground, so he must hold his breath or use other magic that provides air or allows him to breathe. The wearer gains a +4 bonus on all saving throws against landslides, avalanches, tunnel collapses, and similar effects.

Hosteling

**Price** +7,500 gp; **Aura** moderate conjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** —

A suit of armor or shield with this special ability hides living animals within its iconography to keep it safe. The wearer can speak a command word to magically store an animal to which he is bonded, such as an animal companion, a familiar, or mount. The stored animal appears as a symbol emblazoned upon the armor or shield, either one that mimics the appearance of the animal or that is more symbolic and abstract.

While stored, the animal is sleeping and provides the wearer no benefit (such as a familiar's skill bonus). The size of animal that can be stored depends on the type of armor or shield. A suit of light armor, medium armor, or a light shield or heavy shield can store one animal up to the wearer's size. A suit of heavy armor or a tower shield can store one animal up to one size category larger than the wearer. A second command word releases the stored animal from the _hosteling_ armor or shield. A released animal immediately awakens, appears in a space adjacent to the wearer, and can take actions on the round it appears.

Because the stored animal is sleeping rather than in suspended animation (or even hibernating), it ages and gets hungry at the normal rate while stored. A _hosteling_ armor or shield automatically releases a stored animal 24 hours after it was stored inside.

This armor special ability still works on bonded magical beasts that were once animals, but not outsiders, oozes, or other exotic companion creatures.

Attack rolls with the weapon take a –2 penalty while merged with a light shield or a –4 penalty while merged with a heavy shield.
