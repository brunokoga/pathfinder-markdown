Bastard's Sting

**Price** 123,035 gp; **Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 18th; **Weight** 6 lbs.

This _+2 adamantine bastard sword_ becomes a _+5 [unholy](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_unholy) adamantine bastard sword_ in the hands of an antipaladin.

While wielded by an antipaladin, a _bastard's sting_ deals 2d6 points of negative energy damage to all living creatures that start their turn adjacent to the wielder. The antipaladin also gains fast healing 5 as long as at least one living creature takes damage from this negative energy. This negative energy has no effect on undead. The sword also enables the antipaladin to use _ [unholy blight](spells/unholyBlight.md#_unholy-blight)_ at will on command at the class level of the antipaladin. Paladins take a –2 saving throw penalty against this effect.

Beaststrike Club

**Price** 7,300 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 6th; **Weight** 3 lbs.

This _+1 club_ is often decorated with large teeth and carved with stylized images of different animals. As a standard action, the wielder may transform the club into the head or limb of an animal; the weapon's damage does not change but the type of damage changes to one of the following to suit the shape of the club: bite (piercing), claw (slashing), gore (piercing), slam (bludgeoning), sting (piercing), or talon (slashing). When transformed, the club counts as a natural weapon and a manufactured weapon for the purpose of spells and effects that enhance or improve either manufactured or natural weapons. The club also counts as the natural weapon of its current shape for the purpose of feats and spells that rely on specific natural weapons, such as [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) (bite) or the _ [bloody claws](advanced/spells/bloodyClaws.md#_bloody-claws)_ spell. If the wielder has the wild shape ability, she can expend one use of wildshape to increase the weapon's damage by one step for the duration of that wild shape as long as the druid remains in contact with the weapon; if the wielder can wild shape at will, the club's damage is always increased in this fashion. If unattended, the club reverts to its normal shape.

Craft Magic Arms and Armor, _ [shillelagh](spells/shillelagh.md#_shillelagh)_

Blade of Binding

**Price** 12,350 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** 8 lbs.

This _+1 greatsword_ is decorated with a lock motif. On a successful hit with the sword against a creature that is the wielder's size or smaller, the wielder can attempt to start a grapple as a free action that doesn't provoke an attack of opportunity. If the wielder succeeds at the grapple, the sword's blade transforms into a metal chain and wraps around the target, giving the wielder a +5 bonus on further grapple checks against the target. If the target escapes the grapple or the wielder decides to release the target from the grapple, the chain reverts to sword form (with the wielder holding the handle).

The wielder can also let go of the chain's handle while grappling or pinning the target; if he does so, the chain remains in place and the target gains the entangled condition ( [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) DC 20 to slip free, break DC 28, hardness 10, 10 hit points, concentration DC 17 to cast spells while entangled). Another creature can grab the chain's handle as a standard action and will it to revert to sword form as a swift action, which releases the bound creature. If the chain is destroyed, it reverts to sword form and the weapon gains the broken condition.

Blade of the Rising Sun

**Price** 51,850 gp; **Aura** strong evocation and necromancy; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 6 lbs.

This golden-bladed _+1 glorious undead [bane](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_bane) katana _shines like the first rays of the morning sun. Whenever the wielder of a _blade of the rising sun _threatens a critical threat (regardless of whether the critical is confirmed or whether the target is subject to critical hits), the target is surrounded by a halo of golden sunlight equivalent to _ [faerie fire](spells/faerieFire.md#_faerie-fire) _until the beginning of the wielder's next turn. Undead surrounded by this glow take 1d6 points of damage at the beginning of their turn.

The wielder of a _blade of the rising sun _may declare a sacrificial strike (similar to the retributive strike of a _ [staff of power](magicItems/staves.md#_staff-of-power)_) as a standard action, or as an immediate action before losing consciousness upon gaining the dying or dead condition. A sacrificial strike converts the wielder's body and spirit into raw energy equivalent to a _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst) _(DC 22). Allies of the wielder within the _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst) _are not harmed, and the wielder may choose to affect all allies within the _ [sunburst](spells/sunburst.md#_sunburst) _as _ [mass cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds-mass) _or all allies within 10 feet as _ [breath of life](spells/breathOfLife.md#_breath-of-life)_. The caster level for the effects of the sacrificial strike is equal to the sword's caster level plus 1/2 the wielder's level (maximum 25th level).

A sacrificial strike destroys the wielder's body (as the spell _ [disintegrate](spells/disintegrate.md#_disintegrate)_), but she has a 50% chance of being reincarnated (as the _ [reincarnate](spells/reincarnate.md#_reincarnate)_ spell) 24 hours after performing a sacrificial strike in a random safe location within 1 mile. The wielder's gear is left behind unharmed after the sacrificial strike; however, the _blade of the rising sun _is teleported to a random location at least 100 miles distant.

Blade of the Sword-Saint

**Price** 75,350 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 8th; **Weight** 6 lbs.

This exquisitely forged katana is the result of painstaking attention and craftsmanship by one who is dedicated to mastering swordplay in its highest form.

A blade of the sword-saint is a _+3 ki intensifying katana_. In the hands of a monk, it becomes an instrument of deadly utility. In addition to its more common properties, this weapon can be employed as though the wielder were unarmed: the wielder benefits from feats such as Deflect Arrows or Snatch Arrows (although he can redirect attacks but not catch them if he has no hands free), and a monk treats the blade as a monk weapon for use in his flurry of blows.

Bloodletting Kukri

**Price** 6,308 gp; **Aura** faint necromancy; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

On a successful critical hit, this _+1 kukri_ deals 2 points of bleed damage, which stacks with any bleed damage already caused by the attack. Each time the wielder strikes a blow that deals bleed damage with this weapon, he gains temporary hit points equal to the amount of bleed damage dealt. No temporary hit points are gained if the target was already bleeding, even for a lesser amount. Temporary hit points bestowed by the _bloodletting kukri_ last for 1 minute.

Bloodthirst Dagger

**Price** 60,802 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 1 lb.

The blade of this _+2 [wounding](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_wounding) dagger_ is brightly polished. Even when drenched in a victim's blood, it appears clean and dry moments later, as though it has been newly cleaned.

A _bloodthirst dagger_ rewards its wielder most when used relentlessly against a single target. When attacking a creature that is still bleeding from the _bloodthirst dagger_'s _ [wounding](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_wounding)_ property, the dagger deals an additional +1 point of damage against the target for each bleeding wound the creature possesses (maximum +10). Whenever the wielder of _bloodthirst_ confirms a critical hit with the weapon, she can choose to deal 1d6 points of additional damage for each still-bleeding wound the target possesses (maximum +5d6 damage). This additional damage is not multiplied by the critical hit, but is in addition to the damage normally added for bleeding wounds. Dealing this damage immediately heals all bleeding wounds possessed by the wielder.

Boulderhead Mace

**Price** 6,812 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 8 lbs.

The head of this _+1 heavy mace_ is made from a single piece of roughly spherical, polished granite. Once per day, the wielder can command the mace to release this head, which grows to the size of a Large boulder and rolls quickly in a direction the wielder specifies. The boulder rolls in a straight line for up to 60 feet, crushing everything in its path for 3d8+5 points of damage (Reflex DC 19 half). The boulder collapses into rubble and dust at the end of its path or if it encounters an obstacle it cannot break through or roll over, creating a 10-foot-square area of difficult terrain. A new stone mace-head grows on the weapon's haft over the next 24 hours, and it is unusable as a weapon until the head regrows.

Burrowing Bullet

**Price** Varies; **Aura** moderate necromancy; **CL** 3rd; **Weight** —

**Lesser burrowing bullet** 1,722 gp; **Greater burrowing bullet** 3,447 gp

This _+1 firearm bullet_ deals normal damage, but when it hits a living creature, it burrows into the creature's flesh, causing wracking pain until removed or until the bullet burrows its way out of the creature. While these bullets burrow, the creature is staggered. This effect lasts for 1d3 rounds or until the bullet is removed with a DC 15 [Heal](skills/heal.md#_heal) check made as a standard action. _Greater burrowing bullets_ take longer to pass though the bodies of living creatures (the staggered effect lasts 1d3+2 rounds) and are harder to remove (DC 20 [Heal](skills/heal.md#_heal) check as a standard action).

Cutthroat's Apprentice

**Price** 33,910 gp; **Aura** strong transmutation; **CL** 15th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This simply made _+1 [dancing](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_dancing) shortsword_ leaps to hand at the slightest touch. It can be drawn as a free action as though using the [Quick Draw](feats.md#_quick-draw) feat. The _cutthroat's apprentice_ dances for 8 rounds instead of 4 when activated, but can only dance twice per day. When dancing and attacking a creature, it moves into the target's space and provides the person who activated it (but no other creatures) with flanking during his turn if he attacks the same target in melee. Once the sword's activator completes his turn, the sword moves back to her space. If directed to attack multiple creatures in the same turn, the _cutthroat's apprentice_ provides a flank against only the last creature attacked.

Dagger of Doubling

**Price** 10,302 gp; **Aura** faint conjuration; **CL** 5th; **Weight** 1 lb.

A wielder with a free hand can split this _+1 dagger_ into two identical _+1 daggers_ as a swift action, or a free action if she has the [Quick Draw](feats.md#_quick-draw) feat. The doubled daggers can't be split again. If either dagger is thrown while doubled, the hurled dagger vanishes after resolving the attack and the remaining dagger can be split again. If the wielder drops a doubled dagger or it otherwise leaves her person, it vanishes. If both daggers leave the wielder's hands at the same time, determine randomly which dagger vanishes.

Spells or effects placed on a _dagger of doubling_ don't duplicate when the dagger is split. Any active effects on a dagger end when it vanishes. Destroying one of the doubled daggers just causes the duplicate to disappear, but any damage to a single _dagger of doubling_ remains on both daggers when it doubles.

The wielder can decide to use the power after he has struck. Doing so is a free action, but the poison effect must be invoked in the same round that the dagger strikes.

**Price** 60,312 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 5 lbs.

This weapon functions as a _+2 warhammer_ in the hands of most users. Yet in the hands of a dwarf, the warhammer gains an additional +1 enhancement bonus (for a total enhancement bonus of +3) and gains the _ [returning](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_returning)_ special ability.

This roughly hewn wooden haft is lashed with gut and rope to a hefty boulder. This _+1 shattering heavy flail _can strike devastating blows against objects. As a swift action, however, the wielder can suppress its _shattering_ property until the beginning of his next turn, allowing the head to phase through earth and stone. This allows the wielder to ignore cover or partial cover (but not total cover) provided by objects or structures made of earth or stone; however, while suppressed, an _earthenflail _cannot harm objects made of these materials. Cover provided by other sources is unaffected.

The holy water in this _+1 battle aspergillum_ never runs dry. However, the water vanishes 1 round after leaving the aspergillum, so it cannot be collected. As a full-round action, the wielder can swing the weapon to dispense a vial's worth of holy water as a ranged touch attack with a maximum range of 10 feet and no range penalty. An _everflowing aspergillum_ counts as a good-aligned weapon for purposes of overcoming damage reduction.

At such times it cannot be concealed when drawn, nor can its light be shut off. Its wielder is protected from fire; the sword absorbs the first 10 points of fire damage each round that the wielder would otherwise take.

A _frost brand_ extinguishes all nonmagical fires in a 20-foot radius. As a standard action, it can also dispel lasting fire spells, but not instantaneous effects. You must succeed at a dispel check (1d20 +14) against each spell to dispel it. The DC to dispel such spells is 11 + the caster level of the fire spell.

This ranged touch attack has a maximum range of 40 feet, deals 1d6+6 points of nonlethal cold damage, and leaves the target fatigued.

As black as coal, this short sword grows more potent the farther it is kept from light. It acts as a _+1 short sword _when in dim light. In darkness, it acts as _+2 short sword_. When surrounded by supernatural darkness, such as in an area of _ [deeper darkness](spells/deeperDarkness.md#_deeper-darkness)_, it acts a _+2 short sword_ and bestows the benefit of the [Blind-Fight](feats.md#_blind-fight) feat on its wielder.

This _+1 [dancing](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_dancing) short sword_ automatically rises up to defend a fallen or sleeping wielder. To activate the sword, the wielder must fall unconscious or die while wielding the weapon or holding it in her hand. Thereafter, should any creature other than an ally of the wielder attempt to touch or strike him with a melee attack, the sword attacks that creature for up to 4 rounds. After 4 rounds, the weapon drops in the wielder's square. Unless the _guarding blade_ is an intelligent item, it lacks the wits to make decisions about which is the best opponent to attack, and when confronted by multiple opponents attacking the wielder, it tends to select a random target each round.

This _+1 [unholy](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_unholy) scorpion whip_ (_Ultimate Combat_ 144) is fashioned from skin flayed from a barbed devil's back. It grants its wielder a +5 competence bonus on [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) checks. A shaken creature struck by the _hellscourge_ must succeed at a DC 17 Will save or become frightened for 1 round. A frightened or panicked creature struck must instead save or cower for 1d4 rounds. Both of these are mind-affecting fear effects.

If wielded by a person who wears _hamatula hide_ armor, the _hellscourge_ functions as a _+1 [flaming](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_flaming) [unholy](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_unholy) whip_.

The _ [silence](spells/silence.md#_silence)_ effect is not triggered by arrows that miss or those that strike an inanimate object.

A _greater hushing arrow_ functions just like a normal _hushing arrow_, except the target must succeed at a DC 16 Will save to avoid being silenced. _Hushing bolts_ and _greater hushing bolts_ can also be made; they share the same statistics as _hushing arrows_ and _greater hushing arrows_, except they weigh 1/10 of a pound per bolt.

This ornately designed _+1 lance_, decorated with ribbons and small favors, allows its wielder to more effectively knock an opponent from his mount. A successful hit with a _lance of jousting_ on a mounted opponent forces the target to make a [Ride](skills/ride.md#_ride) check (DC 10 + damage dealt) to avoid being knocked from the saddle.

Each time a creature takes damage from the _lash of the howler_, it must succeed at a DC 14 Reflex save or a quill breaks off and lodges in its flesh. The whip instantly sprouts a new quill to replace the one lost. The quill leaves the target sickened until it is removed. Removing a single quill from a creature requires a DC 15 [Heal](skills/heal.md#_heal) check made as a full-round action. For every 5 by which the check is exceeded, one additional quill can be removed. On a failed check, a quill is still removed but the process deals 1d4+1 points of damage to the victim.

This _+1 greataxe_ is favored by undead and constructs, who do not suffer its drawbacks. A life-drinker bestows two negative levels on its target whenever it deals damage, just as if its target had been struck by an undead creature. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.

She must take the result of the reroll, even if it's worse than the original roll. In addition, a luck blade may contain up to three _wishes_ (when randomly rolled, a luck blade holds 1d4–1 _wishes_, minimum 0).

Nine Lives Stealer

**Price** 23,057 gp; **Aura** strong necromancy; **CL** 13th; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This longsword always performs as a _+2 longsword_, but it also has the power to draw the life force from an opponent. It can do this nine times before the ability is lost. At that point, the sword becomes a simple _+2 longsword_ (with a faint evil aura). A critical hit must be dealt for the sword's death-dealing ability to function, and this ability has no effect on creatures not subject to critical hits. The victim is entitled to a DC 20 Fortitude save to avoid death. If the save is successful, the sword's death-dealing ability does not function, no use of the ability is expended, and normal critical damage is determined. This sword is evil, and any good character attempting to wield it gains two negative levels. These negative levels remain as long as the sword is in hand and disappear when the sword is no longer wielded. These negative levels never result in actual level loss, but they cannot be overcome in any way (including by _ [restoration](spells/restoration.md#_restoration)_ spells) while the sword is wielded.

Of elven make, this white _+2 composite longbow_ (+2 Str bonus) whispers "Swift defeat to my enemies" in Elven when nocked and pulled. Once per day, if the archer swears aloud to slay her target (a free action), the bow's whisper becomes the shout "Death to those who have wronged me!" Against such a sworn enemy, the bow has a +5 enhancement bonus, and arrows launched from it deal an additional 2d6 points of damage (and ×4 on a critical hit instead of the normal ×3). After an enemy has been sworn, the bow is treated as only a masterwork weapon against all foes other than the sworn enemy, and the archer takes a –1 penalty on attack rolls with any weapon other than the oathbow. These bonuses and penalties last for 7 days or until the sworn enemy is slain or destroyed by the wielder of the _oathbow_, whichever comes first.

The _oathbow_ may only have one sworn enemy at a time. Once the wielder swears to slay a target, he cannot make a new oath until he has slain that target or 7 days have passed. Even if the wielder slays the sworn enemy on the same day that he makes the oath, he cannot activate the _oathbow_'s special power again until 24 hours have passed from the time he made the oath.

This _+1/+1 meteor hammer_ is always made of ferrous metals, and has weighted spheres on either end of its sturdy dark chain. A wielder can use the magic within a _polarity hammer_ to attract or repel metal objects. In meteor mode, a wielder gains a +2 bonus on all drag and reposition combat maneuvers against any opponent wearing metal armor, carrying a metal shield, or made of metal (like an iron golem). In addition, if the wielder makes a successful trip attempt against such an opponent, she can push her enemy 5 feet away rather than pulling it forward.

In fortress mode, the wielder can use a move action to pick up any unattended metal object within her reach and deposit the item in any other square within her reach. Items so affected cannot exceed the size of a one-handed weapon equal to the wielder's size category. In this mode, the +1 shield bonus to Armor Class normally granted from wielding a meteor hammer increases to +3, but only against opponents wearing metal armor, carrying metal shields, or made of metal (as above).

This _+1/+1 darkwood quarterstaff_ grants superior balance and acrobatic skill. It glows with a faint green-yellow radiance when in use and can extend to nearly double its length, though only when being used to perform acrobatic feats. The wielder gains a +5 competence bonus on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks and can move at full speed without penalty when using [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) to move on narrow surfaces or uneven ground. When making a high jump while wielding the _quarterstaff of vaulting_, the [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) DC is equal to 3 times the height to be reached instead of 4.

In addition, with a successful DC 25 [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) check, the wielder can use the staff to vault over an opponent's head in place of taking a 5-foot step. She can only use this ability on creatures no more than one size category larger than her, and must end her movement in the nearest adjacent square on the opposite side of the creature.

This _+1 [returning](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_returning) light hammer_ can strike multiple foes with a single throw. If the wielder has multiple attacks from a high base attack bonus, he may throw the hammer so it rebounds off the first target to strike at a second target, and so on for each of the wielder's additional attacks. The distance to each target adds to the total range of the weapon, and range penalties apply. For example, a 6th-level dwarf fighter can throw the hammer using his +6 BAB at a target 20 feet away (within one range increment, no range penalty); if it hits, he ricochets it to attack using his +1 BAB at a second target 40 feet away from the first target (within three range increments for a –4 range penalty). The hammer can only ricochet if it successfully hits a target; if it misses, it stops ricocheting, has no further attacks that round, and returns as normal for a weapon with the _ [returning](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_returning)_ property. Because ricocheting attacks are treated as separate attacks, modifiers that only apply to one attack roll (such as _ [true strike](spells/trueStrike.md#_true-strike)_) only apply to the first attack and not the others. The ricochet attacks count as the wielder's additional attacks for that round.

The scimitar also reveals magical auras by touch; this functions as _ [detect magic](spells/detectMagic.md#_detect-magic) _but affects only a single object or creature at a time, which must be touched with the blade while the wielder concentrates on detection, and the magical auras revealed are clearly visible to all.

**Slaying arrow** 2,282 gp; **Greater slaying arrow** 4,057 gp

This _+1 arrow_ is keyed to a particular type or subtype of creature. If it strikes such a creature, the target must succeed at a DC 20 Fortitude save or take 50 points of damage. Note that even creatures normally exempt from Fortitude saves (undead and constructs) are subject to this attack. When keyed to a living creature, this is a death effect (and thus _ [death ward](spells/deathWard.md#_death-ward)_ protects a target). To determine the type or subtype of creature the arrow is keyed to, roll on the table below.

A _greater slaying arrow_ functions just like a normal slaying arrow, but the DC to avoid the death effect is 23 and the arrow deals 100 points of damage if the saving throw is failed.

Summoner's Sorrow

**Price** 42,816 gp; **Aura** moderate abjuration; **CL** 9th; **Weight** 10 lbs.

The _summoner's sorrow_ is a _+2 cold iron glaive_ that deals an extra 2d6 points of damage against summoned creatures, including eidolons. Once each round when the _summoner's sorrow_ damages a summoned or illusory creature, the wielder can make a dispel check as a free action to send away or destroy the creature. This is treated as a _ [dispel magic](spells/dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic)_ spell targeted against the spell that created the creature, except that the wielder's base attack bonus is used in place of the wielder's or item's caster level. This ability has no effect on creatures that are called rather than summoned, or on summoned creatures that cannot be dispelled, such as a summoner's eidolon.

Once per day as a free action, the wielder can attempt a _ [dismissal](spells/dismissal.md#_dismissal)_ against a creature damaged by the weapon instead of dispelling it. This ability functions only against extraplanar creatures (whether summoned or not), and works as the spell of the same name with a Will save DC of 17.

Sun Blade

**Price** 50,335 gp; **Aura** moderate evocation; **CL** 10th; **Weight** 2 lbs.

This sword is the size of a bastard sword. However, a _sun blade_ is wielded as if it were a short sword with respect to weight and ease of use. In other words, the weapon appears to all viewers to be a bastard sword, and deals bastard sword damage, but the wielder feels and reacts as if the weapon were a short sword. Any individual able to use either a bastard sword or a short sword with proficiency is proficient in the use of a sun blade. Likewise, [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) and Weapon Specialization in short sword and bastard sword apply equally, but the benefits of those feats do not stack.

In normal combat, the glowing golden blade of the weapon is equal to a _+2 bastard sword_. Against evil creatures, its enhancement bonus is +4. Against Negative Energy Plane creatures or undead creatures, the sword deals double damage (and ×3 on a critical hit instead of the usual ×2).

The blade also has a special sunlight power. Once per day, the wielder can swing the blade vigorously above his head while speaking a command word. The _sun blade_ then sheds a bright yellow radiance that acts like bright light and affects creatures susceptible to light as if it were natural sunlight. The radiance begins shining in a 10-foot radius around the sword wielder and extends outward at 5 feet per round for 10 rounds thereafter, to create a globe of light with a 60-foot radius. When the wielder stops swinging the sword, the radiance fades to a dim glow that persists for another minute before disappearing entirely. All sun blades are of good alignment, and any evil creature attempting to wield one gains one negative level. The negative level remains as long as the sword is in hand and disappears when the sword is no longer wielded. This negative level cannot be overcome in any way (including by _ [restoration](spells/restoration.md#_restoration)_ spells) while the sword is wielded.

Ten-ring sword

**Price** 14,315 gp; **Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 7th; **Weight** 4 lbs.

This finely crafted _+2 nine-ring broadsword _has an extra gap at the base of the blade's unsharpened edge, closest to the hilt, seemingly to fit an extra ring. The wielder of a ten-ring sword can use a full-round action to place a magic ring into the empty slot, where the ring then rests until removed (another full-round action). Once a ring is fitted to the tenth slot, the sword's wielder can employ that ring as if he were wearing it, even if he is currently wearing two magic rings.

Alternatively, the sword's wielder can fit a ring made of a specific metal like adamantine or cold iron into the tenth slot. Doing so allows the sword to penetrate damage reduction as if it were made of the same metal as the ring. Using this property does not grant the weapon any additional properties of that metal (such as bypassing hardness, etc.). Typically, such metal rings cost one-tenth the cost of a nine-ring broadsword made from that material. In the event that a magic ring made from a specific metal, like silver, is affixed to the sword's tenth slot, the sword's wielder decides which of the weapon's two properties will be in effect when the ring is placed. However, the sword's wielder can use a move action to switch between properties.

The wielder can use this effect up to three times per day. The wielder can communicate with the animals as if using a _ [speak with animals](spells/speakWithAnimals.md#_speak-with-animals)_ spell.

The bar acts as an _ [immovable rod](magicItems/rods.md#_immovable-rod)_, except instead of an activation button, the immobility power triggers whenever the wielder places one or both feet on the bar, and ends whenever the wielder is no longer touching the bar with at least one foot. If the wielder remains in place and steps on the bar, he gains a +10 bonus to his CMD when trying to resist efforts to move him. The wielder is always considered braced against oncoming charge attacks. If the wielder is falling, he may step on the bar as an immediate action to halt his fall, though the sudden jolt means he takes falling damage for the current distance fallen.

It functions as a _+1 [brilliant-energy](/prd/ultimateEquipment/magicArmsAndArmor/weaponSpecialAbilities.md#_brilliant-energy) scythe_, except the blade is formed of negative energy and gives off no light whatsoever. The wielder can channel negative energy directly into the scythe to charge it with life-destroying energy for 1 round per die of channeling. For example, channeling negative energy for 5d6 points of damage fuels the scythe for 5 rounds. While so charged, the _void scythe_ bestows one negative level with each hit. One day after being struck, subjects must succeed at a DC 16 Fortitude save for each negative level or the negative levels become permanent.

Black energy utterly consumes any creature that is slain by the _void scythe_, leaving no body behind but leaving the creature's equipment unharmed.
