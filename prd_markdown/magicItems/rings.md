# Rings

Rings bestow magical powers upon their wearers. Only a rare few have charges—most magic rings are permanent and potent magic items. Anyone can use a ring.

A character can only effectively wear two magic rings. A third magic ring doesn't work if the wearer is already wearing two magic rings.

**Physical Description** : Rings have no appreciable weight. Although exceptions exist that are crafted from glass or bone, the vast majority of rings are forged from metal—usually precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum. A ring has [AC](../combat.md#_armor-class) 13, 2 hit points, hardness 10, and a break DC of 25.

**Activation** : A ring's ability is usually activated by a spoken command word (a standard action that does not provoke attacks of opportunity) or its effects work continually. Some rings have unusual activations, as mentioned in the ring's specific description.

**Special Qualities** : Roll d%. A result of 01 indicates the ring is intelligent, 02–31 indicates that something (a design, inscription, or the like) provides a clue to its function, and 32–100 indicates no special qualities. Intelligent items have extra abilities and sometimes extraordinary powers and special purposes (see [Intelligent Items](intelligentItems.md)). Rings with charges can never be intelligent.

This ring might seem to be a _ring of spell storing _upon first examination. However, while it allows a single spell of 1st through 6th level to be cast into it, that spell cannot be cast out of the ring again. Instead, should that spell ever be cast upon the wearer, the spell is immediately countered, as a counterspell action, requiring no action (or even knowledge) on the wearer's part. Once so used, the spell cast within the ring is gone. A new spell (or the same one as before) may be placed into it again.

**Slot** ring; **Price** 125,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

One of the many rings of fable, this “genie” ring is useful indeed. It serves as a special _ [gate](../spells/gate.md#_gate) _by means of which a specific djinni can be called from the Plane of Air. When the ring is rubbed (a standard action), the call goes out, and the djinni appears on the next round. The djinni faithfully obeys and serves the wearer of the ring, but never for more than 1 hour per day. If the djinni of the ring is ever killed, the ring becomes nonmagical and worthless.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring](../feats.md#_forge-ring), _ [gate](../spells/gate.md#_gate)_; **Cost** 62,500 gp

**Ring of Elemental Command**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 200,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

All four kinds of _elemental command _rings are very powerful. Each appears to be nothing more than a lesser magic ring until fully activated (by meeting a special condition, such as single-handedly slaying an elemental of the appropriate type or exposure to a sacred material of the appropriate element), but each has certain other powers as well as the following common properties.

Elementals of the plane to which the ring is attuned can't attack the wearer, or even approach within 5 feet of him. If the wearer desires, he may forego this protection and instead attempt to charm the elemental (as _ [charm monster](../spells/charmMonster.md#_charm-monster), _ [Will](../combat.md#_will) DC 17 negates). If the charm attempt fails, however, absolute protection is lost and no further attempt at charming can be made.

Creatures from the plane to which the ring is attuned who attack the wearer take a –1 penalty on their attack rolls. The ring wearer makes applicable saving throws against the extraplanar creature's attacks with a +2 resistance bonus. He gains a +4 morale bonus on all attack rolls against such creatures. Any weapon he uses bypasses the [damage reduction](../glossary.md#_damage-reduction) of such creatures, regardless of any qualities the weapon may or may not have.

The wearer of the ring is able to converse with creatures from the plane to which his ring is attuned. These creatures recognize that he wears the ring, and show a healthy respect for the wearer if alignments are similar. If alignments are opposed, creatures fear the wearer if he is strong. If he is weak, they hate and desire to slay him.

The possessor of a _ring of elemental command _takes a saving throw penalty as follows:

| Element | Saving Throw Penalty |
| --- | --- |
| Air | –2 against earth-based effects |
| Earth | –2 against air- or electricity-based effects |
| Fire | –2 against water- or cold-based effects |
| Water | –2 against fire-based effects |

In addition to the powers described above, each specific ring gives its wearer the following abilities according to its kind.

_Ring of Elemental Command (Air)_

- _ [Feather fall](../spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall) _(unlimited use, wearer only)
- _ [Resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.md#_resist-energy) (electricity) _(unlimited use, wearer only)

**Ring of the Ram**

**Aura** moderate transmutation; **CL** 9th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 8,600 gp; **Weight** —

**DESCRIPTION**

The _ring of the ram _is an ornate ring forged of hard metal, usually iron or an iron alloy. It has the head of a ram as its device. The wearer can command the ring to give forth a ram-like force, manifested by a vaguely discernible shape that resembles the head of a ram or a goat. This force strikes a single target, dealing 1d6 points of damage if 1 charge is expended, 2d6 points if 2 charges are used, or 3d6 points if 3 charges (the maximum) are used. Treat this as a ranged attack with a 50-foot maximum range and no penalties for distance.

The force of the blow is considerable, and those struck by the ring are subject to a bull rush if within 30 feet of the ring-wearer. The ram is Large and uses the ring's caster level as its base attack bonus with a Strength of 25. This gives the ram a [Combat Maneuver Bonus](../combat.md#_combat-maneuver-bonus) of +17. The ram gains a +1 bonus on the bull rush attempt if 2 charges are expended, or +2 if 3 charges are expended.

In addition to its attack mode, the _ring of the ram _also has the power to open doors as if it were a character with Strength 25. This expends 1 charge. If 2 charges are expended, the effect is equivalent to a character with Strength 27. If 3 charges are expended, the effect is that of a character with Strength 29.

A newly created ring has 50 charges. When all the charges are expended, the ring becomes a nonmagical item.

**CONSTRUCTION**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring](../feats.md#_forge-ring), _ [bull's strength](../spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength), [telekinesis](../spells/telekinesis.md#_telekinesis)_; **Cost** 4,300 gp

**Ring of Regeneration**

**Aura** strong conjuration; **CL** 15th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 90,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This white gold ring is generally set with a large green sapphire. When worn, the ring continually allows a living wearer to heal 1 point of damage per round and an equal amount of nonlethal damage. In addition, he is immune to [bleed](../glossary.md#_bleed) damage while wearing a _ring of regeneration_. If the wearer loses a limb, an organ, or any other body part while wearing this ring, the ring _regenerates _it as the spell. In either case, only damage taken while wearing the ring is regenerated.

**Construction**

**Requirements** [Forge Ring](../feats.md#_forge-ring), _ [regenerate](../spells/regenerate.md#_regenerate)_; **Cost** 45,000 gp

**Ring of Shooting Stars**

**Aura** strong evocation; **CL** 12th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 50,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

This ring has two modes of operation: one for being in dim light or outdoors at night, and a second one when the wearer is underground or indoors at night.

During the night, under the open sky or in areas of shadow or darkness, the _ring of shooting stars _can perform the following functions on command.

- _ [Dancing lights](../spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights)_ (once per hour)
- _ [Light](../spells/light.md#_light)_ (twice per night)
- Ball lightning (special, once per night)
- Shooting stars (special, three per week)

The first special function, ball lightning_, _releases one to four balls of lightning (ring wearer's choice). These glowing globes resemble _ [dancing lights](../spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights)_, and the ring wearer controls them similarly (see the _ [dancing lights](../spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights) _spell description). The spheres have a 120-foot range and a duration of 4 rounds. They can be moved at 120 feet per round. Each sphere is about 3 feet in diameter, and any creature who comes within 5 feet of one causes its charge to dissipate, taking electricity damage in the process according to the number of balls created.

| Number of Balls | Damage per Ball |
| --- | --- |
| 1 lightning ball | 4d6 points of electricity damage |
| 2 lightning balls | 3d6 points of electricity damage each |
| 3 lightning balls | 2d6 points of electricity damage each |
| 4 lightning balls | 1d6 points of electricity damage each |

Once the ball lightning function is activated, the balls can be released at any time before the sun rises. Multiple balls can be released in the same round.

The second special function produces three shooting stars that can be released from the ring each week, simultaneously or one at a time. They impact for 12 points of damage and spread (as a _ [fireball](../spells/fireball.md#_fireball)_) in a 5-foot-radius sphere for 24 points of fire damage.

Any creature struck by a shooting star takes full damage from impact plus full fire damage from the spread unless it makes a DC 13 [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) save. Creatures not struck but within the spread ignore the impact damage and take only half damage from the fire spread on a successful DC 13 [Reflex](../combat.md#_reflex) save. Range is 70 feet, at the end of which the shooting star explodes unless it strikes a creature or object before that. A shooting star always follows a straight line, and any creature in its path must make a save or be hit by the projectile.

Indoors at night, or underground, the _ring of shooting stars _has the following properties.

- _ [Faerie fire](../spells/faerieFire.md#_faerie-fire)_ (twice per day)
- Spark shower (special, once per day)

The spark shower is a flying cloud of sizzling purple sparks that fan out from the ring for a distance of 20 feet in an arc 10 feet wide.

**Ring of Spell Storing, Minor**

**Aura** faint evocation; **CL** 5th

**Slot** ring; **Price** 18,000 gp; **Weight** —

**Description**

A _minor ring of spell storing _contains up to three levels of spells (either divine or arcane, or even a mix of both spell types) that the wearer can cast. Each spell has a caster level equal to the minimum level needed to cast that spell. The user need not provide any material components or focus to cast the spell, and there is no arcane spell failure chance for wearing armor (because the ring wearer need not gesture). The activation time for the ring is the same as the casting time for the relevant spell, with a minimum of 1 standard action.

For a randomly generated ring, treat it as a scroll to determine what spells are stored in it. If you roll a spell that would put the ring over the three-level limit, ignore that roll; the ring has no more spells in it.

A spellcaster can cast any spells into the ring, so long as the total spell levels do not add up to more than three. Metamagic versions of spells take up storage space equal to their spell level modified by the metamagic feat. A spellcaster can use a scroll to put a spell into the _minor ring of spell storing_.

The ring magically imparts to the wearer the names of all spells currently stored within it.
