In general, magic armor protects the wearer to a greater extent than nonmagical armor. Magic armor bonuses are enhancement bonuses, never rise above +5, and stack with regular armor bonuses (and with shield and magic shield enhancement bonuses). All magic armor is also masterwork armor, reducing armor check penalties by 1.

In addition to an enhancement bonus, armor may have special abilities. Special abilities usually count as additional bonuses for determining the market value of an item, but do not improve [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). A suit of armor cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents, including those from character abilities and spells) higher than +10. A suit of armor with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

A suit of armor or a shield may be made of an unusual material. Roll d%: 01–95 indicates that the item is of a standard sort, and 96–100 indicates that it is made of a special material (see [Equipment](../equipment.html)).

Armor is always created so that if the type of armor comes with a pair of boots, a helm, or a set of gauntlets, these pieces can be switched for other magic boots, helms, or gauntlets.

**Caster Level for Armor and Shields** : The caster level of a magic shield or magic armor with a special ability is given in the item description. For an item with only an enhancement bonus, the caster level is three times the enhancement bonus. If an item has both an enhancement bonus and a special ability, the higher of the two caster level requirements must be met.

**Shields** : Shield enhancement bonuses stack with armor enhancement bonuses. Shield enhancement bonuses do not act as attack or damage bonuses when the shield is used in a shield bash. The _bashing_ special ability, however, does grant a +1 bonus on attack and damage rolls (see the special ability description).

A shield could be built that also acted as a magic weapon, but the cost of the enhancement bonus on attack rolls would need to be added into the cost of the shield and its enhancement bonus to [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class).

As with armor, special abilities built into the shield add to the market value in the form of additions to the bonus of the shield, although they do not improve [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class). A shield cannot have an effective bonus (enhancement plus special ability bonus equivalents) higher than +10. A shield with a special ability must also have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Activation** : Usually a character benefits from magic armor and shields in exactly the way a character benefits from nonmagical armor and shields: by wearing them. If armor or a shield has a special ability that the user needs to activate, then the user usually needs to utter the command word (a standard action).

**Armor for Unusual Creatures** : The cost of armor for nonhumanoid creatures, as well as for creatures who are neither Small nor Medium, varies (see [Equipment](../equipment.html))_. _The cost of the masterwork quality and any magical enhancement remains the same.

## Magic Armor and Shield Special Ability Descriptions

Most magic armor and shields only have enhancement bonuses. Such items can also have one or more of the special abilities detailed below. Armor or a shield with a special ability must have at least a +1 enhancement bonus.

**Animated** : As a move action, an _animated shield_ can be loosed to defend its wielder on its own. For the following 4 rounds, the shield grants its bonus to the one who loosed it and then drops. While animated, the shield provides its shield bonus and the bonuses from all of the other shield special abilities it possesses, but it cannot take actions on its own, such as those provided by the _bashing_ and _blinding_ abilities. It can, however, use special abilities that do not require an action to function, such as _arrow deflection_ and _reflecting_. While animated, a shield shares the same space as the activating character and accompanies the character who activated it, even if the character moves by magical means. A character with an _animated shield_ still takes any penalties associated with shield use, such as armor check penalty, arcane spell failure chance, and nonproficiency. If the wielder who loosed it has an unoccupied hand, she can grasp it to end its animation as a free action. Once a shield has been retrieved, it cannot be animated again for at least 4 rounds. This property cannot be added to a tower shield.

Strong transmutation_; _CL 12th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [animate objects](../spells/animateObjects.html#_animate-objects); _Price +2 bonus.

**Arrow Catching** : A shield with this ability attracts ranged weapons to it. It has a deflection bonus of +1 against ranged weapons because projectiles and thrown weapons veer toward it. Additionally, any projectile or thrown weapon aimed at a target within 5 feet of the shield's wearer diverts from its original target and targets the shield's bearer instead. If the wielder has total cover relative to the attacker, the projectile or thrown weapon is not diverted. Additionally, those attacking the wearer with ranged weapons ignore any miss chances that would normally apply. Projectiles and thrown weapons that have an enhancement bonus higher than the shield's base [AC](../combat.html#_armor-class) bonus are not diverted to the wearer (but the shield's deflection bonus still applies against these weapons). The wielder can activate or deactivate this ability with a command word.

Moderate abjuration; CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [entropic shield](../spells/entropicShield.html#_entropic-shield)_; Price +1 bonus.

**Arrow Deflection** : This shield protects the wielder as if he had the [Deflect Arrows](../feats.html#_deflect-arrows) feat. Once per round when he would normally be struck by a ranged weapon, he can make a DC 20 [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save. If the ranged weapon (or piece of ammunition) has an enhancement bonus, the DC increases by that amount. If he succeeds, the shield deflects the weapon. He must be aware of the attack and not [flat-footed](../glossary.html#_flat-footed). Attempting to deflect a ranged weapon doesn't count as an action. Exceptional ranged weapons, such as boulders hurled by giants or _ [acid arrow](../spells/acidArrow.html#_acid-arrow)s_, can't be deflected.

Faint abjuration_; _CL 5th_; _ [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [shield](../spells/shield.html#_shield); _Price +2 bonus.

**Bashing** : A shield with this special ability is designed to perform a shield bash. A _bashing shield_ deals damage as if it were a weapon of two size categories larger (a Medium light shield thus deals 1d6 points of damage and a Medium heavy shield deals 1d8 points of damage). The shield acts as a +1 weapon when used to bash. Only light and heavy shields can have this ability.

Moderate transmutation_; _CL 8th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [bull's strength](../spells/bullSStrength.html#_bull-s-strength); _Price +1 bonus.

**Blinding** : A shield with this ability flashes with a brilliant light up to twice per day upon command of the wielder. Except for the wielder, anyone within 20 feet must make a DC 14 [Reflex](../combat.html#_reflex) save or be [blinded](../glossary.html#_blinded) for 1d4 rounds.

Moderate evocation_; _CL 7th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [searing light](../spells/searingLight.html#_searing-light); _Price +1 bonus.

**Energy Resistance** : A suit of armor or a shield with this property protects against one type of energy (acid, cold, electricity, fire, or sonic) and is designed with patterns depicting the element it protects against. The armor absorbs the first 10 points of energy damage per attack that the wearer would normally take (similar to the _ [resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy) _spell).

Faint abjuration; CL 3rd; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy); _Price +18,000 gp.

**[Energy Resistance](../glossary.html#_energy-resistance), Improved** : As _ [energy resistance](../glossary.html#_energy-resistance)_, except it absorbs the first 20 points of energy damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 7th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy); _Price +42,000 gp.

**[Energy Resistance](../glossary.html#_energy-resistance), Greater** : As _ [energy resistance](../glossary.html#_energy-resistance)_, except it absorbs the first 30 points of energy damage per attack.

Moderate abjuration; CL 11th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [resist energy](../spells/resistEnergy.html#_resist-energy); _Price +66,000 gp.

**Etherealness** : On command, this ability allows the wearer of the armor to become ethereal (as the _ [ethereal jaunt](../spells/etherealJaunt.html#_ethereal-jaunt) _spell) once per day. The character can remain ethereal for as long as desired, but once he returns to normal, he cannot become ethereal again that day.

Strong transmutation_; _CL 13th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [ethereal jaunt](../spells/etherealJaunt.html#_ethereal-jaunt); _Price +49,000 gp.

**Fortification** : This suit of armor or shield produces a magical force that protects vital areas of the wearer more effectively. When a critical hit or sneak attack is scored on the wearer, there is a chance that the critical hit or sneak attack is negated and damage is instead rolled normally.

| Fortification Type | Chance for Normal Damage | Base Price Modifier |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Light | 25% | +1 bonus |
| Moderate | 50% | +3 bonus |
| Heavy | 75% | +5 bonus |

Strong abjuration_; _CL 13th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [limited wish](../spells/limitedWish.html#_limited-wish) _or _ [miracle](../spells/miracle.html#_miracle); _Price varies (see above).

**Ghost Touch** : This armor or shield seems almost translucent. Both its enhancement bonus and its armor bonus count against the attacks of corporeal and [incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) creatures. It can be picked up, moved, and worn by corporeal and [incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) creatures alike. [Incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) creatures gain the armor's or shield's enhancement bonus against both corporeal and [incorporeal](../glossary.html#_incorporeal) attacks, and they can still pass freely through solid objects.

Strong transmutation_; _CL 15th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [etherealness](../spells/etherealness.html#_etherealness); _Price +3 bonus.

**Glamered** : Upon command, a suit of _glamered armor_ changes shape and appearance to assume the form of a normal set of clothing. The armor retains all its properties (including weight) when it is so disguised. Only a _ [true seeing](../spells/trueSeeing.html#_true-seeing) _spell or similar magic reveals the true nature of the armor when disguised.

Moderate illusion_; _CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [disguise self](../spells/disguiseSelf.html#_disguise-self); _Price +2,700 gp.

**Invulnerability** : This suit of armor grants the wearer [damage reduction](../glossary.html#_damage-reduction) 5/magic.

Strong abjuration and evocation (if _ [miracle](../spells/miracle.html#_miracle) _is used)_; _CL 18th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [stoneskin](../spells/stoneskin.html#_stoneskin), [wish](../spells/wish.html#_wish) _or _ [miracle](../spells/miracle.html#_miracle); _Price +3 bonus.

**Reflecting** : This shield seems like a highly polished mirror. Its surface is completely reflective. Once per day, it can be called on to reflect a spell back at its caster exactly like the _ [spell turning](../spells/spellTurning.html#_spell-turning) _spell_._

Strong abjuration_; _CL 14th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [spell turning](../spells/spellTurning.html#_spell-turning); _Price +5 bonus.

**Shadow** : This armor blurs the wearer whenever she tries to hide, while also dampening the sound around her, granting a +5 competence bonus on Stealth checks. The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.

Faint illusion_; _CL 5th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility), silence; _Price +3,750 gp.

**Shadow, Improved** : As _shadow_, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Stealth checks.

Moderate illusion; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility), silence; _Price +15,000 gp.

Strong illusion; CL 15th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility), silence; _Price +33,750 gp.

**Slick** : _Slick_ armor seems coated at all times with a slightly greasy oil. It provides a +5 competence bonus on its wearer's Escape Artist checks. The armor's armor check penalty still applies normally.

Faint conjuration_; _CL 4th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [grease](../spells/grease.html#_grease); _Price +3,750 gp.

**Slick, Improved** : As _slick_, except it grants a +10 competence bonus on Escape Artist checks.

Moderate conjuration; CL 10th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [grease](../spells/grease.html#_grease); _Price +15,000 gp.

Strong conjuration; CL 15th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [grease](../spells/grease.html#_grease); _Price +33,750 gp.

**[Spell Resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance)** : This property grants the armor's wearer [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) while the armor is worn. The [spell resistance](../glossary.html#_spell-resistance) can be 13, 15, 17, or 19, depending on the armor.

Strong abjuration_; _CL 15th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [spell resistance](../spells/spellResistance.html#_spell-resistance); _Price +2 bonus (SR 13), +3 bonus (SR 15), +4 bonus (SR 17), or +5 bonus (SR 19).

**Undead Controlling** : _Undead controlling armor_ or _shields_ often have skeletal or other grisly decorations or flourishes to their decor. They let the user control up to 26 HD of undead per day, as the _ [control undead](../spells/controlUndead.html#_control-undead) _spell. At dawn each day, the wearer loses control of any undead still under his sway. Armor or a shield with this ability appears to be made of bone; this feature is entirely decorative and has no other effect on the armor.

Strong necromancy; CL 13th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [control undead](../spells/controlUndead.html#_control-undead)_; Price +49,000 gp.

Moderate transmutation; CL 9th; [Craft Magic Arms and Armor](../feats.html#_craft-magic-arms-and-armor), _ [baleful polymorph](../spells/balefulPolymorph.html#_baleful-polymorph)_; Price +3 bonus.

**Demon Armor**

**Aura** strong necromancy [evil]; **CL** 13th

**Slot** armor; **Price** 52,260 gp; **Weight** 50 lbs.

**Description**

This plate armor is fashioned to make the wearer appear to be a demon. The helmet is shaped to look like a horned demon head, and its wearer looks out of the open, tooth-filled mouth. This _+4 full plate_ allows the wearer to make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and afflict the target as if she had been struck by a _ [contagion](../spells/contagion.html#_contagion)_ spell ( [Fortitude](../combat.html#_fortitude) DC 14 negates). Use of _ [contagion](../spells/contagion.html#_contagion)_ requires a normal melee attack with the claws. The âclawsâ are built into the armor's vambraces and gauntlets, and cannot be disarmed.
