Tieflings are humans with demonic, devilish, or other evil outsider blood in their ancestry. Often persecuted for their strange appearance and unnatural mannerisms, most tieflings disguise their nature or are forced to live on the fringes or underbelly of civilized society. Though they are not born evil, it is an easy path for them to find, especially as most suffer at the hands of “normal” folks while growing up. Tieflings look mostly human except for some physical traits that reveal their strange heritage.

## Tiefling Characters

Tieflings are defined by their class levels—they do not possess racial HD. They have the following racial traits.

**+2 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, –2 Charisma** : Tieflings are quick in body and mind, but are inherently strange.

**Darkvision** : Tieflings see in the dark up to 60 feet.

**Skilled** : Tieflings have a +2 racial bonus on [Bluff](../skills/bluff#_bluff) and [Stealth](../skills/stealth#_stealth) checks.

**Spell-Like Ability** : Tieflings can use _ [darkness](../spells/darkness#_darkness)_ once per day as a spell-like ability. The caster level for this ability equals the tiefling's class level.

**Fiendish Resistance** : Tieflings have cold resistance 5, electricity resistance 5, and fire resistance 5.

**Fiendish Sorcery** : See above.

**Languages** Tieflings begin play speaking Common and either Abyssal or Infernal. Tieflings with high Intelligence scores can choose any of the following: Abyssal, Draconic, Dwarven, Elven, Gnome, Goblin, Halfling, Infernal, and Orc.
