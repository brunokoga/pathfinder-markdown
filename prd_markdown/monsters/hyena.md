Hyenas are pack hunters infamous for their cunning and their unnerving, laughter-like vocalizations. They are largely scavengers, but aren't above supplementing their diet of carrion with fresh prey.

Hyenas tend to hunt alone, but when hunting as a pack they typically send one or two members against a foe's front while the rest of the pack circles and attacks from behind.

Many of the savage humanoid races, particularly gnolls, use hyenas as guard dogs. Such hyenas typically wear leather barding and are trained from birth to be vicious and savage—many such creatures are advanced hyenas.

Dire hyenas (known to many as hyaenodons) are more fearsome than their smaller cousins. While hyaenodons won't turn down carrion as a handy meal, they much prefer to hunt for prey. A pack of dire hyenas rarely stops moving and hunting for anything other than sleep, mating, or food. Hyaenodons are 6 feet tall at the shoulder and often over 12 feet long. They weigh 900 pounds.

Gnolls have been known to train hyaenodons to serve in their lairs as guardians, or more commonly as fearsome mounts.
