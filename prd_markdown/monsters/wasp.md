Giant wasps nearly always form nests, though not like their much smaller cousins. Each nest functions with one leader (the queen), a few workers, and several soldiers. The workers and the queen produce offspring while the soldiers protect the nest and hunt for food. Giant wasp nests are typically found in caves, abandoned houses, or any complex large enough to fit a dozen 10-foot-tall insects.

Giant wasps attack when hungry or threatened, stinging their prey to death. They take dead or incapacitated opponents back to their lairs as food for their unhatched young—the experience of lying in a wasp nest, paralyzed while its grubs feed, is one of nature's cruelest inventions. Even when part of a nest, giant wasps tend toward solitary hunting, and it's rare to see more than one at a time.

A wasp swarm is a flying mass of thousands of carnivorous wasps. In such large numbers, they become voracious hunters, capable of taking down large creatures with their venom-filled stings. While a wasp swarm is capable of inflicting hundreds of stings, its true danger arises from its insatiable appetite for meat.

Wasp swarms surround and attack any living prey in their paths, and are swift to seek out new prey once their anger is aroused. An enraged wasp swarm often loses track of its hive or the original source of its anger, and presented with a constant series of new targets to swarm and sting, a swarm can continue its rampage nonstop until it is destroyed or dispersed.
