**Special Abilities**

**Luminescence (Ex)** A fire beetle's glowing glands provide light in a 10-foot radius. A dead fire beetle's luminescent glands continue to glow for 1d6 days after its death.

Although nocturnal, the fire beetle lacks darkvision—it relies on its own glowing glands for illumination. Caged fire beetles are a popular source of long-lasting illumination among eccentrics and miners.

Other variations on the common fire beetle exist. The two most common variants are detailed below.

**Mining Beetle (CR 1/2)** : A mining beetle is an advanced fire beetle with the advanced simple template and a burrowing speed of 20 feet.

**Flash Beetle (CR 1/2)** : A flash beetle is an advanced fire beetle that can create a bright flash of light once an hour. When a flash beetle does so, all creatures in a 10-foot burst must make a DC 12 Fortitude save or be dazzled for 1d3 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Nearly 10 feet long, giant stag beetles become serious dangers when they wander into logging camps due to their appetite for decaying wood. Called stag beetles because of their large, antler-like mandibles, they use these appendages to wrestle competing suitors and quickly put down enemy threats.

Variant species of these giant beetles exist as well. The two detailed below are the ones most commonly encountered.

**Bombardier Beetle (CR 2)** : This giant stag beetle has only 2 Hit Dice and is Medium sized, but can spray acid once per round in a 10-foot cone. Those in the cone must make a DC 11 Fortitude save or take 1d4+2 points of acid damage. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Goliath Beetle (CR 8):** The immense goliath beetle is a Huge stag beetle with 12 HD and the trample special ability.
