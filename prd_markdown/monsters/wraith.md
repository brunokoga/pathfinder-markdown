**Special Abilities**

**Create Spawn (Su)** A humanoid slain by a wraith becomes a wraith in 1d4 rounds. These spawn are less powerful than typical wraiths, and suffer a –2 penalty on all d20 rolls and checks, receive –2 hp per HD, and only [drain](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain) 1d2 points of Constitution on a touch. Spawn are under the command of the wraith that created them until its death, at which point they lose their spawn penalties and become free-willed wraiths. They do not possess any of the abilities they had in life.

**Constitution Drain (Su)** Creatures hit by a wraith's touch attack must succeed on a DC 17 Fortitude save or take 1d6 points of Constitution [drain](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain). On each successful attack, the wraith gains 5 temporary hit points. The save DC is Charisma-based.

**Lifesense (Su)** A wraith notices and locates living creatures within 60 feet, just as if it possessed the blindsight ability.

**Sunlight Powerlessness (Ex)** A wraith caught in sunlight cannot attack and is staggered.

**Unnatural Aura (Su)** Animals do not willingly approach within 30 feet of a wraith, unless a master makes a DC 25 [Handle Animal](../skills/handleAnimal.md#_handle-animal), [Ride](../skills/ride.md#_ride), or wild empathy check.

Wraiths are undead creatures born of evil and darkness. They hate light and living things, as they have lost much of their connection to their former lives.

## Dread Wraith

A wraith that exists for long enough and feeds on enough life force undergoes an unholy transformation, becoming a creature known as a dread wraith. This causes the wraith to increase in size and strength, and to inflict 2d6 points of negative energy damage and 1d8 Constitution [drain](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain) with its incorporeal touch. You can create a dread wraith by applying the giant and advanced simple templates, or you can increase the basic wraith to a Large 16 HD [undead](creatureTypes.md#_undead).
