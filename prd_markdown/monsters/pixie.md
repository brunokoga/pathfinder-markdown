**Special Abilities**

**Invisibility (Su)** A pixie remains invisible even when it attacks. This ability is constant, but the pixie can suppress or resume it as a free action.

**Special Arrows (Su)** When a pixie fires an arrow from any bow, it can decide to change the arrow's properties by sprinkling it with magical pixie dust. Doing so is a free action as long as the pixie is the one who fires the arrow. A pixie can generate a number of uses of dust equal to its Charisma score each day (16 uses per day for most pixies)—the dust is useless to another creature unless the pixie gives the dust freely. In this case, the pixie chooses what effect the dust will have on an arrow when it is applied, and it takes a standard action to apply the dust to the arrow. Once pixie dust is applied to an arrow, the pixie's chosen effect persists on the arrow for only 1 round. As long as an arrow is altered in this way, it does not inflict damage when it hits—it only causes its new effect. A pixie can choose any one of the following three effects when dusting an arrow. Save DCs are Charisma-based.

_Charm_: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected as though by a _ [charm monster](../spells/charmMonster#_charm-monster) _spell for 10 minutes.

_Memory Loss_: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or be affected by a _ [modify memory](../spells/modifyMemory#_modify-memory)_ spell (this effect can only eliminate the previous 5 minutes of memory—a pixie typically uses this ability to make the target forget it encountered the pixie so it won't chase the pixie when he flees).

_Sleep_: The target must succeed on a DC 15 Will save or fall asleep for 5 minutes.

Perhaps the best-known and most elusive of all fey creatures, pixies live in the deepest, most pristine forests, but their insatiable curiosity often leads them far from home. Most pixies stand just over 2 feet tall—though they typically fly about the eye level of creatures they're conversing with in order to maintain eye contact—and weigh about 30 pounds. Pixies talk quickly and easily become overexcited.

Strange beings both of and beyond the natural world, pixies have magic that occasionally favors them in strange ways. For example, one out of every 10 pixies exhibits an additional spell-like ability that it can use once per day (caster level 8th), usually _ [baleful polymorph](../spells/balefulPolymorph#_baleful-polymorph),_ _ [beast shape II](../spells/beastShape#_beast-shape-ii)_ (Tiny creatures only), or even a powerful spell like _ [irresistible dance](../spells/irresistibleDance#_irresistible-dance)_. Alternatively, you can change the types of effects that pixie dust can have on arrows—as a general rule, these alternate effects should be mind-affecting effects. _Confusion_, _ [fear](../spells/fear#_fear)_, _ [hideous laughter](../spells/hideousLaughter#_hideous-laughter)_, and _ [hypnotism](../spells/hypnotism#_hypnotism)_ are all good choices for variant pixie arrow powers. You should take care when assigning alternate powers to a pixie, though, since doing so can create a threat that far exceeds what their physical statistics (and relatively low CR) can logically support.
