# Shadow

_Barely seen out of the corner of the eye, this wisp of [shadow](../magicItems/armor.md#_armor-shadow) is vaguely humanoid in outline and writhes with unholy life._

**Special Abilities**

**Create Spawn (Su)** A humanoid creature killed by a shadow's Strength [damage](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain) becomes a shadow under the control of its killer in 1d4 rounds.

**Strength Damage (Su)** A shadow's touch deals 1d6 points of Strength [damage](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain) to a living creature. This is a negative energy effect. A creature dies if this Strength [damage](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain) equals or exceeds its actual Strength score.

The sinister shadow skirts the border between the gloom of darkness and the harsh truth of light. The shadow prefers to haunt ruins where civilization has moved on, where it hunts living creatures foolish enough to stumble into its territory. The shadow is an undead horror, and as such has no goals or outwardly visible motivations other than to sap life and vitality from living beings.

# Shadow, Greater

_This shadowy figure sways and moves with an erratic grace, as if lit by an unseen fire._

Greater shadows are those undead shadows that have come to be particularly infused with negative energy, such as those that have spent vast lengths of time in areas of the Plane of Shadow awash in negative energy, or those that have drained the lives of thousands of victims. These undead monsters are often found with a small band of normal shadows, which typically treat a greater shadow as a leader to rally behind.
