Half-dragons are only rarely the result of dragons mating with other creatures—most are the result of strange magical experiments. In most cases, a successful creation breeds true with others of its kind, as with the dreaded dracolisk.

## Creating a Half-Dragon

“Half-dragon” is an inherited or acquired template that can be added to any living, corporeal creature (referred to hereafter as the base creature). A half-dragon retains all the base creature's statistics and special abilities except as noted here.

**CR** : Same as the base creature + 2 (minimum 3).

**Type** : Creature type changes to [dragon](creatureTypes.md#_dragon). Do not recalculate HD, BAB, or saves.

**Armor Class** : Nat. armor improves by +4.

**Special Qualities and Defenses** : A half-dragon gains darkvision 60 feet; low-light vision; and immunity to sleep, paralysis, and energy of the same type as its breath weapon.

**Speed** : A half-dragon has wings. Unless the base creature has a better fly speed, the half-dragon can fly at twice the creature's base land speed (average maneuverability).

**Melee** : A half-dragon has two claw attacks and a bite attack. If the base creature can use manufactured weapons, the half-dragon can as well. A new claw or bite attack deals damage as appropriate for the half-dragon's size (see [Natural Attacks](universalMonsterRules.md#_natural-attacks).)

**Special Abilities** : A half-dragon retains all the special attacks of the base creature and gains a breath weapon usable once per day based on the dragon variety (see below). The breath weapon deals 1d6 hit points of damage per racial HD possessed by the half-dragon (Reflex half; DC 10 + 1/2 creature's racial HD + creature's Con modifier).

| Dragon Variety | Breath Weapon |
| --- | --- |
| Black or copper | 60–foot line of acid |
| Brass | 60–foot line of fire |
| Blue or bronze | 60–foot line of electricity |
| Gold or red | 30–foot cone of fire |
| Green | 30–foot cone of acid |
| Silver or white | 30–foot cone of cold |

**Abilities** : Increase from the base creature as follows: Str +8, Con +6, Int +2, Cha +2.

**Skills** : A half-dragon with racial Hit Dice has skill points per racial Hit Die equal to 6 + its Intelligence modifier. Racial class skills are unchanged from the base creature's.
