**Special Abilities**

**Attach (Ex)** When a giant leech hits with a bite attack, it latches onto its target and automatically grapples. The giant leech loses its Dexterity bonus to AC and has an AC of 10, but holds on with great tenacity and automatically inflicts bite damage each round. A giant leech has a +8 racial bonus to maintain its grapple on a foe once it is attached. An attached giant leech can be struck with a weapon or grappled itself—if its prey manages to win a grapple check or [Escape Artist](../skills/escapeArtist.md#_escape-artist) check against it, the giant leech is removed.

**Blood Drain (Ex)** A giant leech drains blood at the end of each turn it is attached, inflicting 1 point of Strength and Constitution [damage](universalMonsterRules.md#_ability-damage-and-drain).

**Susceptible to Salt (Ex)** A handful of salt burns a giant leech as if it were a flask of acid, causing 1d6 points of damage per use.

These invertebrate parasitic relatives of the worm lurk in stagnant or slow-moving water, waiting for a suitable host.

**Poison (Ex)** Swarm—injury; _save_ Fort DC 15; _frequency_ 1/round for 2 rounds; _effect_ 1d4 Dexterity drain; _cure_ 1 save.

This horrifying cloud of ravenous, blood-draining parasites eschews the stealth of a lone leech's methods in favor of swift and merciless feeding.
