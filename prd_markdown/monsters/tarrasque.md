**Special Abilities**

**Carapace (Su)** The tarrasque's scales deflect cones, lines, rays, and _ [magic missile](../spells/magicMissile.md#_magic-missile)_ spells, rendering the tarrasque immune to such effects. There is a 30% chance a deflected effect reflects back in full force at the caster; otherwise it is simply negated.

**Powerful Leaper (Ex)** The tarrasque uses its Strength to modify [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks made to jump, and has a +24 racial bonus on [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) checks made to jump.

**Regeneration (Ex)** No form of attack can suppress the tarrasque's regeneration—it regenerates even if disintegrated or slain by a death effect. If the tarrasque fails a save against an effect that would kill it instantly, it rises from death 3 rounds later with 1 hit point if no further damage is inflicted upon its remains. It can be banished or otherwise transported as a means to save a region, but the method to truly kill it has yet to be discovered.

**Rush (Ex)** Once per minute for 1 round, the tarrasque can move at a speed of 150 feet. This increases its [Acrobatics](../skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) bonus on checks made to jump to +87.

**Spines (Ex)** The tarrasque can loose a volley of six spear-like spines from its body as a standard action with a toss of its head or a lash of its tail. Make an attack roll for each spine—all targets must be within 30 feet of each other. The spines have a range increment of 120 ft.

The legendary tarrasque is among the world's most destructive monsters. Thankfully, it spends most of its time in a deep torpor in an unknown cavern in a remote corner of the world—yet when it wakens, kingdoms die.

Although far from intelligent, the tarrasque is smart enough to understand a few words in Aklo (though it cannot speak). Likewise, it isn't mindless in its rampages, but instead focuses on targets that threaten it, and is difficult to distract with trickery.
