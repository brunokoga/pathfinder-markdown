## Creating a Skeletal Champion

“Skeletal Champion” is an acquired template that can be added to any corporeal creature (other than an undead) that has a skeletal system (referred to hereafter as the base creature) and a minimum Intelligence of 3.

**CR** : A skeletal champion's CR is +1 higher than a [normal skeleton](skeleton.md) with the same HD.

**Type** : The creature's type becomes [undead](creatureTypes.md#_undead). It keeps subtypes save for alignment subtypes and subtypes that indicate kind.

**Alignment** : Any evil.

**Armor Class** : Natural armor as [per skeleton](skeleton.md).

**Hit Dice:** Change all of the creature's racial HD to d8s, then add 2 racial Hit Dice to this total (creatures without racial HD gain 2). HD from class levels are unchanged.

**Defensive Abilities** : A skeletal champion gains DR 5/bludgeoning, channel resistance +4, and immunity to cold. It also gains all of the standard undead traits.

**Speed** : As [standard skeleton](skeleton.md).

**Attacks** : As [standard skeleton](skeleton.md).

**Abilities** : Str +2, Dex +2. As undead, it has no Constitution score.

**BAB** : Its BAB for racial HD equals 3/4 of its HD.

**Skills** : Gains skill ranks per racial Hit Die equal to 4 + its Int modifier. Class skills for racial HD are [Climb](../skills/climb.md#_climb), [Disguise](../skills/disguise.md#_disguise), [Fly](../skills/fly.md#_fly), [Intimidate](../skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate), [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (arcana), [Knowledge](../skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (religion), [Perception](../skills/perception.md#_perception), [Sense Motive](../skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive), [Spellcraft](../skills/spellcraft.md#_spellcraft), and [Stealth](../skills/stealth.md#_stealth). Skills gained from class levels remain unchanged.

**Feats** : A skeletal champion gains [Improved Initiative](../feats.md#_improved-initiative) as a bonus feat.

**Saves** : Base save bonuses for racial Hit Dice are Fort +1/3 HD, Ref +1/3 HD, and Will +1/2 HD + 2.
