**Special Abilities**

**Electricity (Ex)** An electric eel can produce a powerful jolt of electricity from its tail, delivering the jolt with a successful touch attack. On a critical hit, the creature struck must make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be stunned for 1d4 rounds. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The electric eel is a curious fish that breathes air instead of water, yet certainly its most unusual characteristic is its ability to generate powerful jolts of electricity. An electric eel is 6 feet long and weighs 45 pounds.

**Special Abilities**

**Gnaw (Ex)** If a giant moray begins a round with a grabbed foe, it inflicts automatic bite damage (2d6+9 points of damage). A giant moray eel possesses a second set of jaws in its throat that aid in swallowing—it can make a second bite attack (+11 attack, 1d6+3) against a foe it has already grabbed.

The moray eel is a ferocious predator, capable of holding prey in its primary jaws while a smaller set of jaws inside its throat chews away bite-sized portions.
