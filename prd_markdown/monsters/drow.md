Although related to the elves, the drow are a vile and evil cousin at best. Sometimes called dark elves, these cunning creatures prowl the caves and tunnels of the world below, ruling vast subterranean cities through fear and might. Worshiping demons and enslaving most races they encounter, the drow are among the underworld's most feared and hated denizens.

Drow are shorter and a bit more slender than their surface-dwelling kin, but they are otherwise physically similar. Drow have dark skin, ranging from black to a hazy purple hue. Most drow have white or silver hair and white or red eyes, but other colors are not unheard of.

Drow society is ruled over by powerful nobility, themselves governed by sadistic and dangerous matriarchs who constantly plot and scheme against rival houses and lesser kin within their own families. The majority of drow are the common soldiers and decadent citizenry, with base stats as presented here—drow nobles are more powerful and dangerous, and are detailed below.

In combat, drow are thoroughly ruthless, with little regard for fairness or mercy. They prefer to attack from ambush or to lure enemies into situations where they clearly have the upper hand. If things turn against them, drow are quick to flee, leaving slaves and minions to cover their escape.

## Drow Nobility

About one out of every 20 drow is gifted with special powers from birth—the overwhelming majority of these exceptional drow are female, and as a result, drow society tends to be matriarchal in nature. These special births are engineered and encouraged among the ruling caste, and are far more likely to occur when the mother is of noble heritage. Strangely, the status of the father seems not to increase or decrease the chances of a child being born a drow noble. Common drow children born to nobles are usually put to death—sacrificed to one of the many demon gods to whom the drow offer worship. It is rare for a drow noble to be born to common parents, but those who are usually murder their parents or family before they come of age in order to hide the truth of their base upbringing and to ease the processes of joining one of their society's noble houses. Drow nobles are more powerful than the majority of their kin, and as such they quickly rise to power within their houses. Advancement through the hierarchy of a drow noble house is usually accomplished through a combination of assassination, seduction, and treachery, leading most drow in power to be overly paranoid.

## Drow Noble Characters

Drow nobles are defined by their class levels—they do not possess racial Hit Dice. A drow noble's challenge rating is equal to her class level. Drow nobles possess all of the racial traits listed above for drow characters, plus the following.

**+4 Dexterity, +2 Intelligence, +2 Wisdom, +2 Charisma, –2 Constitution** . Noble drow are very agile, observant, and regal. These ability score modifiers replace the standard drow ability score modifiers.

**Spell Resistance:** Drow nobles have spell resistance equal to 11 + their character level.

**Spell-Like Abilities** : Drow nobles can cast _ [dancing lights](../spells/dancingLights.md#_dancing-lights)_, [_deeper darkness_](../spells/deeperDarkness.md#_deeperDarkness), _ [faerie fire](../spells/faerieFire.md#_faerie-fire)_, _ [feather fall](../spells/featherFall.md#_feather-fall)_, and _ [levitate](../spells/levitate.md#_levitate)_ each at will, and have _ [detect magic](../spells/detectMagic.md#_detect-magic)_ as a constant spell-like ability. A drow noble can also cast _ [divine favor](../spells/divineFavor.md#_divine-favor)_, _ [dispel magic](../spells/dispelMagic.md#_dispel-magic)_, and _ [suggestion](../spells/suggestion.md#_suggestion)_ once per day each. In some cases, a drow noble's spell-like abilities might vary, although the level of a particular spell-like ability does not. A drow noble's caster level for her spell-like abilities is equal to her character level.
