A large, powerful omnivore, the grizzly bear inhabits many of the world's forested hills. Equally happy consuming nuts, berries, fish, or small mammals, the grizzly is nonetheless fiercely territorial, and will chase off—or, failing that, kill and eat—any intruders it views as competition.

When faced with a foe or small group of threats, the grizzly attempts to subdue or kill with its claws. When it can, the bear tries to grab a single target to deal continual damage until that target is dead, unconscious, or escapes.

To generate stats for a smaller bear (like a black bear), you can apply the young simple template to the grizzly bear's stat block. To generate stats for a larger grizzly or a polar bear, apply the advanced simple template to the grizzly's stats.

Larger, more aggressive, and far more deadly than its lesser cousins, the dire bear (known to barbarian tribes variously as the cave bear or the short-faced bear) is a primeval menace indeed. This behemoth avoids more civilized reaches of the world, preferring to dwell in remote wilderness locations. A dire bear is a rare and terrifying sight—especially to those not used to normal bears.

Unlike most bears, a dire bear is short-tempered and swift to anger when confronted with intruders in its territory. Like a grizzly, a dire bear attempts to subdue or kill with its claws. However, a dire bear is far more likely (and willing) to begin biting a grabbed foe.
