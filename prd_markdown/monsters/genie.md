**Air Mastery (Ex)** Airborne creatures take a –1 penalty on attack and damage rolls against a djinni.

The djinn (singular djinni) are genies from the Plane of Air. They are said to be made of the stuff of clouds, with the strength of the mightiest storms. A djinni is about 10 feet tall and weighs about 1,000 pounds.

Djinn disdain physical combat, preferring to use their magical powers and aerial abilities against foes. A djinni overmatched in combat usually takes flight and becomes a whirlwind to harass those who follow. When faced with no other option than melee combat, most djinn prefer to wield masterwork scimitars two-handed.

Among other genies, djinn get along well with jann and marids. They are frequently at odds with the shaitans, and are sworn enemies of the efreet, despising these fiery genies more than any other genie race. So legendary is the conflict between the efreet and the djinn that many spellcasters attempt (to varying degrees of success) to secure a djinni's servitude by promising to aid the cause against their hated enemies.

A small percentage of djinn are noble. Noble djinn, often called viziers, have 10 Hit Dice, Strength 23, and Charisma 17, and can grant three _wishes _to any being (nongenies only) who captures them. Djinn nobles are CR 8.

A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

**Heat (Ex)** An efreeti's body deals 1d6 points of fire damage whenever it hits in melee, or in each round it grapples.

The efreet (singular efreeti) are genies from the Plane of Fire. An efreeti stands about 12 feet tall and weighs about 2,000 pounds.

Efreet have few allies among geniekind. They certainly hate djinn, and attack them on sight. They hold an equally strong enmity for marids, and view the jann as frail and weak. Efreet often work closely with shaitans, yet even then alliances are temporary at best.

A small percentage of efreet are noble. Noble efreet, often called maliks, have 13 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—_ [fireball](../spells/fireball.html#_fireball), [heat metal](../spells/heatMetal.html#_heat-metal)_; 1/day—_ [greater invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility-greater)_, _pyroclastic storm_ (as _ [ice storm](../spells/iceStorm.html#_ice-storm)_, with fire instead of cold damage). A noble efreeti's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 15th. Noble efreet are CR 10.

**Treasure** standard (chainmail, composite longbow [+3 Str], scimitar, other gear)

**Special Abilities**

**Change Size**  **(Sp)** Twice per day, a janni can magically change a creature's size. This works just like an _ [enlarge person](../spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person) _or _ [reduce person](../spells/reducePerson.html#_reduce-person) _spell (the janni chooses when using the ability), except that the ability can work on the janni. A DC 13 Fortitude save negates the effect. The save DC is Charisma-based. This is the equivalent of a 2nd-level spell.

**Elemental [Endurance](../feats.html#_endurance) (Ex)** Jann can remain on the Planes of Air, Earth, Fire, or Water for up to 48 hours at a time. Failure to return to the Material Plane before that time expires causes a janni to take 1 point of damage per additional hour spent on the elemental plane, until it dies or returns to the Material Plane.

The jann (singular janni) are the weakest of the genies. Jann are formed out of all four elements and must therefore spend most of their time on the Material Plane. Some lore even casts the janni as the most âhumanâ of the genie races, although most jann are quick to correct this insult, usually with the edge of a sword. A janni is human-sized, standing about 6 feet tall and weighing about 180 pounds.

Jann are physically strong and courageous, and do not take kindly to insult or injury. Most are quite prone to seeing insult even when none is intended by the speaker. If overwhelmed in battle, they escape using flight and _ [invisibility](../spells/invisibility.html#_invisibility)_, returning later with reinforcements.

Jann enjoy their privacy, preferring the solitude of the deep desert and isolated oases. They are usually suspicious of humans, but are often willing to give them the benefit of the doubt. Jann have a strong cultural tradition of hospitality, and will never turn away someone in need of food, water, or shelter, though they might expect payment in the form of a favor at some later date.

Among the other genie races, jann generally have good relations with both djinn and shaitans. While not actively enemies, jann dislike the proud and aloof marids. Jann have a distinct aversion to the efreet, who often try to enslave them or conscript them into their armies.

A small percentage of jann are noble. Noble jann, often called sheikhs or amirs, have 9 Hit Dice, Strength 19, and Intelligence 18, and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—_ [augury](../spells/augury.html#_augury)_, _ [detect magic](../spells/detectMagic.html#_detect-magic)_, and _ [divination](../spells/divination.html#_divination)_. A noble janni's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 12th. Noble jann are CR 7.

**Water's Fury (Su)** As a standard action, a marid can release a jet of water in a 60-foot line that deals 1d6 points of damage and blinds the target struck for 1d6 rounds. A DC 20 Reflex save reduces the damage by half and negates the blinding effect. The save DC is Constitution-based.

**Vortex (Su)** A marid can transform into a vortex of swirling, churning water once every 10 mintues. This ability functions identically to the [whirlwind](universalMonsterRules.html#_whirlwind) ability, save that it can only be used while the marid is underwater; a marid cannot leave a body of water while in vortex form.

Marids are genies from the Plane of Water. The most powerful of all the genie races, they are said to possess the strength of the ocean's currents and teeth made of pearl. A marid stands about 16 feet tall and weighs nearly 2,500 pounds.

The marids are perhaps the most unpredictable and capricious of the genies, a quality that the others (particularly shaitans) find to be both aggravating and embarrassing to the entire genie culture. Many marids become dancers, storytellers, performers, or other types of artists, and often travel to the Material Plane in disguise to seek out new audiences.

A small percentage of marids can lay claim to nobility. Noble marids, often called shahzadas, have 14 Hit Dice and gain the following spell-like abilities: 3/day—_ [cone of cold](../spells/coneOfCold.html#_cone-of-cold), [ice storm](../spells/iceStorm.html#_ice-storm)_; 1/day—_ [elemental swarm](../spells/elementalSwarm.html#_elemental-swarm)_ (water elementals only), _ [permanent image](../spells/permanentImage.html#_permanent-image)_. A noble marid's caster level for its spell-like abilities is 20th. Noble marids are CR 11.

**Stone Curse (Su)** If a shaitan wins a bull rush check by 5 or more and pushes its target into a stone barrier, the target must make a DC 19 Reflex save or be forced into the barrier as if the target had cast _ [meld into stone](../spells/meldIntoStone.html#_meld-into-stone)_ until the victim makes a successful DC 19 Fortitude save as a full-round action to exit the stone.
