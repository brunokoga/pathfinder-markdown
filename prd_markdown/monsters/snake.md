Be they jungle-dwelling pythons or swamp-dwelling boas like the anaconda, constrictor snakes are among the most deadly predatory animals of the tropical wilds. Fortunately, these large snakes are relatively passive, save for when they are preparing to shed their skins or are particularly hungry. Nevertheless, the sinuous creatures are held in fear by many societies who often ascribe fiendish qualities to them.

The constrictor snake presented here is a relatively small one. You can create stats for a larger maneater like an anaconda by applying the advanced and giant simple templates, or by advancing the stats above to a 7 HD Large snake (CR 5), or even a 14 HD Huge snake (CR 10).

Countless species of poisonous snakes dwell in the wild, their bites capable of bringing down creatures much larger than themselves. Snakes of the size presented here are thankfully rarer than their smaller kin, but many species of rattlesnake, cobra, and similar reptiles can grow to this size.

Venomous snakes are generally far more aggressive than constrictor snakes, and even larger variants do exist: you can create stats for a king cobra, for example, by applying the advanced and giant simple templates to the stats given above.
