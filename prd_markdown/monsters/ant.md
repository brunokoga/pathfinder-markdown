**Special Abilities**

**Cling (Ex)** If a creature leaves an army ant swarm's square, the swarm suffers 1d6 points of damage to reflect the loss of its numbers as several of the crawling pests continue to cling tenaciously to the victim. A creature with army ants clinging to him takes 3d6 points of damage at the end of his turn each round. As a full-round action, he can remove the ants with a DC 17 Reflex save. High wind or any amount of damage from an area effect destroys all clinging ants. The save DC is Dexterity-based.

**Consume (Ex)** An army ant swarm can rapidly consume any creature it swarms over. Against helpless or nauseated targets, an army ant swarm attack deals 6d6 points of damage.

The notoriety of the army ant swarm is well earned. Constantly on the march, a hive of army ants is capable of eating anything that gets in the way of its unabating swath of destruction and ruin.

Giant ants are as industrious as their normal-sized kin. While their nests generally don't consist of thousands, their greatly increased size more than compensates.

The statistics given above are for soldier ants—the variety most commonly encountered. The following simple templates can be used to create variants of the standard soldier ant.

**Worker (–1 CR)** Worker ants do not have a poison sting attack or a grab special attack.

**Drone (+1 CR)** Drones have the advanced simple template and a fly speed of 30 feet (average).

**Queen (+2 CR)** The queen of a nest is an immense, bloated creature. She gains the advanced and the giant simple templates, but drops her speed to 10 feet and loses her climb speed entirely.
