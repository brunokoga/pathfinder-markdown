**Smoke (Su)** In battle, a nightmare exhales smoke that chokes and blinds foes, filling a 15-foot cone each round as a free action. Anyone in the cone must succeed on a DC 16 Fortitude save or become sickened until 1d6 minutes after leaving the area. This smoke acts as _ [obscuring mist](../spells/obscuringMist.html#_obscuring-mist)_ for the purposes of concealment. The smoke persists for 1 round. The save DC is Constitution-based.

Nightmares are flaming harbingers of death. They allow only the most evil of creatures to ride them, and are never mere mounts, but rather willing partners in destruction.

The cauchemar is a more dangerous variant of the nightmare, particularly valued for its ability to enter the Ethereal Plane with its rider in addition to being able to use _ [plane shift](../spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift)_ to invade other realities.

# Nightmare, Cauchemar

_This towering, burning equine stands upon smoking hooves. Hellfire shimmers in its hateful eyes._
