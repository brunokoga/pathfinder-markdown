**Ink Cloud (Ex)** A squid can emit a 5-foot-radius cloud of ink once per minute as a free action while underwater. This cloud provides total concealment. The ink persists for 1 minute.

**Jet (Ex)** A squid can jet in a straight line as a full-round action. It does not provoke attacks of opportunity while jetting.

Squids are aggressive predators that fear little and are more than willing to attack prey larger than themselves.

The giant squid is a legendary beast capable of feeding on humans with ease. Hunger has been known to drive these normally deep-dwelling creatures up to the ocean surface where anything they encounter is potential prey. A giant squid is 45 feet long and weighs 1,500 pounds.
