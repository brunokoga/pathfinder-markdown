**Rage (Ex)** A wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a rage on its next turn, clawing and biting madly until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and –2 to AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.

Wolverines are territorial, especially when it comes to food, and have been known to defend their kills against much larger predators, such as black bears. They are fearsome opponents, launching into a frenzy when wounded. They tend to give off a very strong, unpleasant musk smell when angry.

Armed with powerful jaws, strong legs, and a thick hide, wolverines are remarkably strong for their size. They are reckless in battle and throw themselves at their foes, clawing and biting furiously.

**Rage (Ex)** A dire wolverine that takes damage in combat flies into a rage on its next turn, madly clawing and biting until either it or its opponent is dead. It gains +4 to Strength, +4 to Constitution, and –2 to AC. The creature cannot end its rage voluntarily.

Dire wolverines tend to be even more territorial than their smaller wolverine cousins, and they defend to the death the areas where they choose to live, often selecting humanoid-settled regions as their own and then fearlessly tearing the settlements apart. Dire wolverines grow to about 12 feet in length and can weigh as much as 2,000 pounds.
