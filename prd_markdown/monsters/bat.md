The dire bat is usually found lairing in desolate areas, resting in caves or other secluded areas during the day and taking to the skies in search of prey at night. This immense creature has an average wingspan of 15 feet and weighs roughly 200 pounds.

The dire bat generally doesn't shelter in groups larger than eight, often living a solitary life. A dire bat prefers feeding on livestock and herd animals.

**Special Features**

**Wounding (Ex)** Any living creature damaged by a bat swarm continues to [bleed](universalMonsterRules#_bleed), losing 1 hit point per round thereafter. Multiple wounds do not result in cumulative bleeding loss. The bleeding can be stopped by a DC 10 [Heal](../skills/heal#_heal) check or the application of a cure spell or some other healing magic.

Bat swarms dwell in large caves, ruins, or even city sewers—anywhere they can find darkness to hide in during the day and a supply of food to feast upon at night. They are only encountered outside in a group at dawn or dusk, or when they have been startled and forced to flee their lairs.
