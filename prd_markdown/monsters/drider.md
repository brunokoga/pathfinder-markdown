**Spells** A drider casts spells as a 6th-level cleric, sorcerer, or wizard, but does not gain any other class abilities.

**Undersized Weapons (Ex)** Although a drider is Large, its upper torso is the same size as that of a Medium humanoid's upper torso. As a result, it wields weapons as if it were one size category smaller than its actual size (Medium for most driders).

Created from the body of a drow, warped and mutated through special poisons and elixirs to take on the characteristics of a giant spider, the drider is a dangerous creature.

Driders are sexually dimorphic. A female drider's lower spider body is sleek and graceful, often similar to a black widow's body, while its upper drow torso retains its alluring curves and beautiful face (with the exception of sharp, poisonous fangs). A male drider's lower body is bulky like a tarantula, while its upper body is wiry and bears a hideous face more spider than drow, complete with fanged mandibles.
