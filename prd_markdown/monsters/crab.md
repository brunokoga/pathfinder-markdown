**Water Dependency (Ex)** Giant crabs can survive out of the water for 1 hour per point of Constitution. Beyond this limit, a giant crab runs the risk of suffocation, as if it were drowning.

Giant crabs behave much like their smaller cousins, feeding on both plant material like algae and fungus and animal matter such as fish, seabirds, and even unwary humanoids. The coloration of a giant crab's hard exoskeleton varies widely depending on species, and over time even shifts in response to its diet.

Other species of giant crab exist as well, some smaller but most quite a bit larger. You can adjust the stats given here by changing Hit Dice and size (changing Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution as appropriate) to represent a wide range of different species of giant crab. The following table lists the most common variants.

| Species | CR | Size | HD |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| King crab | 1/4 | Tiny | 1d8 |
| Coconut crab | 1/2 | Small | 1d8 |
| Rock crab | 4 | Large | 5d8 |
| Shark-eating crab | 7 | Huge | 8d8 |
| Great reef crab | 10 | Gargantuan | 11d8 |
| Shipwrecker crab | 13 | Colossal | 14d8 |

Crab swarms contain over a thousand normal-sized crabs that rush over their victims, plucking flesh with thousands of pinching claws. Some fishermen claim tides and phases of the moon cause these creatures to swarm as they do.
