**Special Abilities**

**Self-Resurrection (Su)** A slain phoenix remains dead for only 1d4 rounds unless its body is completely destroyed by an effect such as _ [disintegrate](../spells/disintegrate.md#_disintegrate)_. Otherwise, a fully healed phoenix emerges from the remains 1d4 rounds after death, as if brought back to life via _ [resurrection](../spells/resurrection.md#_resurrection)_. The phoenix gains 1 permanent negative level when this occurs, although most use _ [greater restoration](../spells/restoration.md#_restoration-greater)_ to remove this negative level as soon as possible. A phoenix can self-resurrect only once per year. If a phoenix dies a second time before that year passes, its death is permanent. A phoenix that dies within the area of a _ [desecrate](../spells/desecrate.md#_desecrate)_ spell cannot self-resurrect until the _ [desecrate](../spells/desecrate.md#_desecrate)_ effect ends, at which point the phoenix immediately resurrects. A phoenix brought back to life by other means never gains negative levels as a result.

**Shroud of Flame (Su)** A phoenix can cause its feathers to burst into fire as a free action. As long as its feathers are burning, it inflicts an additional 1d6 points of fire damage with each natural attack, and any creature within reach (20 feet for most phoenixes) must make a DC 25 Reflex save each round to avoid taking 4d6 points of fire damage at the start of its turn. A creature that attacks the phoenix with natural or non-reach melee weapons takes 1d6 points of fire damage (no save) with each successful hit. The save DC is Constitution-based.

The phoenix is a legendary bird of fire that dwells in the most remote parts of the desert. As the birds are known to be great scholars, many seekers of rare lore search out particular phoenixes for advice. Yet it is the phoenix's ability to rebirth itself from its own dead body for which the creature is best known.

The phoenix is a benevolent creature, aiding those who do good and actively harming those who do evil.
