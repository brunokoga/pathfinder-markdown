If the target is bound, grappled, or otherwise restrained, he may make an [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) check to escape as an immediate action. He gains a competence bonus on this check equal to twice your caster level (maximum +20). This spell has no effect if the target could not get free by using the [Escape Artist](skills/escapeArtist#_escape-artist) skill (for example, if he were under the effects of a _ [hold person](spells/holdPerson#_hold-person)_ spell or paralyzed by Strength damage).
