This spell makes the ammunition in the target firearm is prone to misfire. Increase the misfire range by 1 + 1 per five caster levels (maximum +5) for the ammunition currently loaded into that firearm. If aware of this spell's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 17 [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft.md#_spellcraft) check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.
