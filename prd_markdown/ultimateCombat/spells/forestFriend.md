While subject to this spell, the targets find that forested areas become helpful instead of hindering. The targets suffer no hindrances to movement and suffer no penalties on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) and [Stealth](skills/stealth#_stealth) checks from undergrowth in forested terrain. Furthermore, forested overgrowth imposes a miss chance 10% lower than normal.

When moving in and among trees, those subject to the spell gain a +5 circumstance bonus on [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) checks and [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks. Rangers in their favored terrain can also add their favored terrain bonus on such [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics#_acrobatics) and [Climb](skills/climb#_climb) checks.
