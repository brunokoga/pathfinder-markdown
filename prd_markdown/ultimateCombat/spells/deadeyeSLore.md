While subject to this spell, you take upon yourself the mantle of the hunter, channeling the insights of the spirits of the wild. You gain a +4 sacred bonus on all [Survival](skills/survival#_survival) checks for the duration of the spell, and you do not have to move at half your speed while traveling through the wilderness or while tracking.
