_Air bubble_ creates a small pocket of breathable air that surrounds the touched creature's head or the touched object. The _air bubble_ allows the creature touched to breathe underwater or in similar airless environments, or protects the object touched from water damage.

A firearm within an _air bubble_ can be loaded—assuming the black powder comes from a powder horn, a cartridge, or some other airtight protective device—and fired. When shooting such a firearm underwater, the shot still takes the standard –2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to normal penalties due to range. If a firearm within the _air bubble_ explodes, the explosion occurs normally.
