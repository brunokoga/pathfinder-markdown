Ammunition in the target firearm generates less of an explosive charge when fired. With such ammunition, the firearm's range increment is halved and the firer takes a –2 penalty on damage rolls. If aware of this spell's effect prior to firing the altered ammunition (a DC 16 [Spellcraft](skills/spellcraft#_spellcraft) check to identify the spell being cast or similar effect), the firearm's user can spend a standard action to clear the altered ammunition from the firearm. Doing so destroys that ammunition.
