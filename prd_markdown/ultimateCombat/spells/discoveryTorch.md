An object you touch emanates a 20-foot radius of bright light. The effect looks like a regular flame but creates no heat and uses no oxygen. Allies within the area of this light gain a +2 enhancement bonus on [Perception](skills/perception#_perception) and [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive#_sense-motive) checks, as well as on [Knowledge](skills/knowledge#_knowledge) checks to identify monsters that are also within the area and their special powers and vulnerabilities.

When an inquisitor casts this spell, the light emanation doubles (40-ft.-radius emanation) while that inquisitor has a judgment active.

Light spells counter and dispel darkness spells of an equal or lower level.
