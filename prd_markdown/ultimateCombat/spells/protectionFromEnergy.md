**Target** creatures touched

This spell functions like _ [protection from energy](spells/protectionFromEnergy#_protection-from-energy)_, except you divide the duration in 10-minute intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 12 points of energy damage per caster level (maximum 120 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.
