Hostile Levitation

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (a leather loop studded with lodestones)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one creature

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Will negates; **Spell Resistance** yes

You levitate the target a few inches off the ground, removing solid footing and halving the target's speed. The target also takes a –4 penalty to CMD against bull rush, drag, and reposition attempts. A targeted creature that attacks with a melee or ranged weapon finds itself increasingly unstable; the first attack has a –1 penalty on attack rolls, the second –2, and so on, to a maximum penalty of –5. A full-round action spent stabilizing allows the creature to begin again at –1.

This spell fails if cast on a flying creature.
