Recoil Fire

**School** transmutation; **Level** sorcerer/wizard 2, witch 2

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Components** V, S, M (hoof shavings from a mule)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** 1 firearm

**Duration** instantaneous

**Saving Throw** Will negates (object); **Spell Resistance** yes (object)

The target firearm suddenly fires of its own volition, even if it is unloaded, generating a recoil so great that the wielder or carrier of the firearm must scramble to hold onto it and becomes flat-footed until the start of his next turn. If the wielder is already flat-footed, he is instead knocked prone. If the firearm was loaded, that ammunition is wasted.
