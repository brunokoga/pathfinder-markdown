Litany of Eloquence

**School** enchantment (charm) [language dependent, mind-affecting]; **Level** antipaladin 2, inquisitor 3, paladin 2

**Casting Time** 1 swift action

**Components** V, S, DF

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

Your litany is a fascinating diatribe of grace, causing your target to do nothing but listen. The target is fascinated.

While subject to this spell, the target cannot be the target of another spell that has the word "litany" in the title.
