Protection from Arrows, Communal

**Level** alchemist 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, summoner 3

**Target** creatures touched

This spell functions like _ [protection from arrows](spells/protectionFromArrows#_protection-from-arrows)_, except you divide the duration in 1-hour intervals among the creatures touched. Once the spell absorbs 10 points of damage per caster level (maximum 100 points) for a subject, the spell's effects end for that subject.
