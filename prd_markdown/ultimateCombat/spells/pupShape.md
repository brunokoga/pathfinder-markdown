Pup Shape

**School** transmutation (polymorph); **Level** druid 3, sorcerer/wizard 3, witch 3

**Casting Time** 1 standard action

**Component** V, S, M (a rag doll)

**Range** close (25 ft. + 5 ft./2 levels)

**Target** one [animal](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_animal) or [magical beast](monsters/creatureTypes.md#_magical-beast).

**Duration** 1 round/level

**Saving Throw** Fortitude negates (and Will special, see text); **Spell Resistance** yes

You transform the subject animal into a Small magical beast, creating a young magical version of itself for a short period of time. While in this form, the target has only 1 HD (maximum hit points), and the target takes a â€“4 penalty to Strength, Constitution, Intelligence and Wisdom (minimum 1). The creature also gains a +4 size bonus to Dexterity and a +2 natural bonus.

Any nonevil creature that attempts to attack a creature in this form must succeed at a Will saving throw (using the DC of the spell) to overcome feelings of guilt and protectiveness toward the young and innocent-seeming creature. On a failed saving throw, it cannot follow through with the attack, that part of the action is lost, and it can't directly attack the transformed creature for the duration of the spell or until the spell's target attacks it. This part of the spell is a mind-affecting effect. Evil creatures have no qualms about attacking the target of this spell, in fact, some particularly heinous creatures might go out of their ways to do the target harm.
