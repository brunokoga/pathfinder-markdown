# Feats

Feats represent special tricks or abilities a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his birth. They grant characters abilities that others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some feats specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most are available to anyone who meets the prerequisites. This section introduces two new types of feats—grit feats and style feats. Grit feats expand a gunslinger's ability to use grit and deeds, while style feats each grant a style of martial arts that can be used by monks and other characters who learn the style.

# Types of Feats

While most of the feats presented here are general and have no special rules governing them, some feats belong to a type or types of feats that feature special shared rules. The type or types a feat belongs to appear in parentheses after the feat name. This chapter features the following types of feats.

## Combat Feats

Fighters and gunslingers can select combat feats as bonus feats. Member of other classes can take these feats as long as they meet the prerequisites.

## Critical Feats

Critical feats modify the effects of a critical hit by inflicting an additional condition on the victim. Characters without the [Critical Mastery](feats.md#_critical-mastery) feat can only apply the effects of one critical feat to an individual critical hit. Characters with multiple critical feats can decide which feat to apply after confirming a critical hit.

## Grit Feats

Grit feats interact with the gunslinger's grit class ability or the grit granted by the Amateur Gunslinger feat, usually by adding to her set of deeds. Sometimes these feats increase the number of grit points a character has or how that character regains grit points. Gunslingers can take grit feats as bonus feats.

## Metamagic Feats

Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify their spells, granting the spells new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell. For complete rules on how to apply metamagic feats to spells.

## Performance Feats

Performance feats are used when you make a performance combat check, typically granting a special action that occurs when you make that check. Unless you have the Masterful Display feat, you can only apply the effect of one performance feat to each performance combat check you make.

## Style Feats

For centuries, great warriors have looked to nature and the multiverse to find inspiration in battle. Countless monastic and contemplative orders have crafted intricate unarmed fighting styles based on the deadliness and grace of natural and supernatural creatures. Although many such fighting techniques were created by secretive orders, they have since spread to practitioners the world over.

As a swift action, you can enter the stance employed by the fighting style a style feat embodies. Although you cannot use a style feat before combat begins, the style you are in persists until you spend a swift action to switch to a different combat style. You can use a feat that has a style feat as a prerequisite only while in the stance of the associated style. For example, if you have feats associated with Mantis Style and Tiger Style, you can use a swift action to adopt Tiger Style at the start of one turn, and then can use other feats that have Tiger Style as a prerequisite. By using another swift action at the start of your next turn, you could adopt Mantis Style and use other feats that have Mantis Style as a prerequisite.

The styles presented follow, along with specific feat paths—feats that complement each style.

**Boar Style** : A tribe of orcs who disdained the use of weapons originally developed this savage unarmed fighting style. They preferred to slaughter their enemies with their bare hands and teeth. Over the centuries, a variety of races have adopted the Boar Style, most notably goblinoids, ogres, and trolls. The objective of the Boar Style is to attack with as much viciousness and cruelty as possible in order to break enemy morale. Fanatical followers of the style use herbal and alchemical reagents to harden their nails and teeth, sometimes performing self-mutilating procedures that result in clawlike nails and sharpened teeth.  
_Feat Path_: Boar Style, Boar Ferocity, Boar Shred.

**Dragon Style** : Dragon style captures the overwhelming power, grace, and ferocity of dragons. Practitioners use acrobatic footwork and strong attacks to overwhelm foes.

**Janni Style** : This style, originating humbly from the folk traditions of disparate peoples, represents several similar unarmed fighting arts practiced around the world. Regardless of variations in technique, all practitioners have a fluid fighting stance that emphasizes rapid, powerful kicks. The style's constant motion and graceful footwork lead many to mistakenly view practitioners as highly skilled dancers, a misconception that has allowed the technique to be taught in secret, the hidden weapon of the downtrodden and the oppressed. Openly martial versions of this style lose some of the dancelike qualities but retain the style's extraordinary kicking techniques and agility.  
_Feat Path_: Janni Style, Janni Tempest, Janni Rush.

  
  

**Kirin Style** : The school of the kirin employs critical observations as weapons against opponents.

_Feat Path_: Mantis Style, Mantis Wisdom, Mantis Torment.

  
  

**Marid Style** : Marid style emulates the fluid strength of flowing rivers and the cold of the ocean depths. Masters of the style can withstand severe cold, manipulate water to lash at enemies from afar, and freeze their foes in place.  
_Feat Path_: Marid Style, Marid Spirit, Marid Coldsnap.

_Feat Path_: Snake Style, Snake Sidewinder, Snake Fang.

  
  

**Snapping Turtle Style** : The snapping turtle style emphasizes active defense with one hand. Students of the style utilize a variety of locks, grabs, and circular blocks to protect themselves, as well as employing a debilitating clutch.

## Teamwork Feats

Teamwork grant significant bonuses but only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally with the same feat to have a specific position on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats. Inquisitors and cavaliers have special class abilities that allow them to use teamwork feats even when their allies do not have the feats.

# Feat Descriptions

All the feat descriptions in this chapter utilize the following format.

**Feat Name** : At the top of the feat entry, you will find the feat's name followed by parentheses listing any type or types the feat belongs to. A basic description of what the feat does appears under the name of the feat and its types, if any.

**Prerequisites** : This line lists any minimum ability scores, class features, feats, minimum base attack bonus, minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or other requirements for a character to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have multiple prerequisites. See the feat descriptions for full details.

**Benefit** : The benefit is what a feat enables a character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated in the feat's Special line.

**Normal** : This line indicates what a character without this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.

**Special** : This line lists special features of the feat, such as, but not limited to, whether or not you can take the feat more than once, or whether the feat allows members of specific classes to gain additional benefits.

## Adder Strike (Combat)

You can quickly apply poison to gloved hands, protected feet, or other protected body parts, delivering the poison with your unarmed strikes.

**Prerequisites** : Poison use class feature, [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) (alchemy) 1 rank, [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike).

**Benefit** : As a swift action, you can apply one dose of contact or injury poison to two body parts that you use for unarmed strikes. You must still protect yourself against exposure to contact poisons you apply in this way.

**Normal** : Applying poison to a weapon or single piece of ammunition is a standard action.

## Adept Champion

You can alter your smite ability, channeling the power of your deity into divine inspiration that grants you greater aptitude for performing combat maneuvers.

**Prerequisites** : Smite evil class feature, base attack bonus +5.

**Benefit** : While using your smite evil class feature, as a swift action at the start of your turn, you can forgo the bonus on damage rolls and instead gain half that bonus as a bonus on combat maneuver checks against the target of your smite. The effects of your smite evil feature return to normal at the start of your next turn.

## Amateur Gunslinger (Combat)

Although you are not a gunslinger, you have and can use grit.

**Prerequisite** : You have no levels in a class that has the grit class feature.

**Benefit** : You gain a small amount of grit and the ability to perform a single 1st-level deed from the gunslinger deed class feature. At the start of the day, you gain 1 grit point, though throughout the day you can gain grit points up to a maximum of your Wisdom modifier (minimum 1). You can regain grit using the rules for the gunslinger's grit class feature (see page 9). You can spend this grit to perform the 1st-level deed you chose upon taking this feat, and any other deed you have gained through feats or magic items.

**Special** : If you gain levels in a class that grants the grit class feature, you can immediately trade this feat for the Extra Grit feat.

## Arc Slinger (Combat)

**Prerequisites** : [Point-Blank Shot](feats.md#_point-blank-shot), proficient with sling or halfling sling staff.

If the target survives, it takes a –2 penalty on its initiative check for this combat.

Once you attack a creature, its attitude becomes hostile.

If you succeed, you have pinned your opponent and hold the opponent in a chokehold. When you maintain the grapple, you also maintain the chokehold. A creature in a chokehold cannot breathe or speak, and thus cannot cast spells that have a verbal component. An opponent you have in a chokehold has to hold his breath or begin suffocating.

## Combat Medic (Teamwork)

You know the urgency of treating wounds in the heat of battle, applying first aid to your allies with such speed that you assure no one gets left behind.

This repository contains the same number and type of dice as normal for your channel energy feature, and it lasts for 1 minute. An ally who has such a repository can use an immediate action to roll the repository's dice and regain a number of hit points equal to the result. If an ally who has such a repository is reduced to negative hit points, the repository triggers, allowing the ally to heal without using an action.

**Special** : An alchemist who has the delayed bomb alchemist discovery can use this feat to hand an enemy a delayed bomb. Such a delayed bomb detonates at the end of the alchemist's turn.

**Prerequisites** : Domain class feature, [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike).

**Benefit** : When you gain this feat, choose one domain-granted power that you can use to affect no more than one opponent.

**Special** : Taking this feat allows you to qualify for the [Elemental Fist](advanced/advancedFeats.md#_elemental-fist) feat (_Advanced Player's Guide_ 158) even if you do not meet that feat's prerequisites. If you do not meet that feat's prerequisites, you must choose one of the damage types that feat offers, and you can use only that damage type with your [Elemental Fist](advanced/advancedFeats.md#_elemental-fist) attacks until you meet the feat's normal prerequisites.

If you spend a day, the item regains 1 hit point plus one-quarter of its original hit points. Alternatively, if the item gained the broken condition because it is a firearm that has misfired or a siege engine that suffered a mishap, or has the broken condition because it has the fragile weapon quality (or some similar quality), you can make a [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) check with the DC it takes to craft that item (see Table 2–2, below).

You empower your weapon with the might of your deity, which you discharge as you strike your foes.

**Prerequisites** : Channel energy class feature, [Channel Smite](feats.md#_channel-smite), base attack bonus +8.

Prior to making each melee attack, allocate dice from the pool to be used as extra damage dice if you hit. Your target can make a Will save, as normal, to halve this extra damage. This extra damage is not multiplied when you score a critical hit. If you miss, the extra damage dice remain in your pool, but any dice left unexpended at the end of your turn are wasted.

_Damage_: When dealing damage to your grappled opponent, you deal your whip's weapon damage rather than your unarmed strike damage.

_Free Hands_: You take no penalty on your combat maneuver check for having fewer than two hands free when you use your whip to grapple.

_Reach_: Rather than pulling your grappled opponent adjacent to you when you successfully grapple and when you move the grapple, you must keep him within your whip's reach minus his own reach to maintain the grapple. If the difference in reach is less than 0, such as is the case for a Medium whip wielder and a Gargantuan creature, you cannot grapple that opponent with your whip. If you have to pull a creature adjacent to you to grapple it with your whip, you still provoke an attack of opportunity from that opponent unless you have the [Improved Grapple](feats.md#_improved-grapple) feat.

_Tie Up_: While adjacent to your opponent, you can attempt to use your whip to tie him up. If you do so to an opponent you have grappled rather than pinned, you take only a –5 penalty on the combat maneuver check rather than the normal –10.

**Prerequisites** : Channel energy class feature, [Channel Smite](feats.md#_channel-smite), proficiency with your deity's favored weapon.

_Crafting Firearms_: You can craft any early firearm for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. At your GM's discretion, you can craft advanced firearms for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the firearm. Crafting a firearm in this way takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of the firearm's price (minimum 1 day).

_Crafting Ammunition_: You can craft bullets, pellets, and black powder for a cost in raw materials equal to 10% of the price. If you have at least 1 rank in [Craft](skills/craft.md#_craft) (alchemy), you can craft alchemical cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half the price of the cartridge. At your GM's discretion, you can craft metal cartridges for a cost in raw materials equal to half the cost of the cartridge. Crafting bullets, black powder, or cartridges takes 1 day of work for every 1,000 gp of ammunition (minimum 1 day).

_Self-Harmonize:_ By performing over the acoustic reverberations of your performance, you increase the DC of your bardic performance effects +1.

_Reverberation:_ You can choose to have the effect of your current bardic performance continue for 1 round after you cease maintaining it, regardless of why you cease maintaining it. You can still have no more than one bardic performance in effect at one time.

You take a –4 penalty on your [Bluff](skills/bluff.md#_bluff) check when using Rhetorical Flourish in this way.
