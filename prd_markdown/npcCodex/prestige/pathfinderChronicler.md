Often lost in their own thoughts, sometimes these scholars forget others are around them. They're usually solitary, but have to go out exploring in search of information—or pay adventurers to retell their stories.

### Denarath Lithernorn

Given a choice, Denarath would rather avoid people and be left alone with the company of books. They give their opinions and observations directly and without deceit or the vagaries of tone, and never talk back when she disagrees with their opinions. Unfortunately for Denarath, chronicles are by definition the stories of other people and their deeds, so she needs to deal with other people for her work. She puts up with them with a quiet and detached reserve, waiting for them to perform deeds worthy of being immortalized in her prose. She takes an equal interest in all types of martial and magical prowess, and encourages allies to invite new, different members into their group.

**Combat Encounters:** During battle, Denarath sheepishly hovers behind the other combatants and gives her support with stoic detachment. After a battle, she searches the bodies for any maps, scrolls, or books that might be good sources of information. After that, she immediately pulls out a book and quill to write down an account of the high points of the battle.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Denarath is extremely quiet and withdrawn. Her face betrays little emotion, and she speaks only in brief, concise sentences. Tending to take things too literally, she often scoffs at common figures of speech. She can be a hassle to travel with, since she packs a giant trunk of books for even the shortest journey. She reads late into the night, and refuses to leave until she's had time to pick up the tomes she's left scattered around.

### Ygulda Goldenbrow

At a young age, Ygulda fell in love with ancient ballads and odes, and now she considers herself a living valkyrie. She aids any warriors she believes carry the true spark of heroism, hoping they will serve as muses for future songs in which she can immortalize their great deeds.

**Combat Encounters:** Ygulda travels with a cadre of heroic warriors, mostly barbarians. She tells them that it's better to die a glorious death in battle than to survive through cowardice.
