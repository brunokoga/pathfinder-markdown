Like gnawing nightmares dwelling in shadow, blackstrikes stalk just out of sight, yet still close enough to strike.

### Kresis Helgold

Nothing more than a murderer for hire, Kresis will take nearly any job if the money is right. Possessing no loyalty to any one group, she rarely accepts jobs from the same people twice, and has been known to carry out assassinations for both sides of a single conflict. Sometimes, this means an aggravated employer sends assassins after Kresis herself. In these situations, she retreats rather than staying to fight—unless she knows one of her would-be killers has a high price on his head that she could claim.

Though she almost always takes jobs she's offered, Kresis draws the line at murdering children and people she considers innocents. In times of doubt, she leaves the fate of her prey to a simple coin toss. If the result favors the victim, she doesn't accept the money she was promised for the job, and leaves it at that. If her employer hires another assassin, it's no longer her problem.

**Combat Encounters:** Kresis does not kill for fun; she kills for pay. It's not her job to collect information, to help out other mercenaries, or to deliver messages—just to kill her target and get paid. She takes as few personal risks as possible, and makes sure she's prepared before a battle so she can fight on her own terms. Once a mercenary, she turned to assassination in order to have more control over her actions and lower her own risk of death, and she's not about to stick her neck out now. She almost never fights in the middle of the day, preferring to attack at night or near dusk or dawn when the shadows are long.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Sullen and withdrawn, Kresis says little about herself, and seems distracted by her own thoughts. She is actually an attentive listener, though, and rarely forgets what she hears. She eavesdrops on tavern conversations to get information about her targets before the kill. She couldn't care less about the fallout after the hit—as long as she gets the money she was promised, she considers the venture a success.

### Mellak the Raven

Mellak sees life as a dance and death as its finale. A performer at heart, he makes each death he deals an act in his play of mortality, often using a dancing flourish to make it as artistic as possible. He expounds upon his philosophy of a beautiful death to his victims, explaining that they are lucky to receive an elegant death rather than the ugly end of sickness and infirmity.

### Scal Wistalvak

Gnomes love pranks and practical jokes, but few are as dark, devious, and deadly as those of Scal Wistalvak. The entire time he uses illusions and ice magic to bring about psychological torture and chilling death, he stays out of sight, laughing maniacally.

Short but deadly, a darkstar skirts the shadows with his shadow companion.

### Filagan Umbraflame

A thief and a liar, Filagan is more interested in filling his coin purse and enjoying the good life than he is in carnage or murder. Though deadly in combat, he avoids it whenever possible. He employs dirty tricks when cornered, knowing his small size is a disadvantage in a straight physical fight. Once he gets the best of his opponent, he escapes to a nearby tavern or gambling hall to lose himself in the crowd and relax.

**Combat Encounters:** A daring thief, Filagan knows adventurers are typically lucrative marks. This often causes him to take too big of risks and get himself into trouble stealing from them. Filagan rarely travels with allies, but might jump into a larger battle if doing so means there's less risk to him personally.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Jovial and fun-loving, Filagan is the life of the party, buying drinks and telling good-natured and self-deprecating jokes. He doesn't let on that he's an experienced killer—at least not until someone threatens one of his drinking buddies.
