Most evil temples and cults use sacred killers to enforce their twisted will or to eliminate annoying enemies.

### Dulg Goldeneyes

When living on the streets as a young orphan, Dulg was abducted by a cult of the god of murder, who originally planned on using him as a test subject for new poisons they were creating. Intrigued by the young half-orc's spirit, resilience, and intelligence, however, the cult decided to cultivate him instead. They groomed him as an unholy assassin, and the half-orc has been an unquestioning killer for the cult ever since. Truly enjoying his murderous trade, Dulg leaves a grim calling card with each kill. Once his victim is dead, Dulg gouges out the eyes and leaves two polished golden coins in the sockets.

**Combat Encounters:** If Dulg comes calling, it typically means his marks have somehow crossed his cult, but this is not always the case. Sometimes he murders just to hone his craft and increase his grim renown.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Often silent and sullen, Dulg tends to see people only as potential targets of his foul art. He takes few freelance assignments, doing so only if he believes it can enhance his already fearsome reputation.

These monks deal swift and dispassionate death to those who threaten or cross their monastery.

### Kel Sal Koth

Little is know about Kel Sal Koth's background or origins, even to her. Her first memories involve the monastery's early lessons about the deadly discipline she was chosen to follow. Kel's philosophy is simple, but her commitment to it is deep. She believes that only in suppressing emotion can one find true harmony with the universe—and the true test of such suppression is dispassionately taking other intelligent creatures' lives.

**Combat Encounters:** Kel prefers to work alone, but if a target is too strong, she handpicks other members of her monastery to cause diversions or run interference.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** To call Kel unfeeling is an understatement. She only apes emotion as a ploy to get closer to her prey.

**During Combat** In animal form, the assassin studies an enemy spellcaster for 3 rounds before casting _ [obscuring mist](/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/obscuringMist.html#_obscuring-mist)_ to sow chaos among his foes. He then takes his real form to make a death attack against his target. In melee, he trips his foes.

Many of these murderers serve as assassins for dark druid circles or dominate savage humanoid tribes.

### Zelath the Reaper

Knowing that death is just part of the cycle of life, Zelath truly believes his murderous ways enforces the will of nature. Like a deadly gardener, he prunes those who dare thwart death's call or despoil nature.

**Combat Encounters:** Zelath aids other druids in the protection of their homes, bringing his unorthodox talents for mutual defense and strategic offense.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Zelath often offers his expert knowledge of poisons to friends of the natural order.

**During Combat** Using her fast stealth and _ [boots of speed](/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_boots-of-speed)_ to rush into the fray, the assassin attacks the most threatening target using bleeding strike. Next, she moves out of melee to soften foes with throwing axe attacks before reentering melee.

Surprisingly quick and nimble for dwarves, fatal axes mix melee prowess with devastating throwing axe strikes to bring down their foes.

### Thelan Stonebiter

In Thelan's mind, the task she performs serves the greater good of her clan and her fortress home. The dwarven people have many foes, from savage giants to sociopathic goblins to those capricious and deceptive elves. Her work, though unconventional, deceptive, and contrary to most dwarves' sense of honor and fair play, is essential in evening the odds. Not entirely without honor, she refuses to use her murderous art against fellow dwarves.

**Combat Encounters:** Though Thelan sometimes takes freelance assignments against non-dwarven targets, her true passion is protecting her people.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** When not on a mission, Thelan acts like a normal dwarf. She is loyal to friends, her clan, and the thanes of her fortress. Few who know her suspect her of dark deeds.
