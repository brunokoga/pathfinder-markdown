An acolyte has just begun to unravel the mysteries of her faith, and lacks the fervent zeal that more indoctrinated members of her religion have. She is eager to learn, but her incomplete teachings mean she is more easily swayed by contrary rhetoric.

Settlements that have adepts rather than clerics are often primitive or remote. Their religious practices may be a strange or heretical offshoot of a main religion, weaker than the common form but giving access to spells that are normally unavailable to true clerics (such as _ [minor creation](spells/minorCreation.md#_minor-creation)_ and _ [sleep](spells/sleep.md#_sleep)_). A person trained by a cleric who instead manifests adept abilities may be cast out as a blasphemer or witch.

A shaman serves a small tribe as a visionary and source of wisdom—the sole authority on supernatural matters, and the only one who can communicate with the worlds beyond. His familiar may be a representation of his spirit animal or a spy who allows him to learn more about other tribesfolk and appear wiser than he is.

This stat block can also be used as a lesser adept apprenticed to an initiate (adept 3), doom prophet (adept 4), or guru (adept 6).

This wise woman knows many natural remedies for wounds and ailments, and supports this knowledge with a strange mix of spells, scrolls, and potions. She is midwife to many women, assists in the delivery of livestock, and is trusted for her ability to predict storms and droughts. The healer has a kind heart and hates to see any creature suffer. She is usually able to find alternative ways for poor folk to pay for her services, and as a result is beloved by her community. Once she is provided with sufficient food, water, and household supplies for her needs, she often directs payments above and beyond that to other needy people in the vicinity, creating a web of trust and reliance among the townsfolk or villagers.

If she helps adventurers with a curse, disease, or terrible injury, she is likely to ask them to build a stone wall, repair a house, or tend to a farmer's livestock in payment. This is the case even if there is a remote threat of monsters nearby, for she understands that the adventurers were likely to chase down that threat anyway, and therefore would be getting a service for free. She believes in generosity and altruism, but likes it when people remain humble and are willing to get their hands dirty doing "real work" that lacks the "glory" of bloodshed.

Many of her supplies were acquired from years of negotiating and trading, whether directly for the items (such as her _wand of [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_) or for rare or exotic materials she can use to make potions and scrolls. If adventurers wish to pay her in the form of these goods (or by questing for them) or offer her minor healing items the adventurers have outgrown but that would still be useful for helping villagers, she gratefully accepts.

The healer is especially interested in acquiring _potions of [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_, as she is not particularly fast on her feet (and is getting slower as the years pass), nor is she a skilled rider, so being able to hand a healing potion (which even a non-spellcaster can administer) to a fast rider or runner might make the difference between life and death for an injured farmer or rancher.

The cultist is a smiling friend to all in her community, so few suspect she leads a second life dedicated to ushering in the apocalypse. The cultist spins falsehoods to conceal her true motives, presenting herself as a pious woman of the church, a research assistant for a sage, or the demure wife of the mayor or a local merchant—any role where she can be known but does not wield power, and is therefore not suspected of having any ambition. She uses her magic to spy on townsfolk, punish her enemies and those who would thwart her plans, direct suspicion away from her onto a scapegoat, and sow confusion and panic among the townsfolk so she can manipulate them more easily. If discovered using magic, she pretends to be less successful at it than she truly is and asks the witnesses not to tell her superiors of it, as they would disapprove and punish her for it.

Whether she serves demons, the god of destruction, or strange beings from the outer darkness, the cultist eagerly anticipates the ruin of the world. Much of her work involves placing secret marks around her village, sacrificing animals, burning strange herbs, and uttering guttural chants, all of which help power the apocalypse ritual taught to her by her dark masters. The culmination of these acts almost certainly requires human sacrifice—whether a direct act with a knife or a subtle massacre such as a burning building—and perhaps a celestial conjunction between stars and planets invisible to the naked eye.

The cultist may believe the masters of the apocalypse will reward her with power or divinity when the time comes, or will grant her a quick and merciful death. She may wish to see the world burn for some slight against her by a rival or lover, or simply because the secret madness within her throbs at the idea of such wanton destruction.

Her minions in town include secret alliances with enforcers (adepts 5), ruffians (commoners 7), or even a traitor (commoner 10). The members of this conspiracy may not know each other's identities, or may believe that someone other than the cultist is in charge.
