Filled with bluster and swagger, a recruit lacks the discipline of an experienced soldier and can quickly lose resolve if he finds himself in over his head. A recruit works best in a large group under a strong leader who can keep all the soldiers in line and working together.

Left to his own devices, a recruit becomes bored and looks for entertainments such as drinking and gambling to pass the time.

Brigand CR 1/2

**XP** 200

**Human warrior** 2

NE Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** +1; **Senses** Perception +0

Defense

**Fort** +4, **Ref** +1, **Will** +0

Offense

**Speed** 30 ft.

**Melee** longsword +3 (1d8+1/19–20) or sap +3 (1d6+1 nonlethal)

**Ranged** longbow +3 (1d8/×3)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior snipes with arrows until her foes are close, then uses her sword. She hurls thunderstones at spellcasters, and tanglefoot bags at foes wearing heavy armor.

Statistics

**Str** 13, **Dex** 13, **Con** 12, **Int** 9, **Wis** 10, **Cha** 8

**Base Atk** +2; **CMB** +3; **CMD** 14

A brigand has no sense of mercy, and is happy to kill for a handful of silver. Brigands waylay caravans, create illegal turnpikes on roads to collect tolls from travelers, attack noisy camps at night, and harass villages for protection money. They are easily routed but carry a grudge and remain a recurring problem until imprisoned or killed.

Many brigands are former soldiers who lacked the discipline to stay in the military or a mercenary company, and may even be deserters from a local or invading army. They rarely use group tactics, and form into gangs under the toughest member of the group, typically a grizzled mercenary (warrior 6).

Guard CR 1

**XP** 400

**Human warrior** 3

LN Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** –1; **Senses** Perception +5

Defense

**AC** 13, touch 9, flat-footed 13 (+4 armor, –1 Dex)

**hp** 22 (3d10+6)

**Fort** +3, **Ref** +0, **Will** +2

Offense

**Speed** 30 ft.

**Melee** mwk guisarme +7 (2d4+3/×3) or mwk longsword +6 (1d8+2/19–20)

**Ranged** javelin +2 (1d6+2)

**Space** 5 ft.; **Reach** 5 ft. (10 ft. with guisarme)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior uses his reach to trip foes as they close, and switches to his sword if necessary.

Statistics

**Str** 15, **Dex** 9, **Con** 10, **Int** 8, **Wis** 12, **Cha** 11

**Base Atk** +3; **CMB** +5; **CMD** 14

**Feats** [Alertness](feats.md#_alertness), [Toughness](feats.md#_toughness), [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) (guisarme)

**Skills** [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +6, Perception +5, [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) +4

**Languages** Common

**Gear** chain shirt, javelins (3), masterwork guisarme, masterwork longsword, manacles, 36 gp

A guard's job is to protect others and respond to trouble. Whether sentries in a fort, members of a city or town watch, caravan guards, or bodyguards for a nervous merchant, guards are trained to look for intruders or suspicious activity and respond with steel if violence is necessary. Most operate in pairs or larger groups, allowing one to run for help if the group is outmatched.

The above stat block represents a professional guard or soldier who has seen many battles (unlike guards, soldiers do not generally carry manacles). Their armor and weapons may belong to their employer (or the army), but career guards buy high-quality armor and weapons of their own, making sure to retain enough mobility to chase down attackers. To create a lower-ranking officer, apply the advanced creature simple template to this stat block.

Veteran Buccaneer CR 2

**XP** 600

**Human warrior** 4

CE Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** +3; **Senses** Perception –1

Defense

**AC** 17, touch 14, flat-footed 13 (+3 armor, +3 Dex, +1 dodge)

**hp** 26 (4d10+4)

**Fort** +4, **Ref** +4, **Will** +0

Offense

**Speed** 30 ft.

**Melee** mwk scimitar +6 (1d6+1/18–20)

**Ranged** mwk heavy crossbow +8 (1d10/19–20) or throwing axe +7 (1d6+1)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior uses her crossbow until she is in boarding range, then switches to her scimitar.

Statistics

**Str** 12, **Dex** 16, **Con** 11, **Int** 10, **Wis** 8, **Cha** 9

**Base Atk** +4; **CMB** +5; **CMD** 19

**Feats** [Dodge](feats.md#_dodge), Mobility, [Toughness](feats.md#_toughness)

**Skills** [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) +6, [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) +6, [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +6, [Profession](skills/profession.md#_profession) (sailor) +3, [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) +17

**Languages** Common, Orc

**Combat Gear** _ [elixir of swimming](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_elixir-of-swimming)_, _potion of [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_, _potions of [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_ (2), _potion of [jump](spells/jump.md#_jump),_ alchemist's fire; **Other Gear** studded leather, masterwork heavy crossbow with 10 bolts, masterwork scimitar, throwing axe, 231 gp

A veteran buccaneer lives to murder and plunder. Like a shark, she constantly hunts for prey. Buccaneers prefer easy targets like heavy, slow-moving merchant ships that quickly surrender their booty rather than fast military vessels that at best have a stockpile of weapons and at worst carry a full crew of angry sailors itching to spill pirate blood. Some buccaneers take only cargo, some take slaves, and some leave no survivors.

Larger pirate vessels may have slave rowers (use the old sailor stat block, expert 2) who are prodded to the decks as reluctant fighters and living shields for the actual buccaneers; these slaves are easily replaced from surviving members of the opposing crew. A typical pirate captain uses the grizzled mercenary stat block (warrior 6) or has a PC class like the pirate king (fighter 15), pirate queen (ranger 10), or sea captain (druid 8).

Tavern Champion CR 3

**XP** 800

**Half-orc warrior** 5

N Medium humanoid (human, orc)

**Init** +1; **Senses** darkvision 60 ft.; Perception +0

Defense

**AC** 16, touch 11, flat-footed 15 (+4 armor, +1 Dex, +1 natural)

**hp** 37 (5d10+10)

**Fort** +5, **Ref** +2, **Will** +0

**Defensive Abilities** orc ferocity

Offense

**Speed** 30 ft.

**Melee** unarmed strike +7 (1d3+2) or sap +7 (1d6+2 nonlethal) or warhammer +7 (1d8+3/×3)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior makes nonlethal unarmed strikes unless an opponent draws a weapon. She uses Improved Bull Rush to throw opponents into tables or through windows. If sorely pressed, she drinks her _potion of [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson.md#_enlarge-person)_.

Statistics

**Str** 14, **Dex** 13, **Con** 12, **Int** 9, **Wis** 8, **Cha** 10

**Base Atk** +5; **CMB** +7; **CMD** 18

**Feats** [Combat Reflexes](feats.md#_combat-reflexes), Improved Bull Rush, [Improved Unarmed Strike](feats.md#_improved-unarmed-strike)

**Skills** [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +9, Perception +0

**Languages** Common, Orc

**SQ** orc blood, weapon familiarity

**Combat Gear** _potions of [cure light wounds](spells/cureLightWounds.md#_cure-light-wounds)_ (2), _potion of [enlarge person](spells/enlargePerson.md#_enlarge-person)_; **Other Gear** chain shirt, sap, warhammer, _ [amulet of natural armor](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_amulet-of-natural-armor) +1_, 137 gp

A tavern champion is locally famous for boxing, throwing darts, arm wrestling, or just coming out on top in a bar fight. If she's not in the mood to fight—for example, if she's just trying to enjoy a meal or drink with friends—she prefers to intimidate rivals into backing down, but still enjoys a good brawl and knocks out anyone who doesn't take no for an answer.

Besting the tavern champion in a contest of strength earns her respect and admiration (and often a friendly camaraderie) as long as her opponent has good sportsmanship and lets her keep her dignity in defeat. Humiliating her, on the other hand, could result in an ambush beating or acts against the victor's property or companion creatures.

Grizzled Mercenary CR 4

**XP** 1,200

**Human warrior** 6

CN Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** +0; **Senses** Perception +4

Defense

**AC** 18, touch 10, flat-footed 18 (+8 armor)

**hp** 51 (6d10+18)

**Fort** +7, **Ref** +3, **Will** +3

Offense

**Speed** 20 ft.

**Melee** mwk heavy flail +9/+4 (1d10+3/19–20) or mwk halberd +9/+4 (1d10+3/×3) or longspear +8/+3 (1d8+3/×3) or morningstar +8/+3 (1d8+2) or cold iron kukri +8/+3 (1d4+2/18–20)

**Ranged** javelin +6 (1d6+2)

**Space** 5 ft.; **Reach** 5 ft. (10 ft. with longspear)

Tactics

**During Combat** The mercenary throws a few javelins, then closes in for the kill.

Statistics

**Str** 14, **Dex** 10, **Con** 12, **Int** 9, **Wis** 11, **Cha** 8

**Base Atk** +6; **CMB** +8; **CMD** 18

**Feats** Diehard, [Endurance](feats.md#_endurance), [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack), [Toughness](feats.md#_toughness)

**Skills** [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) +0, [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal.md#_handle-animal) +3, [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +6, [Knowledge](skills/knowledge.md#_knowledge) (local) +0, Perception +4, [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) +0

**Languages** Common

**Combat Gear** _potion of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_, _potion of [cure moderate wounds](spells/cureModerateWounds.md#_cure-moderate-wounds),_ alchemist's fire (2), holy water; **Other Gear** masterwork half-plate, cold iron kukri, javelins (4), longspear, masterwork halberd, masterwork heavy flail, morningstar, _ [cloak of resistance](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_cloak-of-resistance) +1_, antitoxin, sunrod, 325 gp

A grizzled mercenary is armed to the teeth, and has survived wars and reckless adventurers. He carries multiple weapons so he can deal with various types of monstrous foes, and is unfazed by most encounters. He expects to be paid for his service on time and in real coin—not giant gems or weird statues.

The mercenary is willing to guard a keep, wear a warlord's tabard or uniform, or venture into the upper levels of a dungeon, but he's no fool and doesn't like being treated as expendable. He is loyal as long as he is paid well, but not willing to risk his life on an obvious suicide mission. The above stat block can also be used for veteran military officers.

Expert [Bodyguard](advanced/advancedFeats.md#bodyguard) CR 5

**XP** 1,600

**Human warrior** 7

N Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** +3; **Senses** Perception +8

Defense

**AC** 17, touch 9, flat-footed 17 (+7 armor, –1 Dex, +1 shield)

**hp** 59 (7d10+21)

**Fort** +7, **Ref** +1, **Will** +5

Offense

**Speed** 20 ft.

**Melee** _+1 longsword_ +10/+5 (1d8+2/19–20) or kukri +8/+3 (1d4+1/18–20)

**Ranged** mwk light crossbow +7 (1d8/19–20)

Tactics

**During Combat** If she sees an enemy approaching, the warrior fires her _ [screaming bolt](magicItems/weapons.md#_screaming-bolt)_ before entering melee. In melee, she uses Stand Still to prevent enemies from getting past her, giving her employer time to escape.

Statistics

**Str** 13, **Dex** 9, **Con** 14, **Int** 10, **Wis** 12, **Cha** 8

**Base Atk** +7; **CMB** +8; **CMD** 17

**Feats** [Combat Reflexes](feats.md#_combat-reflexes), [Improved Initiative](feats.md#_improved-initiative), [Iron Will](feats.md#_iron-will), Stand Still, [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) (longsword)

**Skills** [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +9, Perception +8, [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) +8

**Languages** Common

**Combat Gear** _potion of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_, _potion of [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_, _potion of [cure moderate wounds](spells/cureModerateWounds.md#_cure-moderate-wounds)_, _ [screaming bolt](magicItems/weapons.md#_screaming-bolt)_, tanglefoot bag (2); **Other Gear** masterwork banded mail, masterwork light steel shield, _+1 longsword_, kukri, masterwork light crossbow with 20 bolts, masterwork manacles, 114 gp

A bodyguard carries many scars from attempts on her employer's life. Unlike a common guard or even a grizzled old mercenary, she is willing to die to protect her charge if that is the only way to keep him safe. If given the option to sacrifice her own life to save him or flee to save herself, she'll choose the former.

A skilled bodyguard focuses her attention on her employer and any potential threats to his safety. She searches rooms before he enters, frisks unexpected guests for weapons, and may drive his chariot or employ common guards she trusts to do so.

Aloof Archer CR 6

**XP** 2,400

**Elf warrior** 8

CN Medium humanoid (elf)

**Init** +2; **Senses** low-light vision; Perception +10

Defense

**AC** 20, touch 11, flat-footed 19 (+9 armor, +1 Dex)

**hp** 52 (8d10+8)

**Fort** +6, **Ref** +4, **Will** +2; +2 vs. enchantments

**Immune** sleep

Offense

**Speed** 20 ft.

**Melee** elven curve blade +10/+5 (1d10+3/18–20)

**Ranged** _+1 composite longbow_ +12/+7 (1d8+3/×3)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior uses her _+1 [flaming](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming) arrows_ on dangerous targets like spellcasters. She falls backs and keeps firing as foes approach her, avoiding melee as long as possible.

Statistics

**Str** 14, **Dex** 14, **Con** 10, **Int** 10, **Wis** 10, **Cha** 9

**Base Atk** +8; **CMB** +10; **CMD** 22

**Feats** [Deadly Aim](feats.md#_deadly-aim), [Point-Blank Shot](feats.md#_point-blank-shot), Rapid Shot, [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) (composite longbow)

**Skills** Perception +10, [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) +5

**Languages** Common, Elven

**SQ** elven magic, weapon familiarity

**Combat Gear** _ [elixir of hiding](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_elixir-of-hiding)_, _+1 [flaming](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-flaming) arrows_ (6), _potion of [cure moderate wounds](spells/cureModerateWounds.md#_cure-moderate-wounds)_, _potion of [divine favor](spells/divineFavor.md#_divine-favor)_; **Other Gear** masterwork full plate, _+1 composite longbow_ (+2 Str) with 40 arrows, elven curve blade, 72 gp

An aloof archer is disdainful of the archery skill of non-elves. Despite their heavy armor, aloof archers are remarkably stealthy. Unlike the elven scouts who move through the brush and harass invaders, these archers make up the ranged support of elven armies, firing over their comrades' heads into the thick of enemy forces, creating a hail of deadly arrows.

Cavalry Soldier CR 7

**XP** 3,200

**Half-elf warrior** 9

LN Medium humanoid (elf, human)

**Init** +0; **Senses** low-light vision; Perception +8

Defense

**AC** 21, touch 10, flat-footed 21 (+9 armor, +2 shield)

**hp** 67 (9d10+18)

**Fort** +7, **Ref** +3, **Will** +4; +2 vs. enchantments

Offense

**Speed** 20 ft.

**Melee** _+1 lance_ +13/+8 (1d8+5/×3) or mwk heavy pick +13/+8 (1d6+3/×4)

**Ranged** mwk composite shortbow +10/+5 (1d6+3/×3)

**Space** 5 ft.; **Reach** 5 ft. (10 ft. with lance)

Tactics

**During Combat** The warrior shoots her bow at lightly armored opponents, using Mounted Archery to aim accurately even when moving at speed. In melee, she wields her lance against heavily armored targets, using Spirited Charge to increase her damage and Ride-By Attack to create openings in enemy defensive lines.

Statistics

**Str** 16, **Dex** 10, **Con** 12, **Int** 11, **Wis** 8, **Cha** 10

**Base Atk** +9; **CMB** +12; **CMD** 22

**Feats** [Iron Will](feats.md#_iron-will), Mounted Archery, [Mounted Combat](feats.md#_mounted-combat), Ride-By Attack, [Skill Focus](feats.md#_skill-focus) (Perception), Spirited Charge

**Skills** [Handle Animal](skills/handleAnimal.md#_handle-animal) +8, Perception +8, [Ride](skills/ride.md#_ride) +6

**Languages** Common, Elven

**SQ** elf blood

**Combat Gear** _potions of [cure moderate wounds](spells/cureModerateWounds.md#_cure-moderate-wounds)_ (2), _potion of [heroism](spells/heroism.md#_heroism)_, cold iron arrows (10), silver arrows (10); **Other Gear** masterwork full plate, masterwork heavy steel shield, _+1 lance_, masterwork composite shortbow (+3 Str) with 40 arrows, masterwork heavy pick, bit and bridle, heavy horse (combat trained), masterwork chainmail barding, military saddle, saddlebags, 259 gp

A cavalry soldier mixes the elven devotion to the natural world with a human's skill at armored combat. She devotes herself to a career in the military, the elven blood in her veins giving her the time and patience needed to reach the highest pay grade for a non-officer. She is content to remain at her current rank until she dies or retires, for she took this job because of her love of horses and battle. She respects discipline, and if she weren't in the army, she probably would form her own mercenary company just so she could train others in horsemanship, battle tactics, and skill-at-arms.

The soldier is blunt and direct but not intentionally rude. She understands and respects that each horse responds differently to verbal and nonverbal cues, and knows that people are the same way, but is easily annoyed by how humans say one thing and do another. She prefers interactions where she can give or take orders with no question as to what is expected of her and her fellows. Flowery words and flattery are tiresome to her, and her closest friends are those who speak to her openly and honestly, as she would to them. She enjoys the company of druids and rangers, appreciating their respect for animals and feeling only slight envy because of her inability to control the magic they wield.

The soldier has a keen eye for fine horses, and in times of peace she breeds and raises them, either on her own or for the army. She has retired many cavalry horses in her lifetime, finding ranches where they can be put to stud, tasked with light work, or used to train novice riders. She is disgusted by the idea of butchering horses for meat, would rather starve than eat a horse, and won't permit any in her company to do so. When a warhorse dies, she buries its heart and head with honor and burns the rest, unwilling to let a noble companion be eaten by scavengers. Seeing someone mistreat a horse drives her into a frenzy, and she has been known to tackle and beat a peasant or merchant she spots whipping a horse to get it to work. (She is wise enough to not do this to an officer or noble, but if by some inaction on her part that person dies in combat, so much the better.) She especially dislikes goblins for their cruelty toward horses, and enjoys skewering them on her lance, leaving the corpses on her lance for follow-up attacks to better intimidate their allies.

This stat block can also be used for an expert military archer, a non-noble general, or a road-weary veteran who has gone to war against hordes of orcs, goblins, or ogres.

Gladiator Champion CR 8

**XP** 4,800

**Human warrior** 10

NE Medium humanoid (human)

**Init** +3; **Senses** Perception +4

Defense

**AC** 19, touch 15, flat-footed 15 (+3 armor, +1 deflection, +3 Dex, +1 dodge, +1 shield)

**hp** 75 (10d10+20)

**Fort** +7, **Ref** +6, **Will** +2

Offense

**Speed** 30 ft.

**Melee** _+1 short sword _+12/+7 (1d8+3), mwk light mace +11 (1d6+1) or trident +12/+7 (1d8+3)

**Ranged** trident +13 (1d8+3) or dart +13 (1d4+2) or net +9 ranged touch (entangle)

Tactics

**During Combat** In a gladiator match, the warrior fights with dramatic showmanship, performing unnecessary acrobatic maneuvers, intimidating foes with flashy weapons displays (using Dazzling Display), and otherwise prolonging the fight. Depending on the style and theme of the match, he may go for blood with his sword and mace, hold the high ground with his trident, or capture and drag his opponent with the net. Outside the arena, he is quick and brutal with his attacks, wasting no time before killing his opponent so he is out of danger as soon as possible.

Statistics

**Str** 14, **Dex** 16, **Con** 10, **Int** 10, **Wis** 8, **Cha** 11

**Base Atk** +10; **CMB** +12; **CMD** 27

**Feats** Dazzling Display, [Dodge](feats.md#_dodge), [Toughness](feats.md#_toughness), Two-Weapon Defense, [Two-Weapon Fighting](feats.md#_two-weapon-fighting), [Weapon Focus](feats.md#_weapon-focus) (short sword)

**Skills** [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) +12, [Intimidate](skills/intimidate.md#_intimidate) +8, Perception +4, [Sense Motive](skills/senseMotive.md#_sense-motive) +9

**Languages** Common

**Combat Gear** _potion of [cure moderate wounds](spells/cureModerateWounds.md#_cure-moderate-wounds)_, _potion of [heroism](spells/heroism.md#_heroism)_; **Other Gear** studded leather, _+1 short sword_, darts (10), net, masterwork light mace, trident, _ [belt of giant strength](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_belt-of-giant-strength) +2_, _ [ring of protection](magicItems/rings.md#_ring-of-protection) +1_, antitoxin, 240 gp

The gladiator champion rose up from hopeless slavery to great fame, winning match after match with luck, skill, and the approval of the crowd. He has defeated single opponents and dozens of warriors at once, fought tigers and strange beasts, and even battled a minotaur and things that have no name in any human tongue.

Now at the top of his game, the champion fights every public battle as if a grand audience were watching. Though he is still a slave, he is a valued slave with thousands of fans, and his owner is careful to not put him in matches where he will likely be slain. The gladiator lives for the fighting, the glory, the wet heat of his opponent's blood, and the noise of the joyous crowd. Within the halls of the gladiators he lives like a prince, albeit a prince bound with a thin golden chain that he cannot break on his own.

In the arena he has played the role of mighty hero and god of war, but deep in his heart he knows his time of greatness will eventually come to an end. He hopes that someday his owner will grant him his freedom, allowing him to retire to a place of comfort where he can live off a small stipend—an honest reward for a lifetime of dangerous service. He fears that his master will discard him before he gets too old, throwing away his life in some grand spectacle or to win a bet against a rival's champion—a humiliating, pointless death for a seasoned performer.

The longer he remains a gladiator, the more this voice of fear speaks to him. He is a hero to the other slave gladiators, and enough fear may push him to lead them in an armed rebellion against their captors. Depending on the skill of his fellows, use the stat blocks for recruits (warriors 1), brigands (warriors 2), veteran buccaneers (warriors 4), or tavern champions (warriors 5). Having killed hundreds over the years just for the sake of entertainment, he is more than willing to sacrifice his comrades if doing so means he and the survivors have a chance to live out their last years in peace.

Above all, the gladiator wants to survive. If he is losing a fight—even a public one—and has reason to believe his opponent will be merciful, he surrenders rather than fighting to the death.

This stat block can also be used for a retired military hero, tribal champion, or loyal retainer of a noble family. If used for this purpose, change his melee weapon choices and his armor to alternatives that are more suitable for his revised role.
