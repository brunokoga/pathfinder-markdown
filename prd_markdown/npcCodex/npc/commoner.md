A ruffian makes a living by petty theft and robbery when he isn't working with a larger gang. Lacking the motivation to learn a profitable trade, a ruffian has spent a lifetime at hard unskilled labor, and isn't afraid to throw his weight around to get what he wants.

Ruffians are employed anywhere brute strength is more important than skill or finesse and getting it done cheaply is better than getting it done well. Miners use ruffians to push carts; farmers hire them to load wagons; merchants, thieves' guilds, and cults use them as enforcers and guards; and street gangs enlist them to bolster their numbers.

As a respected person in her community, an elder takes it upon herself to stand up to any troublemakers in her village despite her advancing years. She maintains a fine political balance between the clergy, merchants, and commoners in her town, using diplomacy and information to defuse arguments.

If anyone attacks the elder, she calls for guards (warriors 3) and recruits (warriors 1) to protect her, and most other townsfolk call for additional help if they can not or dare not assist her directly.

A gruff, no-nonsense sort, a constable prefers a stern warning to violence, but doesn't hesitate to crack a belligerent nuisance over the head.

Depending on the size of the town she protects, the constable's minions may include guards (warriors 3), a larger number of recruits (warriors 1), and perhaps a tavern champion (warrior 5). In a smaller community, she may only be able to gather a group of pig farmers (commoners 2) and perhaps some miners (commoners 4) to serve as a militia. Unless dealing with monsters, the constable's job is to arrest and detain, not kill.

A trusted and respected pillar of his community, a traitor keeps a kind face and speaks honeyed words, all the while betraying his people for his own selfish gain. In the long run, he doesn't care who gets hurt or killed by his devious plans, as long as he is able to profit from it in terms of status or wealth.

The traitor may have the village elder (commoner 8) under his thumb, or may keep several ruffians (commoners 7) at his beck and call. If allied with an evil cult, he may be able to get help from enforcers (adepts 5) or initiates (adepts 3) to enact his plans and keep a cultist (adept 10) on a short leash or at a safe distance.
