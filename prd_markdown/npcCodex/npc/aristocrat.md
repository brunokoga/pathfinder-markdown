This nervous young page alternates between avoiding unwanted attention and desperately trying to impress any nobles who send him on errands. His duties involve carrying messages (whether on parchment or memorized) within the palace grounds or a city, delivering packages, escorting the retainers of visiting officials, and so on.

Sometimes a package carried by a page contains something quite valuable, though if that is the case, the page is usually accompanied by one or more guards (warriors 3). The additional wealth in the page's stat block may account for such items, though in most cases the page only carries a few silver coins for his own personal use plus a few gold pieces for his employer's expenses.

Well-rounded in her training, the princess is a demure lady of the court who handles herself quite well in a fight. She has a stubborn streak and a taste for adventure, and doesn't like commoners telling her what she can and can't do.

Most of her remaining wealth is in the form of fine jewelry, such as rings, necklaces, a tiara, or a scepter. These items are quite recognizable as belonging to the royal family and sure to cause suspicion if they are found in the hands of anyone else.

**Combat Gear** holy water; **Other Gear** chainmail, composite shortbow (+1 Str) with 20 arrows, dagger, masterwork longsword, bit and bridle, light horse (combat trained), riding saddle, saddlebags, 11 gp

This squire has begun his knightly training, but not yet earned his spurs. He aspires to match the valor and chivalry of the finest knights. Most of his duties involve caring for his knight's armor, weapons, and horse, holding prisoners taken by the knight, and giving the knight an honorable burial if he is killed.

The knight may instruct the squire to follow him into battle. If the squire proves himself loyal, skilled, and reliable in combat, his knight may choose to elevate him to full knight status (though in some lands this ceremony may only be performed by the ruler). A knight may have many squires, but a squire serves only one knight.

The heir apparent has been groomed to rule since birth, yet aspires to an even greater destiny. She welcomes the obligations of a ruling queen, and hopes to accomplish deeds of great heroism, justice, and mercy during her time on the throne. She is normally accompanied by guards (warriors 3) or officers (aristocrats 6).

Some of her remaining wealth is in the form of royal regalia, such as a circlet, and is easily recognized as royal property.

**Ranged** dagger +7 (1d4–1/19–20)

Exposed since birth to the contentious relationships between disparate races and nationalities, the diplomat found her calling in resolving the differences of others. Her half-elven lifespan means she has dealt with three or more generations of human nobility in various countries and is well versed in evolving etiquette. Slow-burning feuds and several attempts on her life have made her cautious and patient in her work.

Some of her remaining wealth is in the form of jewelry appropriate to her station (worth approximately 50 gp).

**Space** 5 ft.; **Reach** 5 ft. (10 ft. with lance)

Tactics

**Before Combat** Before a fight or joust, the aristocrat drinks his _potions of [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_ and _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_.

**During Combat** The aristocrat opens with a charge. When confronting foes on foot, he stows his lance, then attacks with his longsword. Against mounted foes, he wheels about and charges so he can use Unseat, repeating this until all his opponents are dismounted. If he is unable to hit a well-armored rider, he is not above attacking the mount instead.

**Base Statistics** Without _ [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_ and _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_, the aristocrat's statistics are **hp** 58; **Fort** +4; **Melee** mwk lance +10/+5 (1d8+3/×3) or _+1 longsword_ +10/+5 (1d8+4/19–20); **Str** 16, **Con** 12; **CMB** +9; **CMD** 20.

Although this tarnished knight considers his honor beyond reproach, he covets personal glory and seeks the humiliation of his enemies. Whether commanding a host of knights to rout tribes of hobgoblins or orcs or touring the land in search of jousting competitions, the knight is a tall, towering figure, striking fear into the hearts of his opponents.

The knight does not fear battle and refuses to cheat or use underhanded methods to achieve victory. He does not believe that using magic is cheating, though he prefers spells and items that enhance natural prowess rather than ones that directly harm or afflict enemies, and frowns on knights, warlords, and monsters that use such cowardly tactics. His word is his bond, and he will negotiate an enemy's surrender to spare the lives of common troops from pointless slaughter.

The above stat block may be used for a military commander such as a general. It can also be used for a lesser scion of a noble or royal house—one who has little or no chance of inheriting the throne and is instead trained for war. Such a scion may be loyal to the crown or may attempt to gain support among the nobility to stage a coup and usurp the throne for himself or a foreign power.

**Ranged** mwk dagger +8/+3 (1d4–1/19–20)

Tactics

**During Combat** No stranger to battle, the aristocrat fights with his longsword and orders all available guards and retainers to slay his attackers for the crime of attacking his royal person. He takes full tactical command of the battle, directing each subject, and avoids actions that put him at risk. If it looks like he would be killed or captured, he directs his guards to block pursuers and tries to flee.

Though once an even-tempered and capable ruler, the king tires of the responsibilities of the crown and reflects fondly on his days as a questing noble knight, free of court intrigue and stifling castle walls. Petitioners who bore or offend him risk arousing his anger, as do sycophants and hangers-on. He admires soldiers, knights, and adventurers, though he doesn't tolerate disrespect of himself, his family, or his country.

If the king has a suitable heir (and therefore can afford to take minor risks with his own life), he may sate his desire for fresh air and action by going on hunting trips, accompanied by a select group of nobles and trusted guards. Player characters who earn his goodwill may be invited to these outings, but should be wary of outshining the king's skill at riding or hunting. The king giving unexpected attention to the PCs may anger other nobles and provide roleplaying and campaign plot opportunities.

Note that much of the king's wealth is in the form of royal regalia, such as a crown and royal seal. These items are easily recognized as royal property and any non-noble caught with them is assumed to be a thief. The king also has access to other jewelry and clothing that belongs to the official regalia of his office (such as crown jewels), which may be worth thousands of gold pieces or more.

The above stat block can also be used for a queen, adventuring prince or princess, or a (non-spellcaster) ruler of a powerful religious institution (especially in lands where it is customary for younger sons or daughters to become clergy).
