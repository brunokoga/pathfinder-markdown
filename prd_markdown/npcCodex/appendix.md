# Appendix 1: Animal Companions

This section presents an assortment of suitable druid and ranger animal companions at various effective druid levels. All of the druids and rangers in Chapter 1 are built with the nature bond (domain) or hunter's bond (companions) class abilities, so it is a simple matter to replace those abilities with an animal companion of the appropriate level. For druids, ignore the bonus spells and granted powers listed in the stat block; for rangers, ignore the hunter's bond ability (which otherwise does not affect the ranger's statistics in any way).

An asterisk (\*) after an animal companion's name indicates that only druids can select that type of companion.

# Appendix 2: Encounter Groups

By following the guidelines for building adventures and encounters in the Pathfinder RPG Core Rulebook (see pages 396â€“401), you can use the NPCs presented in this book to create a number of diverse and challenging encounters.

These are followed by the NPCs in the encounters, along with their races, classes, and levels, as well as the page where you can find each NPC.
