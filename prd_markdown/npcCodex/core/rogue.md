### Kelethiros

Kelethiros is a valuable and dangerous member of royal courts and secret societies, skilled at using subtle lies and disguises to turn enemies against each other. Using his talents—and a little help from his hat of disguise—he can infiltrate and spy upon any guild, government, or noble household. His only flaw is that he is easily distracted by an attractive face and strong, slender legs, and often has to extricate himself when confronted by hoodwinked lovers and enraged spouses.

Though able to move easily in most societies by virtue of his handsome face and disarming nature, Kelethiros is at heart a racist, and prefers to operate on behalf of elven interests against those of other races, particularly humans. He strongly resents the way that the shorter-lived races have expanded and achieved so much so quickly, and on those occasions when he allows his cover stories to slip, has often been heard to refer to the works of these other races as akin to "children playing at civilization." Of course, this general disdain for humanity doesn't keep him from taking human lovers while on his missions, and no doubt quite a few half-elves can trace their lineage to one of his false personas. His prejudice also makes it easier on those occasions when his missions or cover requires him to kill, as he tells himself with that killing humans and their ilk isn't really murder. After all, since they're going to die so soon anyway, he's only robbed them of a few decades at most—hardly anything for an elf to get upset about.

**Combat Encounters:** Kelethiros prefers to work behind the scenes, and avoids combat unless he's confident of winning. Instead, he uses disguise magic to turn the PCs' allies against them, to frame the PCs for an attack on someone, or to change his appearance just before the battle with the PCs begins so it looks like they have set upon some innocent person.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Like a doppelganger, Kelethiros could play many roles in a campaign, sometimes helping the PCs out with information, but just as often opposing or observing them.

The dancing dervish spins as a way to focus himself on achieving harmony with the gods.

### Lesath the Desert Sting

Lesath is a troubled man who acutely feels the pain of separation from the divine, and only when he has a sword in hand do his dark thoughts stop. For him, the dance of the sword is a means of finding peace and spiritual tranquility. He dances several times per day (whether or not he is in combat) as a silent prayer ritual. Afterward, he meditates to focus his memory on the joy of the prayer, sometimes unconsciously speaking some truth he learned from this connection. Though he often springs into battle if a cause seems justified and in keeping with his god's will, the truth is that the fighting is more important to him than the reason for it.

**Combat Encounters:** Lesath might watch over a group of pilgrims and rebuff any attempts by the PCs to interfere or communicate, or he might guard a holy site and refuse to allow the PCs to trespass.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** The PCs might discover Lesath surrounded by a ring of slain enemies, meditating and perhaps unknowingly speaking words of prophecy or divine truth. They might also find themselves saddled with the job of keeping him out of trouble.

If the target tries to flee, the contract killer uses Stand Still to prevent escape, or throws his poisoned dagger.

The contract killer uses stealth and poison to kill his latest target.

### Mollarn the Corpsemaker

Mollarn is an old elf, and the only constant he has found over the centuries is that people are fragile and prone to unexpected injuries and death. Having lost countless friends in his lifetime, he has given up on forming anything but the most casual attachments to others, and has transformed himself into an agent of death. Killing gives him no sense of satisfaction or pleasure—it is simply as common and routine as breathing. If he must kill others to reach his intended target, he does so without remorse or guilt.

**Combat Encounters:** Mollarn might arrive to murder one of the PCs or someone known to them. A victim could merely be an obstacle in Mollarn's path to his true target, and getting the person out of the way is enough to get Mollarn to proceed toward his intended foe.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Utterly without scruples, Mollarn might work for the PCs as an assassin. If he has been double-crossed by an employer, he might ask the PCs to help him get revenge, especially if the PCs dislike the one who betrayed him.

The dilettante developed magical abilities, but eventually decided to avoid both the arcane and divine paths.

### Neberton the Wise

Neberton could have been a spellcaster, but felt it required too much work. Instead, he uses his natural talents for trickery and altering his appearance to acquire money and shelter—and get company for his bed. He isn't malicious, but feels no remorse for conning the rich and gullible.

**Combat Encounters:** Neberton avoids combat if at all possible. A duped ally might turn on him, a spurned lover may send a champion (such as a PC) to duel him, or he could whip a crowd of "believers" into a mob intent on protecting their "savior."

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Neberton's talents make him a good "face" for a group of PCs lacking adequate diplomacy. His many schemes in various cities give him valuable information on high and low society, including the means to infiltrate exclusive parties or find the secret ins and outs of castles and mansions.

The guildmaster manipulates crime and politics—often the same thing—to create wealth and stability for himself and his devoted thieves.

### Olenjack the Axe

Olenjack worked his way up through the ranks of the guild he now runs with a patient but firm hand. He has always been unusually tall for a dwarf, and frequently jokes that he's used magic to make himself even taller. He is patient and deliberate, able to keep multiple schemes and long-term plans in mind simultaneously, and never forgets (or lets his acolytes forget) that as his dwarven lifespan is longer than that of his human enemies. He's often able to plan for the future, remain patient, and let his more brash enemies walk directly into the traps he's laid for them. His nickname refers to his habit of taking swift, decisive action after quiet planning, executing his will in one stroke. Yet despite his formidable nature, he's learned the value of spreading the wealth and not preying too heavily on locals. As a result, he remains a pillar of his community, highly respected even by those who suspect his criminal ties. Those living within his territory seek his advice and ask him for favors, most regarding him as a beneficent but firm grandfatherly figure without ever realizing his true hardhearted character.

**Combat Encounters:** Olenjack and his bodyguards might fight the PCs if a peaceful meeting goes terribly wrong, if the PCs betray him and he wants to personally teach them a lesson, or if they threaten the livelihood of his guild and have already proven themselves capable of overpowering his minions.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Given Olenjack's ties to the community, the PCs may interact with him in a king's court, at a meeting of mercantile guildmasters, or among the patrons of high society.

The chain mauler is a vicious sadist whose weapon allows her the bloodiest satisfaction.

### Peletha

Peletha's dark career as a torturer began as a child, when she collected live insects and pinned them to her wall with needles and nails. Soon she moved on to larger, bloodier animals, and started beating the children in her neighborhood at random. Taken in by a cult of the god of pain, she spent her teenage years as the "pet" of the high priest, learning to understand new heights of pain and how to inflict it upon others. Though she appreciates the delicacies of torture, she prefers more direct methods—namely, beating her victims with her magical spiked chain.

**Combat Encounters:** Peletha might hunt the PCs of her own volition, or pursue them on orders from her cultist masters. She could be encountered roaming the city or patrolling her cult's secret lair.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Peletha may allow herself to be shackled and used as bait for the PCs, pretending to be an innocent victim of the church of torturers. However, she is not good at lying or interacting with people in socially acceptable ways, and her true personality and role soon become obvious.

The unseen archer strikes from concealment, planning for his target to die before it has a chance to see him.

### Roscolian

Roscolian is a mercenary sniper, willing to work alone or as part of a team as long as he gets to fight at a safe distance, shooting at creatures that don't know he's there. He doesn't care whether it's unfair or unsportsmanlike; he'd rather be a coward with a hundred kills than a hero with a sword in his neck. He relies on his ring of invisibility to keep him out of trouble, and isn't averse to abandoning his companions and fleeing invisibly if a battle goes wrong. He doesn't particularly like dungeons because he feels the narrow tunnels don't allow enough space between him and his targets.

**Combat Encounters:** When invisible, Roscolian can attack from anywhere, surprising unsuspecting PCs with a hail of deadly arrows and staying hidden until he can activate his ring again. Since he works best at a distance, he prefers situations where he can kill a target and then move before he is discovered.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Roscolian doesn't brag about what he does, and the PCs might think he is just a humble, local scout or archer. He'll work for almost anyone, so the PCs may be able to hire him—though only on his terms.

**During Combat** The rogue uses Sickening Critical or [Intimidate](skills/intimidate#_intimidate) to hinder opponents so he can use Shatter Defenses to sneak attack them. If the opponent has magical protections, the rogue uses the dispelling attack rogue talent to break those defenses.

The mage slayer is trained and equipped to murder arcane spellcasters. Each one has some minor magical training, either from a church or arcane study.

### Skanrak

Skanrak was raised by a cult of religious zealots who believe arcane magic is a profane offense to the gods. He hates all arcane spellcasters with a passion, no matter what their class is, whether their magic is trained or natural, or toward what ends the magic is used. His hatred includes monsters that use arcane magic, such as nagas and dragons, and especially those that use magic to bypass the natural laws of death by becoming undead. He is very knowledgeable about arcane magic, recognizing signs of magic and quickly identifying a caster's class, bloodline, or favored school. He knows that a split-second hesitation could cost him his life, so he never makes witty chatter during a fight, instead going about his business with a grim and brutal efficiency.

**Combat Encounters:** Skanrak often works alone, targeting vulnerable individuals (like a solitary wizard crafting a magic item) who he can then isolate and attack. He might ally with priests of his cult, especially if they can ward him against hostile magic (such as with death ward, spell immunity, and spell resistance). He has no particular hatred for nonmagical creatures, but never gives more than one warning to stay out of his way, and frequently waives that warning if it's clear someone intends to stop him.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Skanrak may agree to a truce with a magic-wielding PC in exchange for help killing a dangerous opponent he cannot defeat alone, but the truce expires as soon as his objective is met.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The rogue prefers to work from the shadows, manipulating events and people to do his bidding. If combat is needed, he always attacks from surprise, when his foes least expect it.

**During Combat** The rogue prefers to move up, strike suddenly, withdraw before his foes can respond, and use his _ [hat of disguise](magicItems/wondrousItems#_hat-of-disguise)_ to change his appearance once he's out of sight. He relies on his rogue talents to protect him.

The masked lord manipulates events from the shadows, using a thousand different names. He creates conspiracies and topples empires without anyone ever knowing his true identity.

### Tadros the Hidden

Tadros is only comfortable when nobody knows he exists. His disguises have aliases and his aliases lead double lives. None of his contacts have any idea what he really looks like; they recognize him only by specific code words. In addition to taking on fictional identities, he pretends to be real people, creating no end of trouble.

**Combat Encounters:** In the unlikely event that the PCs face Tadros in direct combat, he almost certainly has an ace up his sleeve. The PCs may be fighting a simulacrum, or someone else disguised as one of Tadros's aliases, or (if he is desperate) his real self with a contingency plan to cover his resurrection.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** With his connections, identities, and plans, Tadros can be almost anyone, even temporarily replacing one of the PCs for a period of time.

The dagger master has perfected the technique of killing with a small blade.

### Vink the Blade

Vink considers himself a champion of the halfling people, their greatest son and the one who defends the small folk against any larger creature that threatens them. Having experienced a fair share of mockery because of to his size, Vink's definition of threatening a halfling is very broad, including slight insults, roughhousing by larger races, and legal actions that limit halfling rights. Though he normally uses his blades against tyrants and rampaging monsters, he's been known to obliterate entire caravans of slavers, murder government officials who demean halflings or treat them as second-class citizens, and assassinate bards or actors who perform plays that treat halflings as subjects of ridicule.

**Combat Encounters:** Vink might attack the PCs for something he considers a slight, or work with any group he thinks advances the cause of halflings. Expressing a sincere apology and offering a compensatory gift to a halfling community usually convinces him to back down without killing anyone.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** The PCs might encounter Vink as an easily-insulted, hot-tempered bravo defending halfling honor, rights, or territory. If the PCs include a halfling or have acted on behalf of a halfling community in the past, he might attempt to befriend them or seek their aid for a dangerous plan.

The death whisperer ends lives with a quiet sigh, freeing a last breath and a soul with one strike.

### Wu Shen

Wu Shen loves death as if it were an actual person. She speaks of death as "her lover" and never as "death" or any proper name, and listeners may mistakenly believe she is referring to a mortal person. She relishes every killing, seeing them as love notes of a sort. Death's affection is the most elusive prize, and each murder brings her a moment of hope that it will acknowledge her as its favorite. To challenge herself and prove her worthiness, she often sets specific criteria for her kills, such as death in exactly three hits, or from two different directions, or while holding a black rose in her off hand.

**Combat Encounters:** Wu Shen might select a PC to be the target of her latest challenge, attacking unexpectedly and retreating without saying a word if she fails to meet the self-imposed parameters of her challenge.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** With her highly romanticized way of speaking about "her lover," Wu Shen might convince the PCs to help her with specific killings under the pretense of deeds of heroic chivalry. The PCs may persuade her to help them with battles that would pose a unique enough challenge to attract her lover's attention.

The blade lord has attained mastery with swords by forsaking all other weapons.

### Yalandara

Yalandara has spent her long elven life perfecting the use of longswords, short swords, and rapiers. She has not even touched another kind of weapon in more than a hundred years, as she feels such things are beneath her. If her survival depends on using something other than a sword, she does what she must, but vents her rage on those around her.

**Combat Encounters:** Yalandara knows she doesn't have to prove her skill, but likes to teach upstarts a lesson, and might duel a martial character for fun.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Yalandara respects others who uses swords with skill, and may aid them in tasks that don't inconvenience her. The PCs might encounter her practicing swordplay in some extreme environment chosen to test her balance and concentration.
