### Corwyn Klas

When between jobs, Corwyn faithfully maintains his clothes, armor, and weapons, but once hired, he stops keeping up his appearance and grows more disheveled as the days pass.

Corwyn fears the supernatural, and keeps a holy symbol with him at all times. He blows his wages on worthless talismans sold with promises to work against fiends and spirits.

### Lisanne Jelansil

### Tomin Blanderbass

The wanderer's life suits Tomin just fine. He roams from town to town looking for mercenary work, and is more than happy to take gold from anyone who offers. Tomin doesn't really care about right or wrong, just about getting paid. He's as likely to guard a caravan as to rob one. He draws the line at hurting those who won't fight back, believing that's what separates him from a petty thug.

When he first started adventuring, Tomin and his companions ran afoul of a band of elves on the hunt for bandits. The elves ran down and slew Tomin's companions one by one, then left him tied up and dangling from a tree as a warning for others. That humiliation still burns in Tomin's belly, and he fears and detests elves to this day.

**Combat Encounters:** Tomin targets enemy elves first, and often refuses to treat with allies who have elves within their midst.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Tomin is not shy when looking for work—or when he wants to pick a fight with an elf.

**Space** 5 ft.; **Reach** 5 ft. (10 ft. with lance)

**Special Attacks** weapon training (spears +2, bows +1)

Tactics

**Before Combat** Well in advance of battle, the fighter activates her _bronze griffon_ and saddles and armors it. Before the fighting starts, she mounts her griffon, takes to the air, and quaffs her _potion of [heroism](spells/heroism.md#_heroism)_.

**During Combat** The fighter flies above the battlefield taking passes with her lance, never flying lower than 10 feet above the ground. If outmatched in melee, she retreats to higher altitude and uses her bow. A griffon rider loves to unseat other mounted combatants, particularly if they're flying. She keeps a plentiful supply of alchemist's fire in case any flammable targets present themselves.

Griffon riders patrol the skies around remote elven enclaves. Rare individuals serve powerful spellcasters or serve as mercenary shock troops.

### Jalynel Masathal

Always something of an outcast among other elves, Jalynel felt closer to her loyal griffon mount than to any of her fellow elven knights. When her mount perished in battle against a flock of perytons, Jalynel was devastated. Once she recovered from her own wounds, she deserted her unit and indentured herself to a powerful wizard. In exchange, he crafted for her a bronze figurine in the very image of her beloved griffon. Twice per week, she can place it on the ground and bring it life. Jalynel believes her companion's soul dwells within the figurine's cold bronze. She rests easy knowing a lethal wound now only turns her mount back to bronze, to be brought to life again another day.

Jalynel spends most of her time following orders from her wizard master. During her rare breaks from his service, she hires out as a scout and aerial cavalry. On occasion, she throws in with adventuring bands in hopes of finding good treasure that will appeal to her wizard master and allow her to pay off her debt quickly.

**Combat Encounters:** Jalynel is usually found protecting the domain of her wizard master, or amid an group of adventurers seeking magical treasure. She avoids traveling into dungeons or caverns if possible, preferring to be in open spaces where she can activate her figurine of wondrous power and fight from the air.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Jalynel approaches adventurers to form a group to go after valuable treasures, particularly those with magical substances or items she can return to her master.

### Eralin Lisinar

Sadistic and manipulative, Eralin prefers a long, drawn out battle over a clean and efficient kill. She deals death in nicks and cuts and twists of her blades. Never one for a fair fight, she deliberately seeks out opponents who can't match her skill.

These warriors serve as shock troops, wading through enemy forces and sundering their weapons and armor.

### Rogar Talgast

At a young age, Rogar left his clan to seek his fortune in the world. Quite tall for a dwarf, he found that in the wider world he missed the respect other dwarves gave him for his size. He befriended an alchemist who supplies him with enlarge person potions, and adapted his fighting style to match. Rogar prefers military duty when he can find it, especially if he can be in a small, elite squad. He's not picky about causes, but prefers to be well-supported by spellcasters. He offers quarter to defeated foes, insisting there's no shame in being beaten by a dwarf.

**Combat Encounters:** Rogar leads a group of warriors and spellcasters, attacking the enemies of his employer.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** When low on potions of enlarge person, Rogar seeks out spellcasters willing to brew such potions in great number for a reduced price.

Serving as a leader to orcs, half-orcs, or other barbaric forces, the brutal warlord uses her martial control to shape the battlefield.

### Livia Coldheart

Livia was born and raised in human society. Mocked and tormented for her bestial appearance, she grew to resent her human blood and the intolerant society it represented. As an adult, she met her first orcs only to find they too saw her as sullied by her half-breed heritage. But there was a difference: When she kicked in humans' teeth, they called her a monster. When she bashed in orcs' skulls, the rest cheered her on.

Livia roams the outskirts of orc lands, melding small tribes into her larger band through raw force and primal magnetism. She handpicks her lieutenants from the most disciplined orcs, and has slowly transformed her horde from a disorganized rabble into a semblance of an disciplined army. She dreams that, in time, she will rule an empire of orcs and half-orcs.

Mixing martial prowess with magic support, arcane pretenders typically serve as guards for powerful casters. Other arcane pretenders become adventurers, sellswords, or explorers.

### Flenta Casalina

Flenta always wanted to be a wizard. She studied, memorized, and practiced, but still can't cast spells. She has, however, discovered a knack for manipulating magic items. Flenta passes herself off as a fighter with sorcerous skills, pretending to be casting spells rather than activating magic items (a ruse that rarely fools those with knowledge of spellcasting). If confronted, she insists that she gets the job done regardless of her methods. Deep down, Flenta still hopes to someday unlock the magical potential she's sure she possesses, whatever it takes.

**Combat Encounters:** Flenta often attacks groups with arcane spellcasters just to see what magic they have.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Always searching for new magic secrets she can understand (or fake), Flenta strikes up conversations about magic, magic items, and their use with anyone who seems likely to know about such things.

Serving as the captains of pirate ships or the commandants of pirate fleets, pirate kings command those pressed into their service with ruthless efficiency.

### Dalithan of the Black Hand

No dashing swashbuckler, Dalithan might best be described as a dastard in search of a crime. He leads his fleet on pirate raids by land and sea; hires his ships out for mercenary contracts; and dabbles in assassination, extortion, ransom, and smuggling as well. The warrants that authorities and victims try to put out for his death go unsigned thanks to a few well-placed bribes. Though he's widely regarded as a cold-hearted villain, his crewmates know the captain has a peculiar fondness for seals, often ordering meat—such as prisoners—chopped up and thrown overboard for them.

Dwarven arbalesters are usually employed by slavers and warlords to either incapacitate or kill at a distance.

### Stigr Harrowstare

Exiled from the stronghold of his ancestors for slave trafficking with duergar, Stigr took his slaving to human lands instead. He fancies himself the deadliest shot with a crossbow ever born, and considers a battle decided by melee a personal failure. Stigr keeps losing horses in battle, and plans to trade sacrificial victims to the church of Asmodeus in exchange for a Nessian warhound.

### Selindril Longstrider

A century ago, Selindril abandoned civilization. Years in the wilderness made her distant, ill-mannered, and confrontational. She keeps a regular journal devoted half to her travels and half to rambling screeds on her personal philosophy of extreme isolationism.

Many failed disciples wander the land purely to prove their martial prowess. Others latch on to evil cults, dealing death for a dark god.

### Urguk the Chosen

As a child, a cult of apocalyptic monks kidnapped Urguk to raise him as a champion of their order. Their teachings of violence and scorn for life took hold, but their attempts to install obedience and inner discipline did not. Urguk mastered many of their techniques, but never in a fashion that pleased them. Frustrated by his failures and unwilling to let Urguk leave with intimate knowledge of their order, the monks decided to terminate their experiment.

Urguk had learned their lessons better than he knew. He killed the monks sent to murder him and fled into the night.

Though most criminal masterminds work behind the scenes, crime lords don't mind getting their hands dirty.

### Tontelizi Legbreaker

When Tontelizi first took to a life of crime, he was relegated to leg-breaking as a joke on his slight stature—and collections doubled. Soon, the crime family found that Tontelizi excelled at any task involving extortion, intimidation, or violence. When the patriarch's health failed—assisted by Tontelizi's poison—the gnome eliminated two likely successors and cowed the rest with threats and blackmail. He was chosen to take over the family with nearly unanimous support.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The fighter applies _oil of [greater magic weapon](spells/magicWeapon.md#_magic-weapon-greater)_ to his falchion and _oil of [magic vestment](spells/magicVestment.md#_magic-vestment)_, then drinks his _potions of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_, _ [heroism](spells/heroism.md#_heroism)_, and _ [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_ and activates his _boots of flying_.

**During Combat** The fighter attacks a single enemy until he deals a pair of critical hits, then switches to another. He usually opts to inflict stun and bleed, then blind and exhaust. He goes after good outsiders, paladins, and clerics of good-aligned deities first.
