Though most druids tend and protect the wild lands that lie under the open sky, others stalk the tunnels that lie beneath the earth, serving as wardens, protectors, and tenders of vermin and fungi.

### Zirul

Zirul is the solemn protector of a large cave system that is rife with bats and vermin of all kind. Having been abandoned here at a young age, she sees the cave as her home, and will not allow anyone to access it. She dresses in dark, splotched clothing to better blend in with the cavern walls, and has lost some of her humanity as a result of living so far from civilization for so long.

**Combat Encounters:** Zirul's combat axiom is that a good defense lays the groundwork for a devastating offense. She always makes sure to enter combat from a position of defensive strength.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Zirul has nearly lost her ability to feel empathy for other humanoids. She constantly mutters to herself and to the rats that swarm around her, ignoring other people's perturbed reactions to her odd behavior.

Evasive as the wind, these skittish druids tend to stay away from others, using their formidable powers to escape even the most hazardous situations.

### Velun The Slip

Once a slave, Velun escaped bondage with the help of a druid, who went on to train him. Once he felt he had learned all he could, he killed the druid, turning the mentor's wolf animal companion into a cloak. Velun now lives completely off the land, deathly afraid of cities and the slavers he believes lurk around every corner.

**Combat Encounters:** Given his extreme paranoia, Velun rarely teams up with any other sentient creatures, and the few times he does, he make sure they have few connections to other people so word of his location won't reach the ears of slavers or other corrupt city folk. Velun tries to stay out of combat, using his summoned creatures to ensure his escape.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Velun tends to think that all creatures that come looking for him are slavers in disguise. If he sees them coming, he sneaks away if he can. If they do manage to talk to him, he tells them almost nothing, as he believes that seeming useful or friendly makes him an even more appealing target for slavers. After he's encountered new people, Velun relocates to a new campsite so no one can track him down.

Some druids seek the peace and tranquility that only a small island can offer and are willing to lay down their life to protect their sanctuary.

### Tasseira Sprayspirit

Tasseira is one of the grim elven defenders of a far-off island that contains an ancient evil. She sees all non-elves as trespassing on her domain, and attacks them on sight. She has a very close connection to the sea, spending much of her day wild shaped into an aquatic creature. She wears an ornate wooden mask to hide her features, and loose-fitting clothes of green and blue.

TACTICS

**Before Combat** The druid casts _ [barkskin](spells/barkskin#_barkskin)_ and _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength#_bull-s-strength)_.

**During Combat** The druid is well aware of his physical shortcomings, and wild shapes into a Medium air elemental the first chance he gets to escape melee combat. Once at a safe altitude, he casts _ [wind wall](spells/windWall#_wind-wall)_ and _ [freedom of movement](spells/freedomOfMovement#_freedom-of-movement)_. If still threatened, he casts offensive spells such as _ [flame strike](spells/flameStrike#_flame-strike)_ or _ [sleet storm](spells/sleetStorm#_sleet-storm)_, or uses his Weather domain spell-like abilities. If targeted by spellcasters, he casts _ [fog cloud](spells/fogCloud)_ to obscure vision. If forced into melee, he casts _ [greater magic fang](spells/magicFang#_magic-fang-greater)_ before wild shaping into a Huge animal (preferably a triceratops or an orca).

With their ability to control and harness the powers of winds and storms, a number of druids become sea captains, using their abilities sometimes for trade and other times for piracy.

### Edal

Edal is the captain of the Unlucky Halfling, a pirate vessel that harasses busy sea-lanes. The ship is named in honor of Edal himself, who had the misfortune of losing an eye and four fingers to a voracious reefclaw during his youth. He is a thrill-seeker, willing to sail seas that most other captains avoid. He feels at home in the middle of a huge storm.

**Combat Encounters:** Edal is most often found on his ship, along with his crew. When his crew is diminished, he sails in to a port, where he leads press gangs to round up new crew members.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** A thrill-seeker by nature, Edal is quick to tell a bawdy joke, accept a dare, or even start a tavern brawl so that he can prove his mettle.

Stalking through boiling and sometimes acidic mud pits, these druids have caustic personalities and abilities.

### Kiro

Kiro, the mud shaman of a remote tribe, sees outsiders as a threat to his culture and people. He acquired a green dragonhide breastplate years ago from a trader, but keeps it hidden under cloaks and wraps, ashamed that he had to buy it rather than earn it through combat.

**Combat Encounters:** Kiro uses mud pits as traps to entangle his enemies.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** A stubborn xenophobe, Kiro does not like speaking with those who are not of his tribe.

### Sasrukutenek

Sasrukutenek sells water at a trade stop on the overland route between two desert cities. She overcharges for this commodity, but since it's so scarce, her customers have very little choice.

These guardians of mountain peaks traffic with air and ice elementals, summoning forth the spirits of the mountain storms in order to protect their sacred places.

### Yala of the High Places

Yala lives on a mountaintop far to the north. Abandoned by her parents at a young age because of the inconvenience her mixed heritage caused both their families, she was raised by a tribe of yetis, who quickly began venerating her when her druidic powers developed. Never feeling entirely comfortable with her role or the society of the great creatures, she now lives a solitary existence tending a remote shrine dedicated to winter and the mountains themselves. Her enchanted shield was a gift from a courting yeti chief, but she ultimately rejected his advances.

**Combat Encounters:** Whenever possible, Yala faces enemies near a precipice, using her air magic to throw her foes from the heights and dash them against the rocks below—a blood offering to the ancient mountains.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** A cold and aloof woman, Yala prefers the company of animals and summoned elementals to that of humanoids. She is obsessed with protecting the purity of her mountain home, but what "angers the stones" is often hard for others to predict.

By way of a shipwreck or magical transportation, some druids find themselves alone on far-flung islands.

### Passago

Passago lives on a lonely tropical island and considers himself its master. He and his daughter were teleported there years ago by a jealous wizard, and quickly came to love it. When wild shaping, he prefers to take on the forms of the animals of his island.

**Combat Encounters:** Passago loves both his adopted island home and his daughter. If either is threatened, he quickly comes to their defense. He would lay down his life to defend either one of them.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Stubborn and proud, Passago believes he is the master of his island, and as such does not need to explain himself or his actions to anyone.

These druids see themselves not as protectors of the forest, but as part of it, like the fey they associate with.

### Pai Spiritwind

An inhabitant of a fey-infested forest, Pai fiercely advocates for the fey and their causes. After many run-ins with destructive humans, she considers all non-fey creatures (excluding gnomes) to be trespassers and attacks them on sight.

Controlling the power of fire and earth, these druids are natural wrath incarnate.

### Karuth Firesoul

Karuth Firewalker is a truly inspired fire druid—and he is quite possibly insane. A few years ago, a fateful encounter with a prophetic elder fire elemental gave Karuth the impression that, unlike other humans, he has no soul. Rather, inside him rages a core of elemental fire—a fire that must be released, thus conveniently justifying his pyromaniac urges.

**Combat Encounters:** Karuth attacks with no warning, laughing maniacally as he burns alive any whom he encounters.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Although Karuth is evil, he occasionally suffers from periods of strange lucidity and regret. During these times he tearfully asking those who seem like they have a chance of standing against his fearful might to grant him release from his evil compulsions through death.
