The noble crusader battles the forces of chaos, usually at the behest of a local monarch.

### Oriedesme Eisbrin

Oriedesme is a crusader for law against the forces of chaos. As a minor noble, she frequently allies with other members of the nobility, who call her "Esme the Peacemaker." She considers it her duty to eliminate dangerous monsters and even peasant uprisings that threaten to turn bloody. She serves a good and just goddess and refuses to participate in evil acts such as terrorizing villagers, but frowns on acts of anarchy that risk plunging an area into war. She believes nobles are chosen by the gods to rule over others for the benefit of all, even if this means fewer freedoms for commoners. She is painfully honest, and reluctant to work with any noble who shirks responsibilities or abuses power.

**Combat Encounters:** Esme works well alone or in a leadership role. She might be an ally of a powerful character, using her neutrality to get things done for a good employer or moderating a nearly evil one.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Esme might ask for assistance in dealing with an undead or fiendish threat beyond her capabilities. She could serve as an important intermediary with the local nobility, especially if the PCs have preexisting conflicts with the nobles. Esme could also be cynically close to losing her faith, giving the PCs the opportunity to save her before she falls from grace.

The carousing champion serves the god of freedom, bravery, and ale, and uses his significant abilities to bring happiness to common folk and stand up against oppression of all sorts.

### Eggal Torkelson

Eggal is a friendly, outgoing young halfling, generous with his spirit, spirits, money, and affection­—but not particularly bright. Fortunately, Eggal is so likable and headstrong that few ever try to take advantage of him, and those who do discover that his lack of "book learning" hasn't done anything to dull his innate cunning, and he remembers who has done him wrong every bit as well as he recalls who has done him favors, repaying both with interest. He wants to see the world and enjoy life, and doesn't particularly care whether people are good or selfish as long they don't try to hurt him or anyone he cares about—to him, his god's creed of freedom above all means accepting that some people were born mean-spirited, and are entitled to their pettiness and jealousy as long as they don't go out of their way to oppress others. For his own part, he'd rather help someone than ignore a request for aid, and has been known to expound at length upon the simple joys of helping others. He avoids killing unless absolutely necessary, even among those more "monstrous" humanoid races, but hates undead with a passion and goes out of his way to destroy such abominations.

**Combat Encounters:** Though he is hard to influence with magic, clever lies and subtle manipulation can easily turn Eggal against the PCs, and it's not uncommon for him to come into conflict with the lawful authorities in a region if he feels they are profiting at the expense of the common people. If he sees the PCs as agents of oppression, regardless of their justifications, he's likely to oppose them—with his mace if necessary. Because of his reluctance to kill, he is useful for an encounter where the PCs should negotiate or surrender instead of fighting.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Eggal can be a reliable feature of local taverns, even showing up in other cities where the PCs travel. Because he tends to help when asked, he might end up in over his head and need rescuing, or have friends in need of rescue. He can also help out the PCs as an ally against undead, as a backup healer, or as a contact in Cayden Cailean's church.

The vivisectionist cleric serves the god of pain and darkness, and can keep victims alive for weeks.

### Melisai Hesani

Melisai is personable despite her arrogance, and considers herself a surgeon and a sculptor. When not adventuring, she works with poorhouse medics, embalmers preparing bodies, and torturers—anyone who gives her the opportunity to experiment. She prefers the company of like-minded adventurers, but if none are available, she animates zombies.

Combat Encounters: Melisai is useful as an enemy leader, member of a rival adventuring party, or servant of an important NPC or villain.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Though evil and disturbing, Melisai is easy to get along with. She is forthright, and has no problem helping the PCs if it achieves her own ends.

The wrath priest serves the primordial god of disaster and destruction, striking down innocents and enemies with fire, blade, and hatred. He is a quintessential nihilist, and can not be bought or reasoned with except as it furthers his god's horrific ends.

### Aznek

Aznek is cruel, violent, and destructive—a childhood bully given profane magic and physical might. He loves the screams of his victims, and smashes beautiful things for the fun of it. He likes having strong minions, and encourages them to challenge him for dominance, though none has succeeded. He lets these would-be rivals live, albeit with broken arms or legs as reminders of their failure.

**Combat Encounters:** Aznek makes a good solo encounter, boss of a group of raiders (especially orcs), or minion of a strong leader or powerful warbeast.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Aznek's nature makes it difficult to interact with him except as his servant.

A death priest serves the goddess of plague and undeath, and seeks to infect, kill, and animate anyone who stands in her way. She might desire to one day become undead, but remains alive for now so she can carry out tasks in places that would never allow the undead.

### Relyk Zahim

Relyk obsesses over death and undead, and is in love with her goddess. She longs to become her favored servant and lover, and bestows her strange affections on corpses and undead that remind her of the dark goddess. Relyk always has a bit of a cold or some other minor sickness, though these never debilitate her or affect her abilities in any way; her symptoms might merely be affectations to ward off the unwary or show her devotion. She helps those who want to become undead do so, and is willing to assist other members of her church. However, she watches for anyone who might pass her in prominence within the church. Rivals for her god's affection or attention find that Relyk quickly becomes a devious, heartless enemy.

**Combat Encounters:** Relyk can be used as a solo opponent, but is much more dangerous with undead allies. Because she is healed by negative energy, she can sustain herself and multiple undead with her channel energy ability, and may pretend to be undead to gain an advantage over gullible enemies.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Relyk can be an advocate for a country ruled by undead, the commander of a large tribe of underground ghouls, or a daytime liaison for a cabal of vampires. When she defeats an enemy, she "graciously" offers to raise him as undead.

The mother of beasts serves the goddess of madness and monsters. She looks after horrible creatures and summons extraplanar beings to defend herself and her pets.

### Empiri Chalemede

Empiri raises and nurtures hybrid monsters and aberrant mutations. Though she lacks the magic to create these oddities, she values anyone skilled at such things.

**Combat Encounters:** Empiri is most effective when she has monsters to protect her. Without allies, she uses summon monster spells to conjure guardians.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Empiri might ask the PCs to help her catch a predatory beast—though not to destroy it.

The trickster priest serves the goddess of trickery and revenge, using guile and magic to manipulate others.

### Unam Clarefield

Unam is affectionate but fickle, philandering but jealous, and inconsiderate but vengeful. To those in his favor, he plays the part of an excellent and dependable ally, but easily turns on those he feels have insulted or jilted him. He is more than willing to influence or control his so-called friends, abandoning them in dangerous situations.

**Combat Encounters:** With his charm and spells, Unam usually has several followers who are willing to die to prove their affection. He tries to use spells carefully so these "pets" don't come to any harm by his hand.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Unam is eager to avenge old slights or help others in their quests for vengeance, especially if there is an attractive PC he can spend time with.

### Birn Hengdel

Birn became a mercenary when her unit was cut off and her home city fell. Over the years, she has gathered many warriors under her banner. She lives only for battle, refusing to become attached to followers she may have to sacrifice.

**Combat Encounters:** Birn loyally serves whoever pays her, so she might face the PCs while in the employ of any villain.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Because she works for the highest bidder, Birn might just switch sides if given a better offer.

The sacred guardian serves the goddess of beauty and love. He protects a holy site, preferring to deflect and warn rather than harm or destroy.

### Pindle Finberry

An aficionado of art, music, and sculpture, Pindle would be content spending his days creating beautiful things for people to wear and use. He knows there is ugliness in the world that would destroy all beauty, so he has sworn to be a shield against these defilers. In his heart, he wants peace and serenity, and hopes that his words and deeds can turn away the forces of destruction. While many might see him as an idealistic hero, the truth is that Pindle values art more than people, and will happily steal or overlook suffering if it's necessary to preserve great art.

**Combat Encounters:** Pindle is a capable guardian and might agree to guard a place or thing as a favor for an allied church or devotee of beauty—even if this pits him against good-aligned PCs. If the PCs steal a valuable gem, art object, or magic item relevant to his interests (or if he has been led to believe this), he might track them down and insist that they return it, or even take it by force if necessary.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Pindle is knowledgeable about art, gems, famous armors, and similar topics. He'd gladly accompany most PCs to an exotic location of great beauty or in search of a lost art object.

### Soufara Ebonwind

Soufara is a high priestess and assassin for the god of secrets and murder. Because her god wipes secrets from Soufara's mind once she no longer needs to know them, her memory is full of holes. Ordinary events that trigger faint echoes of lost memories can make her shake with fear or rage.

**Combat Encounters:** Soufara might direct a group of master assassins, dealing with spellcasters while her allies kill the rest.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Soufara might help PCs in exchange for magic that can heal her memory loss.
