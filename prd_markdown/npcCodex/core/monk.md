**Special Attacks** +1 on attack rolls against goblinoid and orc humanoids, flurry of blows, stunning fist (9/day, DC 18)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk drinks his _potions of [mage armor](spells/mageArmor.md#_mage-armor)_ and _ [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_ and tries to find a choke point where he can stand fast and hold off his enemies.

**During Combat** If he can control an opening such as a doorway, the monk does his best not to move or let others past. He uses [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike) whenever he cannot use flurry of blows. He uses Improved Bull Rush on any opponent that has failed its saving throw versus Scorpion Style, trying to remove it from direct combat. He trips those adjacent to him so he can make attacks of opportunity when they stand up from prone. Against a single opponent, the steadfast defender uses his _ki_ pool to add extra attacks to his flurry of blows; against multiple opponents he uses it to improve his Armor Class.

### Branock Ulgrehn

Branock's friends and surviving enemies call him "The Immovable." Mixing dwarven stubbornness with his monk's training, Branock excels when he is guarding a single chokepoint. He was born the son of a minor dwarven thane, but chose to betray his family in exchange for the hand of the daughter of his father's rival. His betrayal was for naught, however, as he was double-crossed by his family's enemies and cast out from his childhood home. Now he hires himself out to this group or that, always searching for a way to erase his shame and win his way back into the warm embrace of his homeland, though he knows that this feat will prove to be nearly impossible—for dwarves do not easily forgive treachery.

**Combat Encounters:** Branock is typically employed to limit the escape routes on a battlefield. Other times he is hired on as a bodyguard or a bouncer, and could even be found guarding the vault in a bank or royal treasury.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** While Branock often seems talkative and friendly, he rarely speaks of his shameful past to strangers. When he does, he tends to gloss over the details of his treachery and subsequent exile.

**During Combat** The monk charges, using [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike) in conjunction with Stunning Fist. Against stunned opponents, she employs her falchion and [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack). If surrounded or adjacent to a particularly powerful combatant, she uses Improved Bull Rush and then [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge), pushing her enemies away and then forcing them to close again.

These monks often serve as enforcers and bounty hunters for monastic orders or lawful lords, tracking down those in need of punishment.

### Tiaret the Huntress

Tiaret hunts violent criminals. She was once an initiate among a peaceful order of monks, but then her monastery was destroyed by brigands. Tiaret was the only survivor, and her firststint as a bounty hunter involved hunting down each of the attackers and bringing them to justice. Since then, Tiaret has continued to use her talents to capture lawbreakers. Though she prefers jobs where the bounty is wanted dead or alive, if she thinks an opponent might have value, she attacks with nonlethal force and renders the foe unconscious.

**Combat Encounters:** Tiaretprefers to work alone, as tracking an enemy requires a level of stealth and precision sellswords and spellcasters often lack. When forced to seek allies against a particularly powerful foe, she prefers the company of rogues and rangers.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Often sullen and stern, Tiaret is ever observant, always searching for those wanted by the law and trying to overhear conversations of people she believes are plotting to break the law. She has no tolerance for those who harass monks, cleric, inquisitors, or oracles. She believes in following the letter of the law, and cares little about the spirit.

**Special Attacks** flurry of blows, stunning fist (11/day, DC 18)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk conceals her shuriken as the metal cymbals inside her tambourine, applying 2 doses of black adder venom or drow poison to the weapons before combat. She performs, bluffs, or connives her way to her target.

**During Combat** If the monk finds herself outnumbered, she uses flurry of blows with her poisoned shuriken. She shifts and feints through a melee. If her feint is successful, she trips that foe. Once the foe is on the ground, she slams down with a Stunning Fist. A poisonous performer does not hesitate to abandon combat if outmatched or seriously injured, drinking her _potion of [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_ and fleeing the field to a place where she can drink a _potion of [disguise self](spells/disguiseSelf.md#_disguise-self)_, blend in, and disappear.

The poisonous performer is a member of a monastery that seeks enlightenment in the perfection of murder and assassination. Such monks are poison users and masters of disguise, and often greatly feared in the lands around their monasteries. They are sometimes hunted by monks from other monasteries who believe their grim rites are a perversion of proper monastic practices.

### Natessa the Angel of Death

Natessa came to the monastery on the far island when she was a young woman. She told the monks she had accidently killed a man with her horse, and wondered why it made her feel complete, at one with all being. The monks ushered her in, and though she was older than the other pupils, they trained her in the discipline of holy killing. Since that day, she has risen in the ranks, and is now one the monastery's prized slayers. Few expect the pretty but forgettable girl with the youthful gait to be a seasoned and a brutal killer.

**Combat Encounters:** Most people don't know they are in combat with Natessa until they have poisoned shuriken sticking out of them. Natessa usually works alone, but has been known to bring support for a particularly well-guarded target. She has also been associated with a small number of adventuring parties, but typically under a false identity.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** While she's hunting a mark, Natessa takes on the persona of a traveling tambourine player or a prostitute.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk uses [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) to find a hiding spot in an effort to gain the element of surprise.

**During Combat** The monk uses Deflect Arrows to close in on ranged combatants. He uses [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge) to keep enemies at bay and flurry of blows to trip multiple opponents if surrounded, allowing him the full benefit of his [Combat Reflexes](feats.md#_combat-reflexes) when tripped opponents try to stand. A swift brawler uses [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack) against enemies he has tripped or stunned, only risking the penalty on his attack rolls when his target's AC has been compromised in some way.

Swift brawlers serve as the vanguard of many monasteries' forces. They use speed and agility to track down and neutralize enemy leaders and spellcasters.

### Ryoto

Once Ryoto was a gambler, a killer, and a thief. And then one day he walked away from that life—a depraved and wine-hazed existence of vice and violence. He sat down before the gates of a monastery high up in the hills, and did not move for over a week, meditating without food or water. When he finally spoke, he looked up at the monks of the order and merely said, "I am now you." The monks, sensing the fundamental truth in this cryptic statement, silently opened their doors and accepted him as one of their own.

When he came to the monastery, Ryoto was powerful and crafty, but undisciplined. The monks saw his potential, however, and did their best to break him down and remake him into a perfect warrior. After years of routine and training, he is now one of the greatest fighters in the school, and is revered and thought of as a great teacher, despite—or perhaps because of—the fact that he has not said a single word since entering the monastery.

**Combat Encounters:** Ryoto is the first one to come to the defense of his order, or to right some wrong he sees.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** As someone who refuses to speak, or sometimes even to acknowledge the existence of others, Ryoto is difficult for others to communicate with. His companions often don't know his intent until he acts.

**Special Attacks** flurry of blows, stunning fist (13/day, DC 20)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk tries to find cover from which to snipe at his enemies, using abundant step in conjunction with [Stealth](skills/stealth.md#_stealth) to make enemies think they face multiple attackers.

**During Combat** If the monk must enter melee, he uses Stunning Fist against flat-footed or disadvantaged opponents. If successful, he then uses his rapier in conjunction with [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack) and [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike). If he's outnumbered, the monk uses Spring Attack and [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike) to whittle down his foes.

Both archers and diplomats, monastic snipers consider a well-placed warning shot the ideal method to open the channels of diplomacy from a position of power.

### Tourindall Andarael

Many elves defend their enclaves with both well-placed arrows and honeyed words. Tourindall uses those same tactics to defend his fellow monks and their home. When strangers enter his order's lands, Tourindall is sent to spy on them and possibly warn them away.

**Combat Encounters:** Tourindall negotiates his way out of a fight if he can. If battle breaks out but negotiation still seems feasible, he disarms a single foe then offers to parley, or gets away to drink his potion of glibnessbefore returning to talk.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Tourindall is proud of his knowledge of both history and religion, and comes off as overly academic. He often weaves into his negotiations proverbs and myths from a variety of religions.

**Special Attacks** flurry of blows, stunning fist (14/day, DC 22)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk often tries to reason or treat with potential foes in an effort to avoid unnecessary combat, or to quietly study enemies and discern each one's strengths and weaknesses. Once combat is unavoidable, he drinks _potions of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_ and _ [bull's strength](spells/bullSStrength.md#_bull-s-strength)_.

**During Combat** The monk trusts his improved evasion, high saves, and spell resistance to safeguard him against spellcasters, and focuses on martial opponents, combining Spring Attack and Stunning Fist. He uses [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge) against Small or Medium opponents, often using _ki_ points to grant himself a bonus to AC and negate the penalty from using [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge). When making a flurry of blows, he attempts a Stunning Fist on the first strike. He uses [Snatch](monsters/monsterFeats.md#snatch) Arrows to return thrown weapons and [Deadly Aim](feats.md#_deadly-aim) whenever he catches a weapon he is proficient with.

These monks are small, but powerful and well trained. Those who underestimate one of these halflings do so at their own peril.

### Laoshi

Laoshi listens to the wind, and always does its bidding. Sometimes it tells him to help those in need. Other times it tells him to play his flute while a city burns. It's also led him on a number of adventures.

**Combat Encounters:** Though lawful, Laoshi is a servant of the wind. This can sometimes lead him to seemingly random acts, including outbursts of violence. In the end, however, it usually works out for the common good.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Laoshi makes his way through the land, playing his flute for the occasional coin. He hears much and often passes on that information to those the wind suggests.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk drinks _potions of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_ and _ [cat's grace](spells/catSGrace.md#_cat-s-grace)_.

**During Combat** This monk prefers to use improvised weapons like ladders, tankards, and chisels. If he happens upon a particularly effective and sturdy improvised weapon, he applies _oil of [greater magic weapon](spells/magicWeapon.md#_magic-weapon-greater)_ before rejoining the fray. In familiar terrain, he tries to stun or trip a foe as a standard action and then uses his abundant step ability to seek cover where he can hide. The dwarf then pelts his adversaries with anything on hand.

Typically found among tavern brawlers, an improvised hurler turns ordinary objects into devastating weapons.

### Creighton Flintfinger

As a child, Creighton hurled his cup at an older boy and knocked him out cold. From that point on, the world was his weapon. Each foe the dwarf faces is a puzzle—how can he win using only what is provided by nature and luck? He has been on this path for 20 years now, and is considered by many to be a living saint.

**Combat Encounters:** Creighton is friendly with many adventuring parties and city governments. He often travels as a group member, friend of a dignitary, or emissary, and comes to the aid of those who seem worthy.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Creighton is not like other dwarves. Tranquil in conversation, he is a riot of emotion in battle, as he tries to fuse with the world's primal nature.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk prefers to ambush foes, and uses his diamond body ability to poison either his spear or at least two javelins without risk to himself.

**During Combat** The monk prefers to fight from horseback, and uses Ride-By Attack and [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge) to hit foes so he faces little risk of retaliation. He often uses Stunning Fist on the first pass, and if successful follows with a Spirited Charge. Against other mounted foes, he uses Improved Trip to unhorse his opponents if possible.

### Asim the Crimson Bandit

Asim's family had a long tradition of robbing travelers, but he was determined to end that life, seeking out a monastery to remake himself. His riches went to the temple to fund good works, and he gave his expensive clothes to the poor. Yet when territorial changes found the monastery's lands full of invaders, he found himself leading the resistance. Often this war requires robbing the supply trains of his enemies, and what Asim steals he splits between the poor and the war effort.

**Combat Encounters:** Asim is rarely without several fellow monks. He is always wary, and would rather question an incapacitated foe than fall for an enemy's trap.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** More than anything, Asim wants to return to the peaceful life of an ascetic.

**Special Attacks** +1 on attack rolls against goblinoid and reptilian humanoids, flurry of blows, quivering palm (1/day, DC 22), stunning fist (17/day, DC 22)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk drinks his _potions of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_ and _ [protection from energy](spells/protectionFromEnergy.md#_protection-from-energy)_ (fire) if he has had time to study his foes' weaknesses. When fighting in cramped or narrow areas, he instead drinks his _potion of [invisibility](spells/invisibility.md#_invisibility)_ and coats an area of the floor with his _ [salve of slipperiness](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_salve-of-slipperiness)_. He then waits for foes to enter the greased area before attacking.

**During Combat** The monk uses his kama in conjunction with Spring Attack and Improved Trip to knock foes prone, potentially using the kama's _ [ki focus](magicItems/weapons.md#_weapons-ki-focus)_ special ability to channel his Stunning Fist. If he has successfully tripped foes with his _ [salve of slipperiness](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_salve-of-slipperiness)_, he activates his _ [slippers of spider climbing](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_slippers-of-spider-climbing) _so he doesn't have to cross the slippery floor, and uses flurry of blows with his shuriken. If outnumbered, he uses his _ [elemental gem](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_elemental-gem)_ and flanks with the earth elemental.

**Base Statistics** Without_ [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin)_ and _ [protection from energy](spells/protectionFromEnergy.md#_protection-from-energy)_, the monk's statistics are **Immune** disease, poison; **AC** 28, touch 24, flat-footed 25.

**During Combat** Against a single foe, the monk opens with Stunning Fist augmented with Improved [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike), then tries to grapple the stunned foe. Against multiple opponents, she uses flurry of blows to attempt trip and disarm maneuvers, making as many foes prone or weaponless as possible, then strikes when those opponents provoke attacks of opportunity. Against foes too large to grapple or immune to stunning, she uses her _ki_ pool to boost her movement, then Spring Attack with Improved [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike) to make hit and run attacks.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk prefers to challenge foes openly. He spends a point from his _ki_ pool to increase his speed.

**During Combat** The monk uses Great Cleave and [Lunge](feats.md#_lunge) in tandem, normally spending a point from his _ki_ pool to offset the Armor Class penalty of these two feats. The monk makes unarmed strikes, attempting to stun or stagger with Stunning Fist and then use Improved Bull Rush to push the enemy away. If overwhelmed, the monk drinks a _potion of [mirror image](spells/mirrorImage.md#_mirror-image)_ to confuse attackers, uses Spring Attack or Great Cleave to attack multiple opponents as a standard action, then moves away quickly. The monk always leaves 2 points in his _ki _pool so he can use abundant step if he's severely threatened.

Some elven monks master the art of carnage with one chosen weapon. Sword savants are particularly adept at keeping their foes at a distance until it's time to land the killing blow.

### Ehtyar Nasta

No one wields a sword the way that Ehtyar Nasta does. His movements are like the wind, his thrusts like fire, and his parries like stone. One of the rare weapon masters of the age, Ehtyar uses his art to protect the world from the horrors that live beyond reality. He is especially wary of the machinations of the creatures of the Shadow Plane, and travels that plane pursuing one conspiracy or another. When not on a mission, he does fighting form demonstrations for the enlightenment and entertainment of the young.

**Combat Encounters:** Ehtyar is at his most tense when chasing creatures of the Shadow Plane. He's often paranoid of strangers, who he believes his enemies use to get close to him.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Ifhe's in a place of safety, this elf is calm, helpful, and very generous with his time. When stressed, he is unyielding, overly cautious, and curt.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The monk drinks his _potions of [barkskin](spells/barkskin.md#_barkskin) _and _ [bear's endurance](spells/bearSEndurance.md#_bear-s-endurance)_.

**During Combat** The monk expends a point from his _ki_ pool at the beginning of combat to increase his speed. He then closes with a single opponent to deliver an Improved [Vital Strike](feats.md#_vital-strike) combined with Stunning Fist. If successful, he makes a full attack with his flurry of blows in the next round, attempting to finish the hampered opponent. He uses this tactic whenever possible, using flurry of blows or [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack) only against targets that have already had their AC compromised from being stunned or tripped. Otherwise, he uses his mobility and high [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) skill to move in and out of melee. When fighting four or more opponents, the monk activates his _ [feather token](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_feather-token)_ (whip) and targets spellcasters first with Stunning Fist combined with Medusa's Wrath.

Ageless masters prefer to spread wisdom, but once roused they are dangerous opponents.

### Oyonchol

Master Oyonchol spends most of his time on a high pillar on the side of a trade route in the middle of a desolate steppe. Pilgrims leave offerings at its base, and sometimes young monks camp under the pillar, hoping to gain wisdom. Most are disappointed, and at least one has died of exposure while Master Oyonchol sat silently pondering the changing seasons.
