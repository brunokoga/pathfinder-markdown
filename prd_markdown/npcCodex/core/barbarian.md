### Dorremera Salin

Dorremera is a child of the waves, sired by an aquatic elf who abandoned her human mother. Raised along the sea, Dorremera took to the water as if born to it, and considers the beasts of the sea and shore her kin. She has little patience for the niceties of society—whether human or elven—and lashes out at almost everyone who crosses her path.

**Combat Encounters:** Dorremera has no compunctions about stealing from landlubbers, or killing those who chase or surprise her.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Though it is hard to get through to her, Dorremera sometimes parleys with adventuring groups that treat her respectfully, show great battle prowess, or are particularly kind to sea creatures.

**Special Attacks** rage (24 rounds/day), rage powers (clear mind, internal fortitude, raging climber +10, rolling dodge +2, superstition +4)

Tactics

**During Combat** The barbarian uses [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) and [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) to rain death upon enemies from above. She snipes from cover or concealment to begin her attack, but after that is concerned solely with maximizing the intensity of her deadly barrage. She activates her rolling dodge to evade enemy counterfire.

Rare tribes of halfling cannibals stalk deep jungles in search of sentient prey.

### Lanani Shabu

When newcomers objecting to his matriarchal tribe's cannibalistic ways wiped out his kin, Lanani had no choice but to ritualistically take on new leadership—and a new gender. Now "Mother Lanani" hunts the jungle, punishing humans and recruiting halflings to her new tribe.

**Combat Encounters:** Lanani can stalk quarry for days, slowly weakening those she is not able to knock out with her poison. Other times, she heads a hunting band.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Lanani rarely interacts with the outside world, but in desperate times she ventures into civilization to lure prey closer to her tribe.

**Special Attacks** greater rage (26 rounds/day), rage powers (animal fury, increased damage reduction +1, no escape, raging leaper +11, superstition +4)

Tactics

**During Combat** The barbarian charges into the heart of battle, using one end of his double axe two-handed when charging or moving, and switching back to a double weapon grip when making full attacks. He uses his leaping and [Acrobatics](skills/acrobatics.md#_acrobatics) to enter melee quickly, using his no escape ability to chase down cowards.

This half-orc barbarian savagely rips though weaker opponents with unquenchable bloodlust.

### Graun Quor

Graun the pit fighter was raised in lawless borderlands where control changed hands frequently and unpredictably. The one constant was the thirst for blood sports, and any youth with a hard edge and more greed and ambition than fear could make a name and a fortune so long as he survived. Graun mastered many weapons throughout his career, but loves best the orc double axe he took as a prize in an early championship bout. Having long since bought his freedom, Graun wanders the borderlands selling his skills to the highest bidder. A few orc tribes have offered Graun leadership roles, but he has little patience for such things and cares nothing for the welfare of his allies.

**Combat Encounters:** Graun can be found at the head of an orc band on rare occasions, either a tribe he has adopted for a short time or who serve as fodder for his hunts. Other times he stalks the wild lands looking for opponents worthy of his fighting skills.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Graun sometimes ventures into civilized lands to spend his coin and search for blood sports, hoping for a chance to kill in front of a crowd.

**Special Attacks** +1 on attack rolls against goblinoid and orc humanoids, greater rage (31 rounds/day), rage powers (guarded stance +3, mighty swing, no escape, roused anger, strength surge +12, unexpected strike)

Tactics

**During Combat** The barbarian switches from a one-handed to a two-handed grip on his axe as the situation demands. He uses his shield against multiple foes but keeps his bow in hand if in melee against a lone enemy. He uses his rolling dodge before exposing himself to missiles, especially giant-hurled boulders, and assumes his guarded stance in melee. He charges with Spring Attack to get close to his enemies, following it up with full attacks.

**Base Statistics** When not raging, the barbarian's statistics are **AC** 25, touch 13, flat-footed 23; **hp** 155; **Fort** +14, **Will** +7; **Melee** _+1 giant-bane dwarven waraxe_ +16/+11/+6 (1d10+4/×3); **Ranged** mwk composite longbow +14/+9/+4 (1d8+3/×3); **Str** 16, **Con** 20; **CMB** +15; **CMD** 28 (32 vs. bull rush or trip); **Skills** [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) +7, [Swim](skills/swim.md#_swim) +7.

Giant slayers seek out giants and cut them down. Raging with enmity for their prey, they allow no other creatures to get between them and their hated foes.

### Jemar Crowell

Jemar Crowell is a champion of his people, a savage emissary of vengeance in the never-ending wars between the dwarfholds and giant-kin of all kinds. Often clad head to toe in stout dwarven steel armor, Jemar sometimes doffs his helmet to better taunt enemies as he brings them low. He keeps his scalp shaved save for two narrow crests of hair. His cape is woven from shaggy skeins of loosely-spun giant hair clipped from his vanquished foes, and when the weather is cold he wears scarves and mittens knit from the same material.

**Combat Encounters:** Jemar is a focused combatant, going after his prey and protecting his people's interests to the exclusion of all other concerns. He has no qualms about stealing kills and looting bodies.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** When not slaying giants, Jemar plans raids on giant strongholds, and considers those who trade with giants as bad as giants themselves. Though he primarily works for dwarven interests, he often hires sellswords and adventurers to aid him on particularly dangerous hunts.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The barbarian uses his warhorse for transportation, but if expecting combat, he retrieves an animal from his _ [bag of tricks](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_bag-of-tricks)_ and rides it instead.

**During Combat** The barbarian charges whenever possible, whether mounted or on foot, using [Mounted Combat](feats.md#_mounted-combat) and his _+1 [arrow catching](magicItems/armor.md#_armor-arrow-catching) buckler_ to divert attacks made against his mount. If his mount is slain, he draws a replacement from his _ [bag of tricks](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_bag-of-tricks)_ and makes a fast mount. He uses guarded stance and rolling dodge as needed, often using them or renewed vigor after a ride-by charge while circling around into position for another charge.

Savage riders use a mix of magical and mundane mounts to make lightning-fast raids against their enemies.

### Finnogh Llew

Having mastered horses while still a child, Finnogh seeks out the wildest and most untameable beasts the world has to offer. Though he's keenly interested in learning which savage beasts can best be tamed, he cares less about mastery than the thrill of the ride. Eventually he turns loose even those animals he has broken to the bit, though more from boredom than altruism.

**Combat Encounters:** Always on the search for exotic beasts to serve as mounts, Finnogh often resides in or near the lairs of strange creatures.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Finnogh is quick to query adventurers about any strange creatures they might have encountered, and may join them on a hunt for such beasts.

Tactics

**Before Combat** The barbarian uses her _wand of [shield](spells/shield.md#_shield)_ before most battles, but also uses her _wand of [mirror image](spells/mirrorImage.md#_mirror-image)_ if she expects a difficult fight or a battle against a strong lone enemy.

**During Combat** The barbarian closes quickly to make full attacks with her hooked hammer, using the _ [thundering](magicItems/weapons.md#_thundering) pick_ end as her primary weapon and the hammer as her off-hand attack. If she has to charge or otherwise move between attacks, she makes a single two-handed [Power Attack](feats.md#_power-attack) with the pick end. She uses moment of clarity to trigger a wand or scroll if the situation demands, such as in an encounter with a flying or invisible foe. She prefers to reserve her _ [boots of speed](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_boots-of-speed)_ for when she is already in melee, to facilitate full attacks or to close the distance on faster enemies.

**Base Statistics** When not raging, the barbarian's statistics are **AC** 21, touch 14, flat-footed 18; **hp** 149; **Fort** +13, **Will** +6; no bonus vs. enchantments; **Immune** —; **Melee** _+1 [thundering](magicItems/weapons.md#_thundering) gnome hooked hammer_ +18/+13/+8 (1d4+4/19–20/×4) or _+1 [thundering](magicItems/weapons.md#_thundering) gnome hooked hammer _+16/+11/+6 (1d4+3/19–20/×4), _+1 gnome hooked hammer_ +16/+11 (1d6+3/19–20/×3); **Ranged** mwk composite longbow +19/+14/+9 (1d6+2/×3); **Str** 14, **Con** 16; **CMB** +15; **CMD** 28; **Skills** [Climb](skills/climb.md#_climb) +3.

An oddity among their kind, arcane experimenters use knowledge of magic to sow confusion on the battlefield.

### Krida Grichenwald

Krida studies the link between emotional states and magic. Though she's so far been unable to focus her rage into magic, she believes it is only a matter of time. When friends and family tried to dissuade her, Krida quite literally sacrificed them, murdering some swiftly in paranoid vengeance but gruesomely torturing others in her search for non-existent magical secrets.

**Combat Encounters:** Krida's obsession drives her to attack those who obviously possess magic items.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Krida may search out spellcasters in order to pick their brains about rage magic, but she soon becomes frustrated and hostile to them.

**Special Attacks** greater rage (35 rounds/day), rage powers (low-light vision, mighty swing, night vision, quick reflexes, scent, strength surge +15, superstition +5)

Tactics

**Before Combat** The barbarian uses stealth and deception to get close to enemies without them noticing, and uses his _ [chime of opening](magicItems/wondrousItems.md#_chime-of-opening)_ to break into locked strongholds.

**During Combat** The barbarian tries to disarm opponents at the beginning of combat, using poison against a target's weakest ability score if he knows his target in advance. He triggers his mighty swing on a sword critical that might slay his target, and uses his rage-enhanced senses to find creatures trying to hide or flee. He uses his buckler when faced with many foes, but against lone targets uses his _ [nine lives stealer](magicItems/weapons.md#_nine-lives-stealer)_ for two-handed Power Attacks.

**Combat Encounters:** Xavier often hires goons to weaken his prey before moving in for the kill.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Xavier disguises himself so he can interact with marks in person and learn about them.

Whether encountered alone or in a group of like-minded individuals, undead hunters let no one stand in the way of their grim work.

### Torain Mirno

The last survivor of a half-orc tribe exterminated by a necromancer, Torain has devoted his life to cleansing the world of the taint of the unliving. His studious nature is a rarity among half-orcs, particularly in light of the savagery he unleashes upon the deathless hordes. While some hail him as a hero, his endless war has all but extinguished his sense of compassion and mercy.

**Combat Encounters:** Torain strikes hard and fast against those he believes serve undead or necromantic masters, often killing them before asking questions.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Between undead hunts, Torain holds silent vigils in a cemeteries and mausoleums, acting as a fierce and watchful warden against the rising dead.

### Sibusiswe Njai

Sibusiswe is a fierce and feral elf with the grace of a panther, and claims that she communes with animistic spirits of the forest and savannah. A loner, she prowls the wildlands, appearing and disappearing like a flash of lightning.

**Combat Encounters:** Sibusiswe follows the dictates of the animalistic spirits that she believes guide her. Because of this, her attacks can be unprovoked—as much as a surprise to her as to her victims.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Sibusiswe's spirits are capricious, but also inquisitive. An encounter with the elf is just as likely to end in a parley as it is to end in combat.

In close combat, he uses intimidating glare along with Great Cleave attacks, using knockback to force enemies into close quarters.

### Gorgu Stonesplitter

Once an ordinary dwarven warrior, Gorgu Stonesplitter was captured and enslaved by fire giants who shaved his beard, and burned and scarred his face. After years of toil in their mines, he gained his freedom when the giants' king was overthrown by a group of adventurers. Gorgu threw his lot in with them in the hope of taking his revenge on the giants' masters. While he learned much, killing could not restore his pride or his faith in his people, nor slake the rage in his heart. Since taking his leave from his companions, he has roamed the world in search of purpose. He fights now for the fun of it, and his temper has gradually cooled to dark embers. Still, he might join any nearby fray on any side. Should anyone land a blow he notices, he might begin to fight in earnest.

**Combat Encounters:** A glutton for battle, Gorgu fights for anyone or any cause that might offer a challenge.

**Roleplaying Suggestions:** Every so often, Gorgu seeks out powerful adventurers to lead him to an impossible foe—which he secretly plans to take down single-handedly.
