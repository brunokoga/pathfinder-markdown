				<h1 id="sorcerer" class="monster-header">Sorcerer</h1>
				
				
				<p>Sorcerous power is, by its very nature, a strange and unpredictable thing, the result of mysterious magical heritages and the intermingling of creatures both legendary and mundane. With the magical legacies flowing through their veins, sorcerers can undertake great works capable of placing them forever in the halls of heroes&mdash;or laying waste to all around them. </p>
				<p>The following section introduces new sorcerer bloodlines, as well as two new sorcerer archetypes&mdash;crossblooded and wildblooded&mdash;the latter of which comes with its own unique selection of modified bloodlines to reflect its bizarre and mutated origins.</p>
				<h1 id="bloodlines">Bloodlines</h1>
				<h2 id="accursed">Accursed</h2>
				<p>Misfortune, pestilence, and nightmares follow your family like vermin drawn to carrion. Somewhere in your family history, a hag's foul influence entered your bloodline. You may actually be related to the hag, or you may still be suffering the effects of a curse that a hag laid upon your kin in generations past. Now the hag's powers are part of your heritage.</p>

				<p id="dream-walking"><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dream.html#_dream" >Dream</a> Walking (Sp)</i>: At 15th level, you can enter the ethereal plane. This functions like <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/etherealJaunt.html#_ethereal-jaunt" >ethereal jaunt</a></i>, but with a duration of 1 minute for every 2 sorcerer levels you possess. Once during this trip, you may cast <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/nightmare.html#_nightmare" >nightmare</a></i> as a spell-like ability on a creature you see on the Material Plane. (This is an exception to the normal rule that ethereal creatures cannot affect targets on the Material Plane).</p>

				<p>The spiritual power of art and song runs strongly through your family line. This may be the result of ancient pacts made with azata patrons, or even an inheritance from a lillend or trumpet archon ancestor. It could also be the lingering taint of a less savory heritage, such as from a harpy or a forefather driven to madness by the disquieting gibbering of a shoggoth. However it came to be, your family's artistic bent shows itself strongly in your magic.</p>

				<h1 id="crossblooded-(archetype)">Crossblooded (Archetype)</h1>
				<p>A crossblooded bloodline combines the powers of two distinct heritages. In most cases, sorcerers with this bloodline are the offspring of two sorcerers from different ancestries, but occasionally a crossblooded sorcerer arises from the conjunction of other powers. A draconic sorcerer who is also the culmination of a great destiny, an abyssal sorcerer from a family that dealt with devils, and an arcane sorcerer raised from birth by fey are all possible sources for crossblooded bloodlines.</p>
				<p>A crossblooded sorcerer selects two different bloodlines. The sorcerer may gain access to the skills, feats, and some of the powers of both bloodlines she is descended from, but at the cost of reduced mental clarity and choice (see Drawbacks).</p>
				<p id="class-skill"><b>Class Skill</b>: A crossblooded sorcerer receives the bonus class skill from both of her bloodlines. If these are the same skill, this does not grant any additional benefit.</p>
				<p id="bonus-spells"><b>Bonus Spells</b>: A crossblooded sorcerer may select her bonus spells from either of her bloodlines. The sorcerer also has the choice to learn a lower-level bonus spell she did not choose in place of the higher-level bonus spell she would normally gain. Lower-level bonus spells learned this way always use the spell level that they would be if the sorcerer had learned them with the appropriate bonus spell.</p>
				<p id="example"><i>Example</i>: A 3rd-level aberrant/abyssal crossblooded sorcerer has the choice of learning <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/causeFear.html#_cause-fear" >cause fear</a></i> or <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person" >enlarge person</a></i> as her bloodline bonus spell. If she selected <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/causeFear.html#_cause-fear" >cause fear</a></i> as her 3rd-level bonus spell, at 5th level she could use her new bonus spell to learn <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person" >enlarge person</a></i> instead of <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/bullSStrength.html#_bull-s-strength" >bull's strength</a></i> or <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/seeInvisibility.html#_see-invisibility" >see invisibility</a></i>, and she would add it to her list of 1st-level spells known (just as if she had learned it as her 3rd-level bonus spell).</p>
				<p id="bonus-feat"><b>Bonus Feat</b>: A crossblooded sorcerer combines the bonus feat lists from both of her bloodlines and may select her bloodline bonus feats from this combined list.</p>
				<p id="bloodline-arcana"><b>Bloodline Arcana</b>: A crossblooded sorcerer gains the bloodline arcana of both her bloodlines.</p>
				<p id="bloodline-powers"><b>Bloodline Powers</b>: At 1st, 3rd, 9th, 15th, and 20th levels, a crossblooded sorcerer gains one of the two new bloodline powers available to her at that level. She may instead select a lower-level bloodline power she did not choose in place of one of these higher-level powers.</p>
				<p id="drawbacks"><b>Drawbacks</b>: A crossblooded sorcerer has one fewer spell known at each level (including cantrips) than is presented on the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/classes/sorcerer.html#_table-3-15-sorcerer-spells-known">sorcerer spells known table</a>. Furthermore, the conflicting urges created by the divergent nature of the crossblooded sorcerer's dual heritage forces her to constantly take some mental effort just to remain focused on her current situation and needs. This leaves her with less mental resolve to deal with external threats. A crossblooded sorcerer always takes a &ndash;2 penalty on Will saves.</p>
				<h1 id="wildblooded-(archetype)">Wildblooded (Archetype)</h1>
				<p>A wildblooded sorcerer has a mutated version of a more common bloodline, with one arcana and at least one bloodline power that are different from those of an unmutated bloodline. When creating a wildblooded sorcerer, select an existing bloodline, then select one of the following mutated bloodlines associated with that bloodline. Use the normal bloodline's class skill, bonus spells, and bonus feats, and the mutated bloodline's bloodline arcana. Use the normal bloodline's bloodline powers, except when the mutated bloodline replaces one of those powers.</p>
				<h2 id="anarchic">Anarchic</h2>
				<p>Your magical power taps into pure anarchy.</p>
				<p id="associated-bloodline"><b>Associated Bloodline</b>: Protean.</p>
				<p id="bloodline-arcana"><b>Bloodline Arcana</b>: Whenever you fail a concentration check to cast a spell, a cantrip effect is created.

				<p id="wild-feedback"><i>Wild Feedback (Su)</i>: At 3rd level, when you successfully dispel or counterspell an opponent's spell, the caster (if it is within 100 feet) takes 1d6 points of damage +1 per level of the spell affected. This bloodline power replaces protean resistances.</p>
