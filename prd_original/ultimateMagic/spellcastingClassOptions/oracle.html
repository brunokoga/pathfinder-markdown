				<h1 id="oracle" class="monster-header">Oracle</h1>
				
				
				<p>Not all vessels of the divine choose their path. Rather, some find themselves chosen, raised to a life of power and responsibility by forces they themselves may not understand. These are the oracles, agents gifted by providence and serving not a single deity, but rather many sources, venerating and drawing magic from all those patron deities who support their ideals. Whether a curse or a gift, the strange powers and unsettling mysteries of the oracles make them forces to be reckoned with, both in the halls of power and on the fields of battle.</p>
				<p>This section introduces new oracle mysteries. Following these mysteries are six new oracle archetypes. Each archetype includes a list of recommended mysteries that are particularly suitable for that archetype, though the archetypes are not limited only to oracles of those mysteries. An archetype's bonus spells replace the normal bonus spells for the oracle's chosen mystery.</p>
				<h1 id="mysteries">Mysteries</h1>
				<p>The following are new mysteries for oracles. An oracle must pick one mystery upon taking her first level of oracle. Once made, this choice cannot be changed. Unless otherwise noted, the DC to save against these revelations is equal to 10 + 1/2 the oracle's class level + the oracle's Charisma modifier. Effects that duplicate spells use the oracle's class level as her caster level.</p>

				<p id="revelations"><b>Revelations</b>: An oracle with the time mystery can choose from any of the following revelations.</p>
				<p id="aging-touch"><i>Aging Touch (Su)</i>: Your touch ages living creatures and objects. As a melee touch attack, you can deal 1 point of Strength damage for every two oracle levels you possess to living creatures. Against objects or constructs, you can deal 1d6 points of damage per oracle level. If used against an object in another creature's possession, treat this attack as a sunder combat maneuver. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day for every five oracle levels you possess.</p>
				<p id="erase-from-time"><i>Erase from Time (Su)</i>: As a melee touch attack, you can temporarily remove a creature from time altogether. The target creature must make a Fortitude save or vanish completely for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level (minimum 1 round). No magic or divinations can detect the creature during this time, as it exists outside of time and space&mdash;in effect, the creature ceases to exist for the duration of this ability. At the end of the duration, the creature reappears unharmed in the space it last occupied (or the nearest possible space, if the original space is now occupied). You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 11th level.</p>
				<p id="knowledge-of-the-ages"><i>Knowledge of the Ages (Su)</i>: You can search through time to recall some bit of forgotten lore or information. You can retry any <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> skill check you have made within the past minute, gaining an insight bonus on the check equal to your Charisma modifier. You can use this ability a number times per day equal to your Charisma modifier.</p>
				<p id="momentary-glimpse"><i>Momentary Glimpse (Su)</i>: Once per day, you can gain a glimpse into your immediate future.

At 5th level, and every four levels thereafter, you can use this ability one additional time per day.</p>
				<p id="rewind-time"><i>Rewind Time (Su)</i>: Once per day<span class="char-style-override-39"> </span>as an immediate action, you can reroll any one d20 roll that you have just made before the results of the roll are revealed.

You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and 17th level. You must be at least 7th level before selecting this revelation.</p>
				<p id="temporal-celerity"><i>Temporal Celerity (Su)</i>: Whenever you roll for initiative, you can roll twice and take either result. At 7th level, you can always act in the surprise round, but if you fail to notice the ambush, you act last, regardless of your initiative result (you act in the normal order in following rounds).

You can use this ability for 1 minute per oracle level that you possess per day. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-minute increments. At 7th level, each time you activate this ability, you can treat it as the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/blink.html#_blink" >blink</a></i> spell, though each round spent this way counts as 1 minute of your normal time flicker duration. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
				<p id="time-hop"><i>Time Hop (Su)</i>: As a move action, you can teleport up to 10 feet per oracle level that you possess per day. This teleportation must be used in 5-foot increments. This movement does not provoke attacks of opportunity. You must have line of sight to your destination to use this ability. You can bring other willing creatures with you, but you must expend an equal amount of distance for each creature brought. You must be at least 7th level to select this revelation.</p>

At 18th level, this functions like <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/foresight.html#_foresight" >foresight</a></i>.

				<p id="final-revelation"><b>Final Revelation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a true master of time and stop aging.

You cannot die of old age, but you can be killed or die through accident, disease, poison, or other external effects.

				<p id="lignification"><i>Lignification (Su)</i>: Once per day, you can turn a creature into wood. As a standard action, you may direct your gaze against a single creature within 30 feet. The targeted creature (along with all its carried gear) must make a Fortitude save or turn into a mindless, inert statue made out of wood for a number of rounds equal to 1/2 your oracle level. This ability otherwise functions as a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/fleshToStone.html#_flesh-to-stone" >flesh to stone</a> </i>spell, except the target turns to wood instead of stone. This can be reverse by any effect that can reverse <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/fleshToStone.html#_flesh-to-stone" >flesh to stone</a></i>.

This functions as the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/stoneTell.html#_stone-tell" >stone tell</a></i> spell, except with wood instead of stones.

You must be at least 11th level to select this revelation.</p>
				<p id="thorn-burst"><i>Thorn Burst (Su)</i>: As a swift action, you can cause sharp splinters of wood to explode outward from your body. These splinters deal 1d6 points of piercing damage per two oracle levels (minimum 1d6) to all creatures within a 10-foot burst. A Reflex save halves this damage. In addition, the sharp splinters count as <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/equipment.html#_adventuring-gear">caltrops</a> in the area until your next turn. You can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
				<p id="tree-form"><i>Tree Form (Sp)</i>: As a standard action, you can assume the form of a Large living or dead tree or shrub, as <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/treeShape.html#_tree-shape" >tree shape</a></i>. At 9th level, you can assume the form of a Small or Medium plant creature, as <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/plantShape.html#_plant-shape-i" >plant shape I</a></i>.

You can use this ability once per day, but the duration is 1 hour/level. You must be at least 3rd level to select this revelation.</p>
				<p id="wood-armor"><i>Wood Armor (Su)</i>: You can conjure wooden armor around yourself, which grants you a +4 armor bonus. At 7th level, and every four levels thereafter, this bonus increases by +2. At 13th level, this armor grants you DR 5/slashing. You can use this armor for 1 hour per day per oracle level. This duration does not need to be consecutive, but it must be spent in 1-hour increments. The armor vanishes if you remove it.</p>
				<p id="wood-bond"><i>Wood Bond (Ex)</i>: Your mystical bond with wood is such that your weapons become an extension of your body. You gain a +1 competence bonus on attack rolls when wielding a weapon made of or mostly consisting of wood (such as a bow, club, quarterstaff, or spear). This bonus increases by +1 at 5th level and every five levels thereafter.</p>
				<p id="wood-sight"><i>Wood Sight (Su)</i>: As a move action, you can alter your vision to see through underbrush and plant growth that would normally grant concealment, up to a range of 60 feet (though darkness and other obstacles still may block your sight). At 7th level, you can use this ability to see through wood or other plant material as easily as if it were transparent glass, penetrating a number of feet of wood equal to your oracle level. You can use this ability a number of rounds per day equal to your oracle level, but these rounds do not need to be consecutive.</p>
				<p id="wooden-weapon"><i>Wooden Weapon (Su)</i>: You can create a wooden club, quarterstaff, longspear, shortspear, or spear that lasts for 1 minute for every oracle level you possess.

At 11th level, the weapon gains the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-keen" >keen</a></i> weapon property (or the equivalent increase to its critical threat range, if it is a bludgeoning weapon). You can use this ability a number of times per day equal to 3 + your Charisma modifier.</p>
				<p id="woodland-stride"><i>Woodland Stride (Ex)</i>: You can move through any sort of undergrowth (such as natural thorns, briars, overgrown areas, and similar terrain) at your normal speed and without taking damage or suffering any other impairment. Thorns, briars, and overgrown areas that have been magically manipulated to impede motion, however, still affect you.</p>
				<p id="final-revelation"><b>Final Revelation</b>: Upon reaching 20th level, you become a living creature of wood. You are forevermore treated as the plant type rather than your original type for the purpose of spells and magical effects. Your skin takes on the appearance of polished wood grain, and you gain a +4 natural armor bonus to your Armor Class and damage reduction 10/&mdash; against wooden weapons or any natural attacks made by a wooden or woodlike creature. You gain immunity to paralysis, poison, polymorph, sleep, and stunning. At will, you can meld with any tree or single block of wood (as <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/meldIntoStone.html#_meld-into-stone" >meld into stone</a></i>, except wood only, and with no limit to how long you can remain in the wood).</p>

				<p id="oracle's-curse"><b>Oracle's Curse</b>: A dual-cursed oracle must choose two curses at 1st level.

The other curse comes with its normal benefits.</p>
				<p id="class-skills"><b>Class Skills</b>: A dual-cursed oracle gains no additional class skills from her mystery.</p>

				<p id="final-revelation"><b>Final Revelation</b>: At 20th level, you become an extraplanar creature. Choose one outer plane, such as Heaven or the Abyss. You gain superficial physical characteristics as appropriate to natives of your chosen outer plane. For example, if your chosen plane is Heaven, you gain angelic features such as a halo and metallic skin. This change does not alter your Hit Dice, hit points, saving throws, skill points, class skills, or proficiencies. Your type changes to “outsider (extraplanar),” except on your associated plane, where your type is “outsider (native).” In addition, you gain immunity to your associated energy type and gain damage reduction 10/magic.
