<h1 id="traits" id="traits">Traits</h1>
<p>Character traits are abilities that are not tied to your race or class. They can enhance your skills, racial abilities, class abilities, or other statistics, allowing you further customization.</p>

<h2 id="basic-traits">Basic Traits</h2>
<p>Basic traits are broken down into four categories. Combat traits focus on martial and physical aspects of your background. Faith traits focus on your religious and philosophical leanings. Magic traits focus on any magical events or training you have had. Social traits focus on your social class or upbringing.</p>


<h3 id="combat-traits">Combat Traits</h3>
<p>These traits are associated with combat, battle, and physical prowess. They give minor bonuses in battle and represent conflicts and physical struggles in your backstory.</p>
<p><b>Anatomist</b>: You have studied the workings of anatomy, either as a student at university or as an apprentice mortician or necromancer. You know where to aim your blows to strike vital organs. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all rolls made to confirm critical hits.</p>
<p><b>Armor Expert</b>: You have worn armor as long as you can remember, either as part of your training to become a knight's squire or simply because you were seeking to emulate a hero. Your childhood armor wasn't the real thing as far as protection, but it did encumber you as much as real armor would have, and you've grown used to moving in such suits with relative grace. When you wear armor of any sort, reduce that suit's armor check penalty by 1, to a minimum check penalty of 0.</p>
<p><b>Axe to Grind</b>: There is a fire in your heart that can't be quenched. You gain a +1 trait bonus on damage against foes who are threatened by only you.</p>
<p><b>Battlefield Disciple</b>: You are skilled at supporting your allies in the heat of battle. You gain a +2 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/heal.html#_heal" >Heal</a> checks made to stabilize a dying creature. In addition, when you successfully use the aid another action in combat to grant an ally a bonus on her next attack roll, the bonus you grant increases by 1.</p>
<p><b>Black Powder Bravado</b>: You are particularly successful when using deeds. Once per day, when you perform a deed that requires an attack roll and you miss with that roll, you can reroll it. You must take the second result even if it is worse.</p>
<p><b>Black Powder Fortune</b>: You have little to fear when there's a gun in your hand. As long as you are wielding a firearm, you gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against curse, fear, and emotion effects.</p>
<p><b>Black Powder Interjection</b>: Your confidence rises when you foil spellcasting. Once per day, when you interrupt the casting of a spell with a firearm attack, you may regain 1 grit point.</p>
<p><b>Bloodthirsty</b>: You have a vicious streak, and nothing satisfies you more than warm blood on your hands and blade. Whenever you make an attack that reduces a foe to 0 hit points or fewer or you confirm a critical hit, your attack deals 1 additional point of damage. The additional damage is a trait bonus, and is multiplied by your weapon's critical hit multiplier.</p>
<p><b>Bullied</b>: You were bullied often as a child, and you are now constantly ready to defend yourself with your fists when an enemy comes near. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls made with unarmed strikes. Note that this trait does not grant the ability to make attacks of opportunity with your unarmed strikes&mdash;you must have a level in monk, the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike" >Improved Unarmed Strike</a> feat, or some other similar power to gain the use of this character trait. However, that doesn't prevent you from selecting this trait. You simply cannot make use of it until a later point if you do.</p>
<p><b>Cold and Calculating</b>: You are adept at tricking favored enemies of your race or those related to your race. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/bluff.html#_bluff" >Bluff</a> checks against favored enemies that share one of your subtypes. You also gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls made against such favored enemies during the surprise round.</p>
<p><b>Courageous</b>: Your childhood was brutal, but you persevered through force of will and faith. No matter how hard things got, you knew you'd make it through as long as you kept a level head. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear effects.</p>
<p><b>Dedicated Defender</b>: When a companion is down, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls and on checks made to overcome spell resistance while you are adjacent to a dying or disabled ally, animal companion, eidolon, familiar, or mount.</p>
<p><b>Deft Dodger</b>: Growing up in a rough neighborhood or a dangerous environment has honed your senses. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Reflex saves.</p>
<p><b>Dirty Fighter</b>: You wouldn't have lived to make it out of childhood without the aid of a sibling, friend, or companion you could always count on to distract your enemies long enough for you to do a little bit more damage than normal. That companion may be another PC or an NPC (who may even be recently departed from your side). When you hit a foe you are flanking, you deal 1 additional point of damage (this damage is added to your base damage, and is multiplied on a critical hit). This additional damage is a trait bonus.</p>
<p><b>Dispelled Battler</b>: When deprived of magic, you fight harder. You gain a +1 trait bonus on weapon attack and damage rolls while within an area of antimagic such as that created by an <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/antimagicField.html#_antimagic-field" >antimagic field</a></i>. You also gain this bonus for 1 round after you are subject to an area or targeted <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a></i> spell, regardless of the effect's success or failure in dispelling your spells and magical effects.</p>
<p><b>Easy Way or the Hard Way</b>: You are skilled at subduing your enemies. Whenever you attack one of your favored enemies with a weapon that deals lethal damage and choose to deal nonlethal damage, you take only a &mdash;2 penalty on the attack roll instead of the normal &mdash;4.</p>
<p><b>Evasive Sting</b>: Larger enemies have a hard time striking you. You gain a +1 dodge bonus to AC against enemies that are both your favored enemy and at least two size categories larger than you.</p>
<p><b>Faith's Hunter</b>: Divine powers smile upon you each time you grievously wound a favored enemy. When you confirm a critical hit against a favored enemy, you may extend the duration of any divine spell affecting you by 1 round. The benefits from multiple critical hits stack. Divine spells with an instantaneous duration can't be extended in this manner.</p>
<p><b>Fencer</b>: You trained with blades for long hours as a youth, either taking lessons in the genteel art of fencing from tutors paid for by your parents or being taken under the wing of a disenfranchised fencer who may have turned to a life of crime. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack of opportunity attack rolls made with daggers, swords, and similar bladed weapons.</p>
<p><b>Hidden Hand</b>: Your concealed weapons strike fast and true. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> checks made to conceal light weapons and a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls when making an attack with a light weapon during a surprise round.</p>
<p><b>Hunter's Knack</b>: When you watch and wait before attacking, your strike is true. You gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against your favored enemies when you make such attacks as part of a readied action.</p>
<p><b>Indelible Ire</b>: When you are gravely wounded, you're stirred to greater combat focus. Each time a critical hit is confirmed against you, you gain a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls for 1 round.</p>
<p><b>Just Like New</b>: Broken firearms are not problems&mdash;they are challenges. Your first attempt to remove the broken condition from your starting firearm and to upgrade it to a masterwork weapon costs 150 gp instead of 300 gp. In addition, when wielding a firearm that has the broken condition or is treated as if it had the broken condition, you take a &mdash;1 penalty on attack rolls made with it instead of the normal &mdash;2.</p>
<p><b>Killer</b>: You made your first kill at a very young age and found the task of war or murder to your liking. You either take particular pride in a well-placed blow, or find vile pleasure in twisting the blade to maximize your target's pain. You deal an amount of additional damage equal to your weapon's critical hit modifier when you score a successful critical hit with a weapon; this additional damage is added to the final total, and is not multiplied by the critical hit multiple itself. This extra damage is a trait bonus.</p>
<p><b>Kin Guardian</b>: You are dedicated to defending members of your family. When you use the aid another action to give a member of your family a bonus to AC, increase the bonus by 2. This increase is a trait bonus (and therefore doesn't stack with increases granted by other family members using this trait). This trait has no effect when using the aid another action to increase a family member's next attack roll.</p>
<p><b>Larger Than Life</b>: You wield firearms with truly terrifying menace. When you use the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate" >Intimidate</a> skill on a creature while wielding a firearm, you are considered one size category larger than your actual size.</p>
<p><b>Martial Performer</b>: Your training has made you a martial performer. When you gain a monk bonus feat, you may instead take a performance feat for which you meet the prerequisites.</p>
<p><b>Nature's Mimic</b>: Your knowledge of nature informs your fighting style, and that style gives you insight into related aspects of the natural world. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nature) checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nature) is always a class skill for you. You can make <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nature) checks pertaining to animals that correspond to your style feats untrained.</p>
<p><b>Never Stop Shooting</b>: Even when the chips are down, you keep on shooting. If your hit point total drops to 0 or lower but you are not dead, you may act as if disabled rather than dying (as if you possessed the Diehard feat). However, you can use your actions only to draw a firearm, reload a firearm, or attack with a firearm. If you have the Diehard feat, this trait also allows you to substitute your Wisdom score for your Constitution score for the purpose of determining the negative hit point total at which you die.</p>
<p><b>Reactionary</b>: You were bullied often as a child, but never quite developed an offensive response. Instead, you became adept at anticipating sudden attacks and reacting to danger quickly. You gain a +2 trait bonus on initiative checks.</p>
<p><b>Reckless</b>: You have a tendency for rash behavior, often disregarding your own safety as you move across the battlefield. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Reckless Contempt</b>: You do not fear the threat of lesser weapons. Whenever you provoke an attack of opportunity by firing a firearm, you gain a +1 trait bonus on the attack roll that provoked the attack of opportunity.</p>
<p><b>Resilient</b>: Growing up in a poor neighborhood or in the unforgiving wilds often forced you to subsist on food and water from doubtful sources. You've built up your constitution as a result, and gain a +1 trait bonus on Fortitude saves.</p>
<p><b>Resolve of the Rejected</b>: Some disagree with your choice to wield a firearm, and their scorn has only hardened your resolve in battle. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects. Also, once per day when you succeed at a saving throw against such an effect, you regain 1 grit point.</p>
<p><b>Scarred Descendant</b>: Your own people are your favored enemy. You gain a +1 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits against favored enemies of your own subtype and on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> checks made to track such creatures.</p>
<p><b>Startling Report</b>: Through either perfect timing or the determination of your action, the sound of your firearm going off sets your enemies on edge. When you shoot a firearm, you gain a +2 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate" >Intimidate</a> checks for 1 round against those who heard the shot.</p>
<p><b>Surprise Weapon</b>: You are skilled at fighting with objects not traditionally considered weapons. You gain a +2 trait bonus on attack rolls with improvised weapons.</p>
<p><b>Tactician</b>: You know how to take advantage of enemies who are unprepared for your assault. You gain a +1 trait bonus on initiative checks. In addition, once per day when you make an attack of opportunity, you gain a +2 trait bonus on the attack roll.</p>
<p><b>Unblemished Barrel</b>: Your skill with firearms speeds your repair of such weapons. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (weapons) checks, and it takes you only 30 minutes to remove the broken condition from a firearm.</p>
<p><b>Vigilant Battler</b>: You are hard to fool and harder to trick with a feint. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> checks. This trait bonus increases to +2 when used to counter a feint in combat.</p>


<h3 id="faith-traits">Faith Traits</h3>
<p>These traits rely upon conviction of spirit, perception, and religion, but are not directly tied to the worship of a specific deity. You do not need a patron deity to gain a faith trait, as these traits can represent conviction in yourself or your philosophy just as easily as they can represent dedication to a deity.</p>
<p><b>Beacon of Faith</b>: You wield the might of your faith with power and clarity. Once per day as a free action, you may treat your caster level as if it were 2 levels higher when using one of the granted powers of your domain or inquisition, or when casting one of your domain spells.</p>
<p><b>Birthmark</b>: You were born with a strange birthmark that looks very similar to the holy symbol of the god you chose to worship later in life. This birthmark can serve you as a divine focus for casting spells, and as a physical manifestation of your faith, and it increases your devotion to your god. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.</p>
<p><b>Blessed</b>: Some divine agent watches over you and heeds your call. Once per day as a swift action, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws for 1 round.</p>
<p><b>Caretaker</b>: As the child of an herbalist or an assistant in a temple infirmary, you often had to assist in tending to the sick and wounded. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/heal.html#_heal" >Heal</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/heal.html#_heal" >Heal</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Child of the Temple</b>: You have long served at a temple in a city, where you picked up on many of the nobility's customs in addition to spending much time in the temple libraries studying your faith. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nobility) and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Devotee of the Green</b>: Your faith in the natural world or one of the gods of nature makes it easy for you to pick up on related concepts. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography) and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nature) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Disdainful Defender</b>: You are resistant to the magic of other faiths. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all Will saves you attempt against divine spells. This bonus does not apply against divine spells cast by a caster who worships the same deity you do.</p>
<p><b>Ease of Faith</b>: Your mentor, the person who invested your faith in you from an early age, took steps to ensure you understood that what powers your divine magic is no different from that which powers the magic of other religions. This philosophy makes it easier for you to interact with others who may not share your views. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Fate's Favored</b>: The fates watch over you. Whenever you are under the effect of a luck bonus of any kind, that bonus increases by 1.</p>
<p><b>Fearless Defiance</b>: Upon overcoming your fear, you become a scourge to your enemies. You gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects. In addition, if you successfully save against such an effect, you receive a +1 trait bonus on attack rolls against your favored enemies for 1 round.</p>
<p><b>Focused Disciple</b>: When weaker wills falter, you keep a clear mind. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion effects.</p>
<p><b>History of Heresy</b>: You were raised with heretical views that have made it difficult for you to accept most religious beliefs and often caused you or those you love to be treated as pariahs. As a result, you have turned your back on religious teachings. As long as you do not possess any levels in a class that grants divine spellcasting power, you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against divine spells.</p>
<p><b>Indomitable Faith</b>: You were born in a region where your faith was not popular, but you still have never abandoned it. Your constant struggle to maintain your own faith has bolstered your drive. You gain a +1 trait bonus on Will saves.</p>
<p><b>Inspired</b>: A positive force, philosophy, or divine presence fills you with hope, and is a guiding force of inspiration. Once per day as a free action, roll twice and take the better result on a skill check or ability check.</p>
<p><b>Loyalty across Lifetimes</b>: You and your eidolon share a link that seems to span multiple lifetimes. Your eidolon treats its Constitution score as if it were 2 points higher for the purposes of determining when its negative hit point total sends it back to its home plane. In addition, your eidolon gains a +1 trait bonus on Will saves against enchantment spells and effects.</p>
<p><b>Martial Manuscript</b>: You either carry or have memorized a sacred text from your school, temple, or monastery, and its wisdom gives you insight that makes your attacks more devastating. You gain a +2 trait bonus on rolls to confirm critical hits when you're using an unarmed strike or monk weapon.</p>
<p><b>Oathbound</b>: You have made a solemn oath, and you pursue that oath with headstrong determination. Once per day, you may reroll a saving throw against a charm or compulsion effect. You must take the second result even if it is worse.</p>
<p><b>Omen</b>: You are the harbinger of some future event. Whether this event bodes good or ill, you exude an ominous presence. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate" >Intimidate</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate" >Intimidate</a> is always a class skill for you. Once per day, you may attempt to demoralize an opponent as a swift action.<b></b></p>
<p><b>Perpetual Companion</b>: You are bolstered against fear when your eidolon is near. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all saving throws against fear effects whenever your eidolon is within 30 feet.</p>
<p><b>Planar Savant</b>: You have always had an innate sense of the workings of the planes and their denizens. You may use your Charisma modifier when making <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) checks instead of your Intelligence modifier.</p>
<p><b>Principled</b>: You hold yourself to a strict code of behavior that guides all of your decisions and actions. You take a &mdash;2 penalty on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/bluff.html#_bluff" >Bluff</a> checks and gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against charm, compulsion, and emotion effects.</p>
<p><b>Prophesied</b>: Your coming was foretold in prophecy, and people familiar with your legend regard you with awe and fear. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> checks and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/intimidate.html#_intimidate" >Intimidate</a> checks when interacting with anyone familiar with you or your reputation.</p>
<p><b>Reincarnated</b>: You lived a previous life as someone&mdash;or something&mdash;else. For you, life and death are a cycle, and you have no fear of death. You gain a +2 trait bonus on saving throws against fear and death effects.</p>
<p><b>Sacred Conduit</b>: Your birth was particularly painful and difficult for your mother, who needed potent divine magic to ensure that you survived (your mother may or may not have survived). In any event, that magic infused you from an early age, and you now channel divine energy with greater ease than most. Whenever you channel energy, you gain a +1 trait bonus to the save DC of your channeled energy.</p>
<p><b>Sacred Touch</b>: You were exposed to a potent source of positive energy as a child, perhaps by being born under the right cosmic sign, or maybe because one of your parents was a gifted healer. As a standard action, you may automatically stabilize a dying creature merely by touching it.</p>
<p><b>Scholar of the Great Beyond</b>: Your greatest interests as a child did not lie with current events or the mundane&mdash;you have always felt out of place, as if you were born in the wrong era. You take to philosophical discussions of the Great Beyond and of historical events with ease. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (history) and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) checks, and one of these skills (your choice) is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Schooled Inquisitor</b>: Your additional training aids in identifying the wiles of your faith's enemies. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (planes) and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) checks made to identify the abilities and weaknesses of creatures.</p>
<p><b>Spirit Sense</b>: You are so attuned to the spiritual world that it is hard to get the jump on you. You gain a +2 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a> checks to avoid being surprised and to detect invisible or incorporeal creatures.</p>
<p><b>Tireless Avenger</b>: You restlessly pursue your enemies. When you're in pursuit of one of your favored enemies, the DC for the Constitution check to avoid taking lethal damage during a forced march is 10 + 1 per extra hour, instead of 10 + 2 per extra hour.</p>
<p><b>Wanderer's Shroud</b>: Your wanderings often go unnoticed. Efforts to use the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/diplomacy.html#_diplomacy" >Diplomacy</a> skill to gather information about you take a &mdash;1 penalty, and you gain a +1 trait bonus on all saving throws against scrying and mind-reading effects that allow saving throws.</p>
<p><b>Zealous Striker</b>: Your zeal is a danger to those of "lesser" faiths. While you have the destruction judgment active, you gain a +1 trait bonus on damage rolls when attacking a foe who can cast divine spells and worships a different deity than you.</p>


<h3 id="magic-traits">Magic Traits</h3>
<p>These traits are associated with magic and focus on spellcasting and manipulating magic. You don't have to be a spellcaster to take a magic trait (although several of these traits aren't useful to non-spellcasters). Magic traits can represent a character's early exposure to magical effects or childhood studies of magic.</p>
<p><b>Air-Touched</b>: You share an affinity with elemental air. You gain DR 1/&mdash; against creatures and attacks with the air type.</p>
<p><b>Alchemical Adept:</b> You are skilled in creating alchemical items. You gain a +2 trait bonus on all <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) checks made to craft alchemical items. Furthermore, when you fail a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) check by 5 or more but don't roll a natural 1, you don't ruin any raw materials or have to pay that cost again.</p>
<p><b>Alchemical Intuition</b>: You are often struck with epiphanies about alchemical processes and substances. Once per day as a free action, you may gain a trait bonus equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum 0) on a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy) check you make. You can apply this bonus after you roll the check, possibly turning a failure into a success.</p>
<p><b>Arcane Revitalization</b>: Your martial prowess can feed your arcane power. Once per day, when you confirm a critical hit with a weapon attack, you regain 1 arcane pool point. You can't exceed your maximum number of arcane pool points.</p>
<p><b>Arcane Temper</b>: You have quick reactions and fierce concentration. You gain a +1 trait bonus on concentration and initiative checks.</p>
<p><b>Ascendant Recollection</b>: Your first bloodline power is particularly strong. Your sorcerer level is considered to be 1 level higher when determining the effects of your 1st-level bloodline power.</p>
<p><b>Bladed Magic</b>: You have an innate talent for using magical weaponry and those weapons capable of becoming magical. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> checks made to craft magic or masterwork weapons. In addition, when you use your arcane pool class ability to grant a weapon an enhancement bonus, that bonus lasts for 2 minutes instead of 1.</p>
<p><b>Classically Schooled</b>: Your apprenticeship or early education was particularly focused on the direct application of magic. You gain a +1 trait bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/spellcraft.html#_spellcraft" >Spellcraft</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Cross-Disciplined</b>: Your dabbling has granted you greater insight into the proper casting of certain spells. Once per day, you may cast a spell you have prepared that appears on both the magus and wizard spell lists as if your caster level were 1 level higher.</p>
<p><b>Cross-Knowledge</b>: Once per day, you may treat an extract you drink as if your caster level were 1 level higher as long as that extract appears on the wizard spell list and the alchemist list of formulae.</p>
<p><b>Dangerously Curious</b>: You have always been intrigued by magic, possibly because you were the child of a magician or priest. You often snuck into your parent's laboratory or shrine to tinker with spell components and magic devices, and frequently caused quite a bit of damage and headaches for your parent as a result. You gain a +1 bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/useMagicDevice.html#_use-magic-device" >Use Magic Device</a> checks, and <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/useMagicDevice.html#_use-magic-device" >Use Magic Device</a> is always a class skill for you.</p>
<p><b>Desperate Resolve:</b> You are adept at casting spells even in the most precarious situations. You gain a +1 trait bonus on concentration checks. This trait bonus increases to +4 when you are grappled, pinned, in violent weather, or entangled.<b></b></p>
