<h1 id="background-generator">Background Generator</h1>
<p>The background generator is intended to remove the creative pressure that can sometimes frustrate players as they try to flesh out the murky details of their characters' backgrounds. This generator provides these details with either a simple roll of the die or the players deliberately selecting from options on the furnished tables and lists. Think of each element on the background generator's tables as a piece of story material that you can link together with other random pieces to create a story you otherwise might now have imagined. Use this tool to inspire creativity rather than as hard-and-fast rules to mandate rigid and seamless character backgrounds. Though the generator provides many foundational details of a character's background, it takes some creative thought to massage the specifics together. As you use the generator, feel free at any point to reject or reroll contradictory elements or ones that go against your vision of the emerging character. Like the background questions presented earlier in this chapter, the ideas on these tables are simply suggestions designed to channel and focus your imagination.</p>
<p>To generate a background, you roll on a number of tables and subtables, but before you do this, you must decide the gender, race, and class of your PC. Such decisions will help to inform the tables you'll use. After you've determined these basic character elements, you can begin using the background generator to determine your character's unique background by following the three steps summarized below, which are detailed further in the pages that follow.</p>
<p><b>Step 1&mdash;Homeland, Family, and Childhood</b>: Determine the circumstances of your birth, your parents' profession, and a major childhood event. To determine the number of siblings you have, roll on the table appropriate for your race. For each sibling you have, roll d%; 01&mdash;50: the sibling is female, 51&mdash;100: the sibling is male. Then roll on the <a href="#table-relative-age-of-sibling">Relative Age of Sibling table</a> to determine the relative age of the sibling.</p>
<p><b>Step 2&mdash;Adolescence and Training</b>: Determine the circumstances and events that defined your adolescence and the training you received, as well as create an influential associate from this time in your life.</p>
<p><b>Step 3&mdash;Moral Conflict, Relationships, and Vulnerabilities</b>: Determine a major conflict in your past, the other party involved, and how you resolved the conflict. Also determine your romantic relationships, relationships with fellow adventurers, and personality drawbacks.</p>
<p>While rolling on the tables in these three steps, you are sometimes granted access to a trait, story feat, or drawback. Upon gaining access to one of these rules elements, write it down. At the end of background generation, you can choose up to two of the traits you've gained access to. If you gained access to at least one drawback, you can take one of those drawbacks to gain an additional trait you have access to (following the normal rules for trait selection). When you gain access to a story feat, it means you've met the prerequisite for the feat and can take it at any time, not just at character creation.</p>

<h3 id="homeland-family-and-childhood">Step 1&mdash;Homeland, Family, and Childhood</h3>
<p>The tables below determine the basics of your family and homeland. These establish the circumstances of your upbringing, the composition of your family, and your family's social standing, as well as a major event you experienced in childhood. To determine these aspects of your background, do the following:</p>
<p>1. Find the sections for your race and roll on the Homeland, Parents, and Siblings tables within the section. If you have siblings, also consult <a href="#table-relative-age-of-sibling">Relative Age of Sibling table</a> and the <a href="table-race-of-adopted-sibling">Race of Adopted Sibling table</a> to determine the relative age of your siblings and the race of adopted siblings.</p>
<p>2. Roll on the <a href="#_circumstance-of-birth">Circumstance of Birth table</a>, to determine the circumstance of your birth. Based on those circumstances, you may have to roll on the subsequent tables to determine details of those circumstances.</p>
<p>3. Roll on the <a href="#_major-childhood-event">Major Childhood Event table</a> to determine a major childhood event.</p>
<p>4. Proceed to <a href="#_adolescence-and-training">Step 2&mdash;Adolescence and Training</a>.</p>

<tr class="odd"><td>01&mdash;10</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Any Fool Can Swing a Sword</b>: Sometime during your youth, you came to the conclusion that most melee and ranged weapons are crude and primitive compared to firearms.

<tr class="even"><td>11&mdash;20</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Bucking Tradition</b>: You come from a proud tradition of ancient arms and august codes of conduct like those followed by paladins, cavaliers, and samurai. Instead of following in the vaunted steps of your predecessors, though, you chose to learn the art of firearms to the shock and perhaps even anger of your family and peers. Your break with tradition fostered in you a nearly insurmountable will that fuels your identity as a gunslinger. You gain access to the Resolve of the Rejected combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>21&mdash;30</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Custodian of the Future</b>: Firearms are not just an effective implement for killing or a curious mechanical trinket; they are the next step in the technological development of your people.

This ongoing dedication improves your ability to repair firearms and make them deadlier while in your skilled hands. You gain access to the Unblemished Barrel combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>31&mdash;40</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Defining Moment</b>: Guns are inexorably linked to a moment where your life dramatically changed. Perhaps you were so sickly as a child that you couldn't turn a crossbow's winch or bend a bow, but firearms showed you that you could still hunt and fight. Perhaps you picked up a firearm in a desperate moment to help a wounded gunslinger and knew that you had just taken your first step along the same path. A firearm at your side instills in you a sense of purpose and destiny that no one can take away. You gain access to the Black Powder Fortune combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>41&mdash;50</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Look at What I Can Do</b>: The lure of something new and showy drove you to first pick up a gun.

You gain access to the Black Powder Bravado combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>51&mdash;60</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Mechanical Savant</b>: For you, the lure of firearms is not the effect they produce, but the science and mechanical process behind the effect.

<tr class="odd"><td>61&mdash;70</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Black Powder Presence</b>: You grew up belittled and even beaten for not being the biggest or the strongest of your compatriots, family, or race.

Your sense of higher purpose allows you to fight on and keep firing when winning seems impossible. You gain access to the Never Stop Shooting combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="odd"><td>81&mdash;90</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Shock and Awe</b>: The sound and fury of gunfire is as potent a weapon as the pellets and bullets your weapon discharges. You live for the reflexive wince that others make when they jump at the sound of a firearm, and laugh heartily at the amazement you inspire in others with your cacophonous black-powder weapons. You gain access to the Startling Report combat trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>91&mdash;100</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Some Things Are Stronger Than Magic</b>: You grew up either oppressed by magic cruelly wielded or loathing the elitism of those who possessed such arcane or divine power. Searching for something nonmagical that relies on skill and practice led you to the study and wielding of firearms. You relish trumping pompous spellcasters with a quick draw and a keen eye. You gain access to the Black Powder Interjection combat trait.</td></tr></table>

Perhaps you are a pilgrim for a good deity in an unholy land, or the secret enforcer of a sect that operates in the shadows of the world. You are accustomed to working alone and with little guidance from the superiors of your church, trusting your own moral judgment to act on behalf of your god. This certainty acts as a defense against the magic of other, "lesser" deities. You gain access to the Disdainful Defender faith trait.</td></tr>

<tr class="even"><td>11&mdash;20</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Conflicting Legacy</b>: You were born to a family or clan with two great pedigrees: one of magic and one of battle.

<p>Rangers are the hunters of legend.

<h2 id="summoner">Summoner</h2>
<p>Most, if not all, spellcasters can call to otherworldly creatures for aid. And though many learn to call increasingly powerful minions to assist them, none boast the same connection to these outsiders as summoners do. A summoner is defined by the bond formed with the single creature that acts as his eidolon. Protectors, steeds, and links to other worlds, eidolons are lifelong companions for their mortal masters. The choice to tie oneself to an eidolon and the circumstances leading to that choice form the foundation of any summoner's character.

<tr class="even"><td>11&mdash;20</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Caretaker</b>: You met your eidolon or another outsider in a moment of danger.

<tr class="odd"><td>21&mdash;30</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Forced to Confront Your Own Limits</b>: The bond with your eidolon first manifested when you saw someone in danger and were unable to help.

This need to exceed your own limitations continues to manifest in the evolution of your eidolon. You gain access to the Desperate Speed magic trait.</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>31&mdash;40</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Imaginary Friends</b>: As a child, you created imaginary playmates that you felt truly spoke to and heard you.

You gain access to the Perpetual Companion faith trait.</td></tr>

<tr class="odd"><td>61&mdash;70</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>Pick On Someone Your Own Size</b>: When you were young, you or others you cared for were bullied by agents of an oppressive power. At some point, you stood up against one or many of the tyrants, feeling that somehow you were bigger, stronger and more resilient than you actually were.

You gain access to the Loyalty across Lifetimes faith trait.</td></tr>

<tr class="odd"><td>41&mdash;45</td><td style="white-space: normal;"><b>The Relative</b>: There is a relative you were especially close to. To you, this person was the meaning of family.

<h2 id="moral-conflicts-relationships-and-drawbacks-">Step 3&mdash;Moral Conflicts, Relationships, and Drawbacks </h2>
<p>With age come the events and relationships that leave a definitive mark on your personality. You face and resolve moral challenges, your romantic relationships blossom and sometimes wilt, you meet those who become adventuring companions, and you face your vulnerabilities either in the form of personal challenges or adversaries who represent some side of yourself.</p>
<p>To determine a major conflict you had in the past, as well as your romantic relationships and personality drawbacks, do the following:</p>
<p>1. Roll on the tables below to determine a major conflict you had, whom you had the conflict with, the motivation for the conflict, and how you resolved it. Then adjust your alignment using the alignment track.</p>
<p>2. Choose the deity or religious philosophy you follow, which grants access to a trait.</p>
<p>3. Roll on the <a href="#_table-romantic-relationships">Romantic Relationships table</a> to determine what your romantic relationships have been like.</p>
<p>4. Roll on the <a href="#_table-relationship-with-fellow-adventurer">Relationship with a Fellow Adventurer table</a>, likely multiple times, to determine the various relationships with your fellow adventurers.</p>
<p>5. Roll on the <a href="#_table-character-drawback">Character Drawback table</a> to determine your character's drawbacks. You can take this drawback to gain another trait.</p>

<h3 id="major-conflict-and-alignment">Major Conflict and Alignment</h3>
<p>The following tables provide a means of determining your alignment by introducing a pivotal moral conflict in your early life&mdash;one moment during your ethical development that determined the kind of person you grew up to be.</p>
<p>When determining your conflict, you accumulate a number of Conflict Points (CP). The conflict and your motivation are each worth a number of CP; you can adjust the number of CP based on the resolution of the conflict. When you determine the total CP, you then must add your CP on one alignment track or distribute the points on both of them&mdash;the good-evil track and the lawful-chaotic track, as detailed on the <a href=#_table-determining-alignment-table">Determining Alignment table</a>. Position 1 on the track represents the first CP added. Each point on the first track represents you turning away from what is good and heading down a path of evil. Each point on the second track represents a disregard for law as you grow more chaotic. This determines how the conflict ultimately affected your alignment and to what extent. If you are using the rules for changing your alignment, this also determines your starting place on the alignment track. If you start with 0 CP on either track, assume you start at 1 on the track for those rules.</p>

<h3 id="conflicts">Conflicts</h3>
<p>Begin by rolling on the <a href="#_table-conflicts">Conflicts table</a>. This table lists 20 conflicts, ranging from minor indiscretions to grievous sins. The type of die you roll on this table is based on the needs of the campaign as well as your character's starting class. First, consult with your GM; If you can play any alignment in the campaign, roll a d20. If your campaign allows only nonevil characters, roll a d12. If you are playing a paladin or some other character who must be good, roll a d6. Once you are done, proceed to <a href="#_table-conflict-subject">Conflict Subject table</a> and to the tables and sections subsequent to it.</p>

<h3 id="resolution">Resolution</h3>
<p>Once you determine the nature and CP for the event, the next step is to determine the resolution. Instead of rolling for the conflict's resolution, you choose how you dealt with it, and your choice can affect the number of CP the conflict is worth. In games that do not allow evil characters, you cannot take a resolution that would adjust your character to an evil alignment.</p>
<p><b>Regret and Penance (&mdash;3 CP)</b>: Not only do you regret your action, but you have publicly admitted to it and did your best to make amends for the wrongdoing. Most know of the conflict's details and those who don't can easily find them out if they know where to look or whom to ask.</p>
<p><b>Sincere Regret (&mdash;2 CP)</b>: Though you feel sincere regret for the event and its memory affects your behavior, it's still a secret. Only your trusted companions know of the conflict, and they have promised a degree of discretion.</p>
<p><b>Secret Regret (&mdash;1 CP)</b>: You regret the conflict, but go to great lengths to keep it secret and try desperately to forget it ever happened. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement in the conflict.</p>
<p><b>Mixed Feelings (0 CP)</b>: Sometimes you regret the conflict, but other times you feel as if you didn't have a choice in the matter or that you made the right decision. Most of the time, you just avoid thinking about the conflict. Only you and maybe a select few people know of your involvement.</p>
<p><b>Denial (+1 CP)</b>: You feel little if any regret, and deny the event mostly so others won't judge you. Few if any know of your part in the conflict, and your constant denials are meant to keep it that way.</p>
<p><b>No Guilt (+2 CP)</b>: Either guilt is for the weak, or you know you made the right decision. You might not openly brag about your part in the conflict, but you don't deny it when confronted either.</p>
<p><b>You Enjoyed It (+3 CP)</b>: Those who cling to petty morals have no understanding of what true freedom and power is. The fact is, you enjoyed your part in the conflict and would do it all over again if the opportunity presented itself. Many people know of your misdeed, and they also realize your complete lack of remorse.</p>

<h2 id="crime-and-punishment">Crime and Punishment</h2>
<p>If you have the Criminal social trait, roll on Table 1&mdash;30 to determine the crime for which you were accused or convicted. After determining the crime, roll on Table 1&mdash;31 to learn the severity of the punishment you received&mdash;or have yet to receive&mdash;for having been judged guilty.</p>

<h3 id="deity-and-religious-philosophy">Deity and Religious Philosophy</h3>
<p>Once you have determined your alignment, choose a deity or religious philosophy. Association with a specific deity gives you access to a related religion trait. Even if you are not interested in your character being associated with a deity, you can choose "No Deity" or "Undecided" granting you access to abilities outside the realm of faith.</p>

You gain access to the Tireless Logic social trait.</p>
<p><b>Undecided</b>: You have remained undecided when it comes to your faith, but are accepting of others' faiths and are at least somewhat open to the idea of joining an organized faith should you find one that strikes your fancy. You gain access to the Ease of Faith faith trait.</p>


<h3 id="romantic-relationships">Romantic Relationships</h3>
<p>Roll on the table below to determine the kinds of romantic relationships you have had in the past. You might have a background that requires you to roll a d12 on this table instead of a d20.</p>

</div>


<h3 id="relationship-with-fellow-adventurers">Relationship with Fellow Adventurers</h3>
<p>This table is best used by the adventuring party as a whole to determine starting relationships between the characters. One player begins the process by choosing someone in the group and rolling to learn the relationship between her and the second character. Then the next player chooses a different character and rolls to determine their relationship, and so on, until finally the last player rolls to determine his relationship with the first character. It is easiest to do this sitting around a table, with each player passing the dice clockwise until the dice have completed a full turn around the table.</p>
<p>You can also use this table free-form if you wish, rolling for your relationship for as many or as few of the other characters as you care to define; however, the first method guarantees that every character has connections to two other characters to improve group cohesion.</p>
<p>If you end up with a result that makes no sense or isn't possible, reroll or just chose another option.</p>

<h3 id="character-drawback">Character Drawback</h3>
<p>Character drawbacks are emotional weak points&mdash;chinks your armor. A drawback gives you a small mechanical penalty and a roleplaying hook. Drawbacks also serve as loopholes in the alignment system. When roleplaying your drawback, you might act well outside the bounds of your alignment within certain situations. Each of the following grants a drawback you may choose to take. If you take a drawback option, you may take three traits you have access to instead of two. Roll on the following table to determine your character's drawback.</p>
<p>Discuss with the GM the details of this drawback, such as what the attachment is or who the person involved might be.</p>
