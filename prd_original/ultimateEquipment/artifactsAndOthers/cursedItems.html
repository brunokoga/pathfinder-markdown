<h1 id="cursed-items">Cursed Items</h1>
<p>Cursed items are any magic items with some sort of potentially negative impact on the user. Occasionally, they mix bad with good, forcing characters to make difficult choices. Cursed items are almost never made intentionally. Instead, they are the result of rushed work, inexperienced crafters, or a lack of proper components. While many of these items still function, they either do not work as intended or come with serious drawbacks. When a magic item creation skill check fails by 5 or more, roll on <a href="#_cursed-item-drawbacks-table">Cursed Items Drawbacks table</a> to determine the type of curse possessed by the item.</p>
<p><b>Identifying Cursed Items</b>: Cursed items are identified like any other magic item, with one exception: unless the check made to identify the item exceeds the DC by 10 or more, the curse is not detected. If the check is not made by 10 or more, but still succeeds, all that is revealed is the item crafter's original intent. If the item is known to be cursed, the nature of the curse can be determined using the standard DC to identify the item.</p>
<p><b>Removing Cursed Items</b>: While some cursed items can simply be discarded, others force a compulsion upon the user to keep the item, no matter the costs. Others reappear even if discarded or are impossible to throw away. These items can only be discarded after the character or item is targeted by a <i>remove curse</i> spell or similar magic. the dc of the caster level check to undo the curse is equal to 10 + the cursed item's caster level. if the spell is successful, the item can be discarded on the following round, but the curse reasserts itself if the item is used again.</p>

<h2 id="common-cursed-item-effects">Common Cursed Item Effects</h2>
<p>The following are some of the most common cursed item effects. GMs should feel free to invent new cursed item effects to fit specific items. </p>
<p><b>Delusion</b>: The user believes the item is what it appears to be, yet it actually has no magical power other than to deceive. The user is mentally fooled into thinking the item is functioning and cannot be convinced otherwise without the casting of <i>remove curse</i>.</p>
<p><b>Opposite Effect or Target</b>: These cursed items malfunction so that they either do the opposite of what the creator intended or target the user instead of someone else. The interesting point to keep in mind here is that these items aren't always bad to have&mdash;some have powerful applications once the effect is fully understood. Opposite-effect items include weapons that impose penalties on attack and damage rolls rather than bonuses. Just as a character shouldn't necessarily immediately know what the enhancement bonus of a noncursed magic item is, she shouldn't immediately know that a weapon is cursed. Once she knows, however, the item can be discarded unless it possesses some ability that compels the wielder to keep and use it. In such cases, a <i>remove curse</i> spell is generally needed to get rid of the item.</p>
<p><b>Intermittent Functioning</b>: The three varieties of intermittent functioning items all function perfectly as intended&mdash;at least some of the time. The three varieties are unreliable, dependent, and uncontrolled items.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Unreliable</i>: Each time the item is activated, there is a 5% chance (01&ndash;05 on d%) that it does not function.</p>
<p><i>Dependent</i>: The item only functions in certain situations. To determine the situation, select or roll on the following table.</p>
</blockquote>

<tr class="odd"><td>97&ndash;99</td><td>On holy days or during particular astrological events</td></tr>
<tr class="even"><td>100</td><td>More than 100 miles from a particular site</td></tr></table>
<blockquote>
<p><i>Uncontrolled</i>: An uncontrolled item occasionally activates at random times. Roll d% every day. On a result of 01&ndash;05, the item activates at some random point during that day. </p>
</blockquote>
<p><b>Requirement</b>: Some items have stringent requirements that must be met for them to be usable. To keep an item with this kind of curse functioning, one or more of the following conditions must be met.</p>
<ul><li>Character must eat twice as much as normal.</li>
<li>Character must sleep twice as much as normal.</li>
<li>Character must undergo a specific quest (one time only, and the item functions normally thereafter).</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 100 gp in valuables per day.</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice (destroy) 2,000 gp worth of magic items each week.</li>
<li>Character must discard all other magic items.</li>
<li>Character must worship a particular deity.</li>
<li>Character must change her name to a specific name. The item only works for characters of that name.</li>
<li>Character must take a level in a specific class at the next opportunity if not of that class already.</li>
<li>Character must have a minimum number of ranks in a particular skill.</li>
<li>Character must sacrifice some part of her life energy (2 points of Constitution) one time. If the character gets the Constitution points back (such as from a <i>restoration </i>spell), the item ceases functioning. (the item does not cease functioning if the character receives a constitution increase caused by level gain, a <i>wish, </i>or the use of a magic item.)</li>
<li>Item must be cleansed with holy water each day.</li>
<li>Item must be used to kill a living creature each day.</li>
<li>Item must be bathed in volcanic lava once per month.</li>
<li>Item must be used at least once a day, or it won't function again for its current possessor.</li>
<li>Item must have a particular spell cast upon it each day (such as <i>bless</i>, <i>atonement</i>, or <i>animate objects</i>).</li></ul>
<p>Requirements are so dependent upon suitability to the individual item that they should never be determined randomly. An intelligent item with a requirement often imposes its requirement through its personality. If the requirement is not met, the item ceases to function. If it is met, usually the item functions for one day before the requirement must be met again (although some requirements are one time only, others monthly, and still others continuous).</p>
<p><b>Drawback</b>: Items with drawbacks are usually still beneficial to the possessor, but carry some negative aspect. Although sometimes drawbacks occur only when the item is used (or held, in the case of some weapons), usually the drawback remains with the character for as long as she has the item.</p>
<p>Unless otherwise indicated, drawbacks remain in effect as long as the item is possessed. The DC to save against any of these effects is usually equal to 10 + the item's caster level.</p>

<h2 id="specific-cursed-items">Specific Cursed Items</h2>
<p>Perhaps the most dangerous and insidious of all cursed items are those whose intended functions are completely replaced by a curse. Yet even these items can have their uses, particularly as traps or weapons. The following are provided as specific examples of cursed items. Instead of prerequisites for construction, each cursed item is associated with one or more ordinary magic items whose creation might result in the cursed item. Cursed items can be sold, as if they were the item they appear to be, provided the curse is not known to the buyer.</p>
<p>Cursed suits of armor and weapons can come in many forms, and the examples listed here are merely the most common. For example, a<i> &ndash;2 cursed sword</i>, might appear as a <i>+3 shortsword </i>or a <i>+1 dagger</i>, with a similar penalty instead of the listed &ndash;2.</p>

<p id="-2-Cursed-Sword" class="stat-block-title">-2 Cursed Sword</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>Aura</b> strong evocation; <b>CL </b>15th; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This longsword performs well against targets in practice, but when used in combat its wielder takes a &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls.</p>
<p class="stat-block">All damage dealt is also reduced by 2 points, but never below a minimum of 1 point of damage on any successful hit. The sword always forces that character to employ it rather than another weapon. The sword's owner automatically draws it and fights with it even when she meant to draw or ready some other weapon.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> neck; <b>Aura</b> moderate abjuration; <b>CL </b>10th; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This device appears to prevent location, scrying and detection, or influence by <i>detect thoughts</i> or telepathy, as per an <i>amulet of proof against detection and location</i>. Actually, the amulet gives the wearer a &ndash;10 penalty on all saves against divination spells.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> Armor; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration; <b>CL </b>16th; <b>Weight</b> 50 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Magical analysis indicates that this armor is a normal suit of <i>+3 full plate. </i>The armor works normally with regard to melee attacks but actually attracts ranged weapons. The wearer takes a &ndash;15 penalty to <span class="hyperlink-1">AC</i> against ranged weapons. The true nature of the armor does not reveal itself until the character is fired upon in earnest. </p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Intended Magic Item</b></p>

<p class="stat-block">This armor is similar in appearance to <i>armor of <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/command.html#_command" >command</a> </i>and functions as a suit of <i>+1 full plate</i>. However, when it is worn, the armor causes the character to take a &ndash;4 penalty to <span class="hyperlink-1">Charisma</i>. All unfriendly creatures within 300 feet gain a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against her. The effect is not noticeable to the wearer or those affected. In other words, the wearer does not immediately notice that donning the armor is the cause of her problems, nor do foes understand the reason for the depth of their enmity.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This shortbow is beautifully made and inlaid with iridescent designs, appearing to be a <i>+2 shortbow</i>. When it fires its arrows, though, it does it with so much force that the arrows are always broken on either a hit or a miss. This bow must be used as its owner's primary ranged weapon and can only be discarded after the owner is subject to a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/removeCurse.html#_remove-curse" >remove curse</a></i> spell or similar effect.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration; <b>CL </b>17th; <b>Weight</b> 15 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This bag appears to be an ordinary sack. Detection for magical properties makes it seem as if it were a <i>bag of holding</i>. The sack, however, is something entirely different and more insidious&mdash;one of the feeding orifices of an extradimensional creature.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Any substance of animal or vegetable nature is subject to “swallowing'' if thrust within the bag. The <i>bag of devouring </i>is 90% likely to ignore any initial intrusion, but anytime thereafter that it senses living flesh within (such as if someone reaches into the bag to pull something out), it is 60% likely to close around the offending appendage and attempt to draw the whole victim in. The bag has a +8 bonus on combat maneuver checks made to grapple. If it pins a creature, it pulls the victim inside as a free action. The bag has a <span class="hyperlink-1">CMD</i> of 18 for those attempting to break free.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The bag can hold up to 30 cubic feet of matter. It acts as a <i>bag of holding  type I</i>, but each hour it has a 5% cumulative chance of swallowing the contents and then spitting the stuff out in some nonspace or on some other plane. Creatures drawn within are consumed in 1 round. The bag destroys the victim's body and prevents any form of raising or <span class="hyperlink-1">resurrection</i> that requires part of the corpse. There is a 50% chance that a <i>wish</i>, <i>miracle</i>, or <i>true  resurrection</i> spell can restore a devoured victim to life. Check once for each destroyed creature. If the check fails, the creature cannot be brought back to life by mortal magic. </p>

A <i>belt of weakness </i>confers a &ndash;4 penalty to its wearer's Constitution score. Furthermore, when the wearer rolls a natural 1 on any Fortitude save, the belt constricts, dealing 2d8 points of damage. </p>

<p class="stat-block">This sword appears to be a <i>+2 greatsword. </i>However, whenever it is used in battle, its wielder goes berserk (gaining all the benefits and drawbacks of the barbarian's rage ability). He attacks the nearest creature and continues to fight until <span class="hyperlink-1">unconscious</i> or dead or until no living thing remains within 30 feet.

However, after wearing it for 7 days, its owner instead comes to suffer from almost constant hunger and thirst, which, if not sated, ultimately drives him mad enough to become a cannibal. The wearer must eat and drink a full day's worth of food and water each hour to avoid making a starvation or thirst check.

The affected creatures react negatively to effects that harm “their” type of undead, so “vampires” avoid garlic, “wraiths” recoil from sunlight, and so on. The creatures continue to believe they are actually undead and ignore all evidence to the contrary. If attacked, they defend themselves, even if this requires using abilities they have but “their” type of undead normally lacks; for example, a barbarian who thinks she's a ghoul can still rage.

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>Aura</b> faint divination; <b>CL </b>5th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This small, 6-inch-square glass tablet grows to a 6-foot-by-3-foot window if placed on any sufficiently large vertical surface and returns to its original size if removed. The window melds ever so slightly into the surface, allowing it to ignore minor protrusions, curves, or anything else that would normally make it difficult to simply lay down a pane of glass.</p>
<p class="stat-block">On command, the front of this glass displays all activities on the other side of this surface like a window, piercing wood, earth, or stone up to 10 feet deep, but not metal. The window does not reveal its existence to non-hostile creatures depicted within it, allowing observers to study them at their leisure.</p>
<p class="stat-block">However, once the owner of the window uses it to spy on hostile creatures, its curse activates. From that moment on, the window presents its owner and anyone looking through the window with an artificial image of the other side designed to lull them into a sense of false confidence&mdash;enemies appear sleeping or drunk, pits have obvious plank bridges for easy crossing, and so on. While presenting this image to those in front of the mirror, it reveals those viewers to the enemies being observed, creating a two-way window; however, viewed creatures see those using the mirror accurately and can read their thoughts as if using <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/detectThoughts.html#_detect-thoughts" >detect thoughts</a></i>. Furthermore, the image shown to those using the mirror does not reveal that the creatures they are watching can see them as well.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once the curse activates, the owner comes to regard using the mirror to spy ahead as his most effective tactic (after all, it has no limit to its duration) and does so whenever possible until curse-breaking magic frees him from its influence. Anyone who uses the mirror to spy on hostiles, even if he wasn't the one to activate the mirror, is also subject to this desire to continue using it.</p>

If the wielder or ally is attempting to affect multiple creatures, the gun shoots a random member of the group.

<p class="stat-block">This shield behaves in all ways as an <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/armor.html#_absorbing-shield" >absorbing shield</a></i> until its owner attempts to use its disintegration power in combat. Once he does, it instead causes one or more monsters to pour forth from the shield and attack the nearest creature each round (including the shield-bearer) for 1d6 rounds before retreating by the safest possible route. If there is no such path for them to escape, the monsters fight to the death. To determine the nature and number of the monsters, roll 2d4 to determine the level of the <i>summon monster</i> spell and roll 1d3 to determine the number of creatures that appear. Monsters conjured by this shield remain until killed, act as normal for their kind, and are treated as summoned creatures with a permanent duration.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once its curse activates, the shield calls forth monsters three times per day, approximately every 8 hours. If the monsters cannot emerge directly from the shield and survive (for example, because it's buried or underwater), they instead appear at the nearest safe location within 50 feet. Successful curse-breaking magic cast on the shield restores it to its previous guise as an <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/armor.html#_absorbing-shield" >absorbing shield</a></i> and allows its wearer to abandon it.</p>

It usually functions as intended, but each time someone uses the staff, they must roll d%. On a roll of 1&ndash;10, instead of the desired effect, the staff acts like a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-wonder" >rod of wonder</a></i>. </p>

Once living matter&mdash;such as wood, paper, or a dead body&mdash;crumbles to dust and is destroyed. One flask contains enough unguent to affect eight Medium or smaller creatures or objects. A Large creature or object counts as two Medium creatures or objects and a Huge creature or object counts as four Medium creatures or objects.</p>
