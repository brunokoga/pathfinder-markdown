<h1 id="artifacts">Artifacts</h1>
<p>There exist throughout the world items that were never meant for the hands of mortals, powers that by all rights should solely be the province of divine beings and the elemental forces of creation. Yet occasionally, whether by accident, calamity, or strange fate, shards of such impossible might do fall into the hands of mortals. These motes of the unfathomable are called artifacts, and where they pass, lands shudder, nations rise, and legends are born.</p>
<p>Rather than merely another form of magical equipment, artifacts are the sorts of legendary relics that might become the focus of whole campaigns&mdash;sparking quests to recover them, fights against their wielders, missions to destroy them, and more. </p>
<p>Unlike normal magic items, artifacts are not easily destroyed (and are impossible for PCs to create). Instead of construction information, each artifact includes one possible means by which it might be destroyed.</p>
<p>Artifacts should never be purchased or found as part of a random treasure hoard. When placing an artifact in your game, be sure to consider its impact, but also keep in mind that artifacts are fickle objects, and if they become too much of a nuisance, they can easily become lost once more.</p>

<h2 id="minor-artifacts">Minor Artifacts</h2>
<p>Minor artifacts are not necessarily unique items. Even so, they are magic items that can no longer be created by common mortal means.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong (all schools); <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The <i>beacon of true faith</i> takes the form of an ornate torch made of electrum. It holds an undying magical flame that requires no fuel or air, and in the hands of most creatures it simply functions as an everburning torch. When held by a divine spellcaster, an outsider with an alignment subtype, or a creature of strong religious faith (GM's discretion, but usually requiring a feat or trait reflecting this devotion), the beacon gains additional powers based on the bearer's alignment. For example, a lawful good paladin gains access to the lawful and good powers, but a neutral cleric gains access to no powers. All of these are command-word activated.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Chaotic (violet flame): <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wordOfChaos.html#_word-of-chaos" >Word of chaos</a></i> once per day on command.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong (all schools); <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This tome bestows the ability to use the spells within its pages upon any bearer of any class. However, a bearer not already able to use spells gains one </span>negative level for as long as the book is in her possession or while she makes use of its powers. A book of infinite spells contains 1d8+22 pages. The nature of each page is determined by a d% roll: 01&ndash;50, arcane spell; 51&ndash;100, divine spell. </span>Determine the exact spell randomly.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once a page is turned, it can never be flipped back&mdash;paging through the book is a one-way trip. If the book is closed, it always opens again to the page it was on before the book was closed. When the last page is turned, the book vanishes.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once per day, the owner of the book can cast the spell to which the book is opened. If that spell happens to be one that is on the character's class spell list, she can cast it up to four times per day. The pages cannot be ripped out without destroying the book. Similarly, the spells cannot be cast as if from a scroll, nor can they be copied into a spellbook&mdash;their magic is bound permanently within the book itself.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The owner of the book need not have the book in her possession in order to use its power. The book can be stored elsewhere and still allow its owner to cast spells by means of its power, so long as no other creature attempts to make use of the book, in so doing becoming its owner.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Each time a spell is cast, there is a chance that the energy connected with its use causes the page to magically turn despite all precautions. The chance of a page turning depends on the spell the page contains and what sort of spellcaster the owner is.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong conjuration; <b>CL</b> 15th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This verdant branch glows with a soothing, pale green light. Carefully pruned from the world's first tree, this artifact hums with energy. Full of everlasting life, it needs time to transfer its magic. It can cast <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/heal.html#_heal" >heal</a></i> at will, but needs a full hour to do so. Once a day, it can cast <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/resurrection.html#_resurrection" >resurrection</a></i>, but it takes the full day to do so. </p>
<p class="stat-block">The branch serves only those who are worthy. It will not stay in the possession of a non-good creature for long, disappearing in 1d4 days. It will similarly disappear while in the possession of a good creature who associates with nongood creatures, but this takes 2d8 days to occur.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The <i>branch of life</i> can be destroyed by taking it to the heart of the Negative Energy Plane.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> Head; <b>Aura</b> strong enchantment; <b>CL</b> 18th; <b>Weight</b> 3 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The creation of some long-forgotten tyrant, this iron crown is fitted with four retractable spikes that can slide into the crown's interior. When the <i>crown of the iron king</i> is placed on a creature's head, these spikes burrow violently inward. The wearer becomes the thrall of the creature who placed the crown on it for as long as it wears the crown. The crown must be placed on either a willing or unconscious creature, which takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity. Taking off the crown also takes a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity and can be taken only by the creature who put the crown on the wearer, or at the command of that creature. Although the crown's spikes dig into the head of the wearer, it does no permanent harm aside from leaving four vicious-looking scars once the crown is removed. </p>
<p class="stat-block">Once a creature becomes a thrall of the crown's user, it must do everything the user commands, as per the spell <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dominatePerson.html#_dominate-person" >dominate person</a></i>&mdash;though the crown's dominance is not limited to humanoids, lasts as long the creature is wearing the crown, and allows no saving throw.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The crown is destroyed if a creature places the crown on its own head. This not only destroys the crown but it also kills the wearer. The wearer cannot be returned to life by any means short of divine intervention.</p>

<p id="deck-of-many-things" class="stat-block-title">Deck of Many Things</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong (all schools); <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class="stat-block">A <i>deck of many things </i>is usually found in a box or leather pouch. Each deck contains a number of cards or plaques made of ivory or vellum. Each is engraved with glyphs, characters, and sigils. As soon as one of these cards is drawn from the pack, its magic is bestowed upon the person who drew it, for better or worse.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The character with a <i>deck of many things </i>who wishes to draw a card must announce how many cards she will draw before she begins. Cards must be drawn within 1 hour of each other, and a character can never draw from this deck any more cards than she has announced. If the character does not willingly draw her allotted number (or if she is somehow prevented from doing so), the cards flip out of the deck on their own. If the Idiot or Jester is drawn, the possessor of the deck may elect to draw additional cards.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Each time a card is taken from the deck, it is replaced (making it possible to draw the same card twice) unless the draw is the Jester or the Fool, in which case the card is discarded from the pack. A <i>deck of many things </i>contains 22 cards. To simulate the magic cards, you may want to use tarot cards, as indicated in the second column of the accompanying table. If no tarot deck is available, substitute ordinary playing cards instead, as indicated in the third column. The effects of each card, summarized on the table, are clarified below.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Balance</i>: The character must change to a radically different alignment. If the character fails to act according to the new alignment, she gains a negative level.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Comet</i>: The character must single-handedly defeat the next hostile monster or monsters encountered, or the benefit is lost. If successful, the character gains enough XP to attain the next experience level.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Donjon</i>: This card signifies imprisonment&mdash;either by the <i>imprisonment</i> spell or by some powerful being. All gear and spells are stripped from the victim in any case. Draw no more cards.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Euryale</i>: The medusa-like visage of this card brings a curse that only the Fates card or a deity can remove. The &ndash;1 penalty on all saving throws is otherwise permanent.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>The Fates</i>: This card enables the character to avoid even an instantaneous occurrence if so desired, for the fabric of reality is unraveled and respun. Note that it does not enable something to happen. It can only stop something from happening or reverse a past occurrence. The reversal is only for the character who drew the card; other party members may have to endure the situation.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Flames</i>: Hot anger, jealousy, and envy are but a few of the possible motivational forces for the enmity. The enmity of the outsider can't be ended until one of the parties has been slain. Determine the outsider randomly, and assume that it attacks the character (or plagues her life in some way) within 1d20 days.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Fool</i>: The payment of XP and the redraw are mandatory. This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Jester.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Gem</i>: This card indicates wealth. The jewelry is all gold set with gems, each piece worth 2,000 gp, and the gems are worth 1,000 gp each. </p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Idiot</i>: This card causes the drain of 1d4+1 points of Intelligence immediately. The additional draw is optional.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Jester</i>: This card is always discarded when drawn, unlike all others except the Fool. The redraws are optional.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Key</i>: The magic weapon granted must be one usable by the character. It suddenly appears out of nowhere in the character's hand.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Knight</i>: The fighter appears out of nowhere and serves loyally until death. He or she is of the same race (or kind) and gender as the character. This fighter can be taken as a cohort by a character with the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_leadership" >Leadership</a> feat.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Moon</i>: This card bears the image of a moonstone gem with the appropriate number of <i>wishes </i>shown as gleams therein; sometimes it depicts a moon with its phase indicating the number of <i>wishes </i>(full = four; gibbous = three; half = two; quarter = one). These <i>wishes </i>are the same as those granted by the 9th-level wizard spell and must be used within a number of minutes equal to the number received.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Rogue</i>: When this card is drawn, one of the character's NPC friends (preferably a cohort) is totally alienated and made forever hostile. If the character has no cohorts, the enmity of some powerful personage (or community, or religious order) can be substituted. The hatred is secret until the time is ripe for it to be revealed with devastating effect.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Ruin</i>: As implied by its name, when this card is drawn, all nonmagical possessions of the drawer are lost.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Skull</i>: A dread wraith appears. The character must fight it alone&mdash;if others help, dread wraiths appear to fight them as well. If the character is slain, she is slain forever and cannot be revived, even with a <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i>.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Star</i>: The 2 points are added to any ability the character chooses. They cannot be divided among two abilities. </p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Sun</i>: Roll for a medium wondrous item until a useful item is indicated.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Talons</i>: When this card is drawn, every magic item owned or possessed by the character is instantly and irrevocably lost, except for the deck.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Throne</i>: The character becomes a true leader in people's eyes. The castle gained appears in any open area she wishes (but the decision where to place it must be made within 1 hour).</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Vizier</i>: This card empowers the character drawing it with the one-time ability to call upon a source of wisdom to solve any single problem or answer fully any question upon her request. The query or request must be made within 1 year. Whether the information gained can be successfully acted upon is another matter entirely.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>The Void</i>: This black card spells instant disaster. The character's body continues to function, as though comatose, but her psyche is trapped in a prison somewhere&mdash;in an object on a far plane or planet, possibly in the possession of an outsider. A <i>wish</i> or a <i>miracle</i> does not bring the character back, instead merely revealing the plane of entrapment. Draw no more cards. </p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">This item can be destroyed by losing it in a wager with a deity of law. The deity must be unaware of the nature of the deck.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong varies; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 15 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This <i>+3 Large <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-returning" >returning</a> warhammer</i> deals 2d6 points of damage on a successful hit. In the hands of a wielder who wears a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/wondrousItems.html#_belt-of-giant-strength" >belt of giant strength</a></i> and knows the weapon is a <i>hammer of thunderbolts</i> (not just the <i>+3 warhammer</i> it appears to be), it becomes a <i>+5 Large giant-bane <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-returning" >returning</a> <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_thundering" >thundering</a> warhammer</i> with the following two properties. One, when the bearer hits with the hammer as a thrown attack, it emits a powerful clap of thunder, causing all creatures within 90 feet to be stunned for 1 round (DC 15 Fortitude negates); the wielder is not immune to this effect. Two, the hammer's range increment increases to 30 feet.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">A <i>hammer of thunderbolts</i> is destroyed if heated in a fire giant's forge and quenched in the blood of a good-aligned humanoid, which causes the iron of the <i>hammer</i> to become so brittle it shatters the next time it is used to strike. Only bathing it in a fire giant's blood can reverse its brittleness. Once shattered, nothing can repair it.</p>

<p id="knucklebone-of-fickle-fortune" class="stat-block-title">Knucklebone of Fickle Fortune</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong (all schools); <b>CL </b>20th; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class="stat-block">At first sight, the artifact appears to be nothing more than a piece of bone worn down to a near sphere, but when a creature picks it up, the <i>knucklebone's</i> true power and nature becomes apparent. When a creature holding the <i>knucklebone of fickle fortune</i> looks upon it, he sees that the bone is actually a perfectly shaped die with 20 sides, each side bearing a glowing red symbol of power. When the creature rolls the die, instead of falling to the floor it rolls upward in mid-air, stopping at the eye level of the creature who rolled it. It then takes its effect, based on the side immediately facing its caster. Roll a 20-sided die to determine the effect (see the table). For effects that are lost if the die is rolled again (such as #17) or a specific result is rolled (such as #14), the character is aware of this restriction.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The <i>knucklebone of fickle fortune</i> disappears if its Eha-Zah face (a 20 on the die) comes up on 20 consecutive rolls. Some sages believe that this does not destroy the artifact, and it instead reappears at some random spot in the world. Such knowledge is purely conjecture, for it is not known whether anyone has accomplished this improbable task.</p>

This cavity is lined with a magical type of quicksilver that enables any character with at least 10 ranks in Craft (alchemy) to transmute base metals (iron and lead) into silver and gold. A single <i>philosopher's stone </i>can turn up to 5,000 pounds of iron into silver (worth 25,000 gp), or up to 1,000 pounds of lead into gold (worth 50,000 gp).

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> none; <b>Aura</b> strong transmutation; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class="stat-block">A <i>sphere of annihilation </i>is a globe of absolute blackness 2 feet in diameter. Any matter that comes in contact with a sphere is instantly sucked into the void and utterly destroyed. Only the direct intervention of a deity can restore an annihilated character.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A <i>sphere of annihilation</i> is static, resting in some spot as if it were a normal hole. It can be caused to move, however, by mental effort (think of this as a mundane form of <i>telekinesis</i>, too weak to move actual objects but a force to which the sphere, being weightless, is sensitive). A character's ability to gain control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i> (or to keep controlling one) is based on the result of a control check against DC 30 (a move action). A control check is 1d20 + character level + character Intelligence modifier. If the check succeeds, the character can move the sphere (perhaps to bring it into contact with an enemy) as a free action.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Control of a sphere can be established from as far away as 40 feet (the character need not approach too closely). Once control is established, it must be maintained by continuing to make control checks (all DC 30) each round. For as long as a character maintains control (does not fail a check) in subsequent rounds, he can control the sphere from a distance of 40 feet + 10 feet per character level. The sphere's speed in a round is 10 feet + 5 feet for every 5 points by which the character's control check result in that round exceeded 30.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If a control check fails, the sphere slides 10 feet in the direction of the character attempting to move it. If two or more creatures vie for control of a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, the rolls are opposed. If none are successful, the sphere slips toward the one who rolled lowest.</p>

If a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation" >rod of cancellation</a></i> touches a <i>sphere of annihilation</i>, they negate each other in a tremendous explosion.

<p class="stat-block">A long wooden staff, shod in iron and inscribed with sigils and runes of all types, this potent artifact contains many spell powers and other functions. Unlike a normal staff, a <i>staff of the magi</i> holds 50 charges and cannot be recharged normally. Some of its powers use charges, while others don't. A <i>staff of the magi</i> does not lose its powers if it runs out of charges. </p>

<p class="stat-block">A <i>staff of the magi</i> gives the wielder spell resistance 23. If this is willingly lowered, however, the staff can also be used to absorb arcane spell energy directed at its wielder, as a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-absorption" >rod of absorption</a></i> does. Unlike the rod, this staff converts spell levels into charges rather than retaining them as spell energy usable by a spellcaster. If the staff absorbs enough spell levels to exceed its limit of 50 charges, it explodes as if a retributive strike had been performed (see below). The wielder has no idea how many spell levels are cast at her, for the staff does not communicate this knowledge as a <i>rod of absorption</i> does. (Thus, absorbing spells can be risky.)</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">A <i>staff of the magi</i> can be broken for a retributive strike. Such an act must be purposeful and declared by the wielder. All charges in the staff are released in a 30-foot spread. All within 10 feet of the broken staff take hit points of damage equal to 8 times the number of charges in the staff, those between 11 feet and 20 feet away take points equal to 6 times the number of charges, and those 21 feet to 30 feet distant take 4 times the number of charges. A DC 23 Reflex save reduces damage by half. </p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The character breaking the staff has a 50% chance (01&ndash;50 on d%) of traveling to another plane of existence, but if she does not (51&ndash;100), the explosive release of spell energy destroys her (no saving throw). </p>

Its powers are quite different, however, and are dependent on the Charisma of the holder. Any character touching a <i>talisman of reluctant wishes</i> must make a DC 15 Charisma check. </p>
<p class="stat-block">If the check fails, the talisman acts as a <i>stone of weight</i>. Discarding it results in 5d6 points of damage to the character and the disappearance of the talisman.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If the check succeeds, the talisman remains with the character for 5d6 hours, or until a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wish.html#_wish" >wish</a></i> is made with it, whichever comes first. It then disappears.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If the check roll is a natural 20, the talisman remains for a number of months equal to the character's Charisma score, resisting any effort to get rid of it by reappearing in the character's possession, in a back pocket, at the bottom of his pack, or the like. </p>

The second method is similar to the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift" >plane shift</a></i> spell, though the egg can move to any plane it desires (it needs no focus) and when the egg <i>plane shifts</i> so do all creatures currently within it.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The egg has its own quirky, unabashed personality and can telepathically communicate with all creatures inside it or within 100 feet, regardless of language. The <i>Brazen Egg's</i> chief goal is to disrupt that plans of Hell's archdevils, but it requires the help of other creatures to do so. It often trades its ability to teleport and <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/planeShift.html#_plane-shift" >plane shift</a></i> in order to gain such aid, but in dire circumstances it has the ability to enchant creatures in order to achieve its goals&mdash;and when it is close to reaching its goals it has little compunction in doing so. Once per day, the egg can affect a single creature within it as per the spell <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dominatePerson.html#_dominate-person" >dominate person</a></i> (though it is not limited to humanoids and can affect any living creature).

<p id="celestial-lens" class="stat-block-title">Celestial Lens</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong evocation; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 2,400 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The celestial lens is a 12-foot-diameter lens mounted in a rune-covered circular frame of strange, alien metal, floating in a permanent orbit around a temple dedicated to the sun. Several smaller lenses of similar design hover around the primary lens like a bizarre orrery, moving into place to focus the arcane rays of the device. The <i>celestial lens</i> was created to capture the light of sacred eclipses and solar conjunctions, as well as the refracted darkness found between stars.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Celestial rays can be directed in an extremely powerful beam of energy that manifests as a vertical column of searing light focused directly below the celestial lens. Depending on the will of the controller and GM adjudication for inclement weather, such blasts deal between 5d6 and 20d6 points of damage in a 5-foot-radius cylinder extending from the lens to the ground or target. During the day, half the damage is fire damage, but the other half results directly from divine power and is therefore not reduced by resistance to fire-based attacks. At night, the device focuses distant starlight, and the maximum damage is only 10d6, although the lens does not function at all for 1 hour before sunrise and 1 hour after sunset. The lens moves with a constant speed of 20 feet and damages everything caught in the affected areas each round. Victims may make a DC 25 Reflex save for half damage.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The lens orbits at a static height of 100 feet from the ground and moves at a speed of 20 feet per round. It cannot be stopped or accelerated, although the path of the transit can be altered by a user in possession of the <i>flame of <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/guidance.html#_guidance" >guidance</a></i>. When not directed, the lens maintains its last commanded path, eventually curving into a new elliptical orbit around its temple, scorching a path through whatever lies below. The user can alter both the damage (up to the maximum for the current lighting conditions) and the orbit in any direction, but the lens must move 20 feet each round, and cannot travel more than 3 miles from the temple in any direction before it curves back around and begins returning. Only divine intervention or powerful magic like <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/wish.html#_wish" >wish</a> </i>or <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/miracle.html#_miracle" >miracle</a></i> can overcome this limited range, making a new person or place the center of the lens's orbit.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The light of a full moon must be focused through the celestial lens at maximum intensity on a flawless silver mirror no less than 10 feet in diameter (DC 20 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> [glass] to cast). The doubly reflected light shatters the otherwise indestructible glass of the celestial lens, causing the whole lens to tumble to the ground.</p>

<p id="cloud-castle-of-the-storm-king" class="stat-block-title">Cloud Castle Of The Storm King</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong (all schools); <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once the fortress of a legendary tyrant known only as the Storm King, this castle now wanders the known universe, sometimes at the whim of its master, but often as a drifting and aimless haunt of powerful monsters, ignorant of&mdash;or unable to tap into&mdash;its fantastic power.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This grand and opulent castle is held aloft and propelled by a foundation of storm clouds constantly rumbling with thunder and crackling with electrical storms. Atop the massive storm cloud, the castle is shaped like a square, with 80-foot guard towers at each corner. At its center is a 140-foot tower with seven levels and more than 30 chambers. The central tower is well appointed with many halls, living chambers, suites, privies, kitchens (with pantries that magically replenish food stores every fortnight), and laboratories suitable for arcane and alchemical study. Each guard tower has living chambers and barracks for up to 25 guards, and one tower has an adjoining stable that can hold up to a dozen griffons, hippogriffs, pegasi, or even terrestrial mounts. In all, the tower can comfortably support a population of 300 Medium creatures. </p>
<p class="stat-block">In order to fully take control of the castle, a creature must be at least 17th level, and must have the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/feats.html#_leadership" >Leadership</a> feat and 17 ranks in <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (arcana). If the castle already has a master, that master must be defeated before another can take her place. The castle's movement is controlled by way of a control chamber located at the heart (a central chamber on its 4th floor). There, a font of pure elemental water serves as a scrying device for the castle's master, though it can view only places inside the castle or within 100 feet of it. The master (or a person she designates) can direct the castle's motion from within the chamber. It has a fly speed of 250 feet (clumsy) and uses the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/fly.html#_fly" >Fly</a> skill modifier of the person controlling its motion; the castle can hover without needing to make a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/fly.html#_fly" >Fly</a> check and never risks falling due to a failed check. When not being controlled, the castle moves randomly, sometimes changing direction every minute, sometimes holding the same course for days at a time, but always avoiding the ground or other hazards. It has the ability to travel to other planes, though no master other than the Storm King is known to have invoked this power. The master of the castle gains the following spell-like abilities.</p>
<ul><li><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/callLightningStorm.html#_call-lightning-storm" >Call lightning storm</a></i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber or one of the towers to use this ability.</li>
<li><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/guardsAndWards.html#_guards-and-wards" >Guards and wards</a></i> 1/day on the central tower.</li>
<li><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/stormOfVengeance.html#_storm-of-vengeance" >Storm of vengeance</a></i> 1/day. The master must be in the control chamber to use this ability, and the storm rains down from the castle's cloudy base upon everything within range underneath (2,200 feet).</li>
<li><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/windWall.html#_wind-wall" >Wind wall</a></i> at will. This effect surrounds the entire castle at a range of 100 feet, and can be raised or lowered by the master (or a creature he or she designates) from the control room or any tower as a standard action.</li></ul>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The <i>Cloud Castle of the Storm King</i> can only be destroyed if it is dissipated by suitably strong winds; the only winds that can dissipate it are found only in the most turbulent reaches of the Plane of Air (of course, as nobody knows how to make it travel between planes, those wishing to destroy it must find it on the Plane of Air to have any chance to do so). Any other attacks may cause walls to collapse or even side towers to break loose, but the central chamber and the floors beneath it will continue to exist in a ruined form over a smaller storm cloud as long as this destruction condition is not met.</p>

Anyone opening the <i>Codex </i>for the first time is utterly annihilated, as with a <i>destruction</i> spell (Fortitude DC 30). Those who survive can peruse its pages and learn its powers, though not without risk. Each day spent studying the <i>Codex </i>allows the reader to make a Spellcraft check (DC 50) to learn one of its powers (choose the power learned randomly; add a +1 circumstance bonus on the check per additional day spent reading until a power is learned). However, each day of study also forces the reader to make a Will save (DC 30 + 1 per day of study) to avoid being driven insane (as the <i>insanity</i> spell). The powers of the <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>are as follows: <i>astral projection ,  banishment ,  elemental swarm ,  gate ,  greater planar ally ,  greater planar binding ,  plane shift , </i>and <i>soul bind . </i>Each of these spell-like abilities are usable at will by the owner of the <i>Codex </i>(assuming that he or she has learned how to access the power). The <i>Codex of the Infinite Planes </i>has a caster level of 30th for the purposes of all powers and catastrophes, and all saving throw DCs are 20 + spell level. Activating any power requires a Spellcraft check (DC 40 + twice the spell level of the power; the character can't take 10 on this check). Any failure on either check indicates that a catastrophe befalls the user (roll on the table below for the effect). A character can incur only one catastrophe per power use. </p>

<ul><li><i>Summon Shadows</i>: Three times per day the staff may summon 2d4 shadows. Immune to turning, they serve the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster V</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li>
<li><i>Summon Nightshade</i>: Once per month, the staff can summon an advanced shadow demon that serves the wielder as if called by a <i>summon monster IX</i> spell cast at 20th level.</li>
<li><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-shadow" >Shadow</a> Form</i>: Three times per day the wielder can become a living shadow, with all the movement powers granted by <i>gaseous form</i>. </li>
<li><i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/armor.html#_armor-shadow" >Shadow</a> Bolt</i>: Three times per day the staff can project a ray attack that deals 10d6 points of cold damage to a single target. The shadow bolt has a range of 100 feet.</li></ul>
<p class="stat-block">The <i>Shadowstaff</i> fades away to nothingness if it is exposed to true sunlight for a continuous 24 hour period.</p>				

<p id="the-shield-of-the-sun" class="stat-block-title">The Shield of the Sun</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b>Aura</b> strong abjuration; <b>CL</b> 20th; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This <i>+5 Large <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield" >shield</a></i>, emblazoned with the symbol of the sun, allows the wielder to cast spells as if she were a 20th-level paladin with a Charisma of 20. The spells gained are cumulative with any existing spells per day the character might have, even from paladin class levels. The <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield" >Shield</a> of the Sun</i> also grants its wielder spell resistance 15. It absorbs the first 10 points of damage from any energy attack (fire, cold, acid, electricity, or sonic). In return for all this, once per year the shield's owner must undertake a quest at the behest of a lawful good deity (no saving throw to avoid). </p>
<p class="stat-block">A chaotic or evil character gains four negative levels when wielding the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield" >Shield</a> of the Sun</i>. The negative levels persist as long as the shield is in hand and cannot be overcome in any way (including <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/restoration.html#_restoration" >restoration</a></i> spells). The negative levels disappear when the shield is stowed or leaves the wearer's possession.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block-1">The <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/shield.html#_shield" >Shield</a> of the Sun</i> may be destroyed if a good-aligned character casts it into the Well of Eternal Night, its light fading into the inky depths before it finally disappears. If a nongood character does the deed, the shield is not destroyed, merely lost, and a quest to the Plane of Shadow may recover it.</p>

<p id="skullsoul" class="stat-block-title">Skullsoul</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Slot</b> None; <b> AURA</b> strong necromancy; <b>CL </b>18th; <b>Weight</b> 8 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This grim, alabaster figurine is the size of a human skull with an elaborately sculpted base. The <i>Skullsoul</i> is inert until it is bonded with a living creature. It then becomes a powerful and never-questioning companion. The <i>Skullsoul</i> functions as a demilich without the devour soul, rejuvenation, telekinetic storm, and torpor abilities, and with a hardness of 10. It is under the complete control of whoever bonds with the skull. Bonding with the <i>Skullsoul</i> is a ritual that takes 24 hours to perform, and doing so is an evil act. Paladins and good clerics who do so become ex-paladins and ex-clerics respectively. If they wish to atone, they must intercede with their deities (expending 2,500 gp in rare incense and offerings) and must promise to contain the skull.</p>
<p class="stat-block-breaker"><b>Destruction</b></p>
<p class="stat-block">The <i>Skullsoul</i> cannot be destroyed but it can be contained. As long as the <i>Skullsoul</i> stays pierced by either a weapon with the <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_vorpal" >vorpal</a></i> special ability or a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_holy-avenger" >holy avenger</a></i>, it is contained and entirely inert until the sword is removed.</p>
