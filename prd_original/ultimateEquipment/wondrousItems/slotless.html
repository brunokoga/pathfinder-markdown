<h1 id="slotless-wondrous-items">Slotless Wondrous Items</h1>
<p>These wondrous items do not adhere to a specific slot, and are often carried by a character in a way similar to a potion or wand, worn on some part of the body that doesn't correspond to an item slot, or are otherwise utilized in a particular way detailed in the item's description. Slotless wondrous items range through the gamut of appearances and functions, and, generally, if a magic item doesn't fit into any other category it appears here.</p>
<p>Anyone can use slotless wondrous items unless specified otherwise by its description. These wondrous items are usually use-activated or triggered by a command word, but details vary from item to item. </p>

<p class="stat-block">Carried in a tube of beaten silver, this rough-ground salt is a powerful defense against evil conjurers. As a full-round action that provokes attacks of opportunity, the salt can be poured in a circle with a diameter of 5 feet or a straight line up to 15 feet long. While the line of salt remains unbroken and undisturbed, evil summoned or called creatures cannot physically cross it or interfere with it. These creatures can continue to make ranged or magical attacks over the line. Any other creature may disturb the line simply by scuffing it. The effects of the salt last as long as the line remains unbroken. Once laid, the salt cannot be recollected.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This stuffed rag doll might resemble a child's toy if not for the vital organs depicted on its cloth. By dabbing the doll with a few drops of blood from a living creature (a standard action), the bearer can form a sympathetic link between the doll and the victim. If the chosen victim has spell resistance, the doll must beat the target's spell resistance to create the link. As a standard action, the bearer can twist or stab the doll; this gives the target the sickened condition for one round and deals 1 point of negative energy damage plus 1 point for each die of the doll bearer's sneak attack damage (if any). Each time the target is affected by the doll, it receives a DC 14 Will save to end the link. The doll's holder needs line of effect to the victim, but not line of sight. Once linked to a particular creature, an <i>anatomy doll </i>cannot be linked to another creature, but the bearer can re-establish a broken link by anointing it with more of the target's blood. </p>

The image reacts when questioned, with the creature turning to face the viewer and responding appropriately. The image is a magical effect with no actual intelligence, but is programmed with up to ten 25-word verbal responses and can respond to questions if these responses seem appropriate. For example, if one of the programmed responses is the name of the person shown in the portrait, it can answer questions such as "who are you?" and "what is your name?" If the item crafter is familiar with or has the cooperation of the creature depicted in the painting, the illusory image has the voice and mannerisms of that creature.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This appears to be a common cloth sack about 2 feet by 4 feet in size. The <i>bag of holding</i> opens into a nondimensional space: its inside is larger than its outside dimensions. Regardless of what is put into the bag, it weighs a fixed amount. This weight, and the limits in weight and volume of the bag's contents, depend on the bag's type, as shown on the table below.</p>

<p class="stat-block">If a <i>bag of holding</i> is overloaded, or if sharp objects pierce it (from inside or outside), the bag immediately ruptures and is ruined, and all contents are lost forever. If a <i>bag of holding</i> is turned inside out, all of its contents spill out, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. If living creatures are placed within the bag, they can survive for up to 10 minutes, after which time they suffocate. Retrieving a specific item from a <i>bag of holding</i> is a move action, unless the bag contains more than an ordinary backpack would hold, in which case retrieving a specific item is a full-round action. Magic items placed inside the bag do not offer any benefit to the character carrying the bag.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This small black sphere appears to be a lusterless pearl. A <i>bead of force</i> can be thrown up to 60 feet with no range penalties. Upon sharp impact, the bead explodes, sending forth a burst that deals 5d6 points of force damage to all creatures within a 10-foot radius.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Once thrown, a <i>bead of force</i> functions like a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/resilientSphere.html#_resilient-sphere" >resilient sphere</a></i> spell (Reflex DC 16 negates) with a radius of 10 feet and a duration of 10 minutes. A globe of shimmering force encloses the targeted creature, provided the latter is small enough to fit within the diameter of the sphere. The sphere contains its subject for the spell's duration. The sphere is not subject to damage of any sort except from a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-cancellation" >rod of cancellation</a></i>, a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rods.html#_rod-of-negation" >rod of negation</a></i>, <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate" >disintegrate</a></i>, or a targeted <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/dispelMagic.html#_dispel-magic" >dispel magic</a></i> spell. These effects destroy the sphere without harm to the subject. Nothing can pass through the sphere, inside or out, though the subject can breathe normally. The subject may struggle, but the globe cannot be physically moved either by people outside it or by the struggles of those within.

<p class="stat-block">This sticky henna paste is used to stamp a rust-colored handprint onto the body of a familiar or animal companion, and a hoof, claw, or paw print from that creature onto its master. These brands demonstrate a bond of friendship and balance, not ownership and subservience. Applying the brand requires a full-round action each for master and companion. The brand enhances the share spells ability of druids, wizards, and other classes with animal companions or familiars, allowing these characters to cast spells with a range of personal or touch on the marked companion at a range of 30 feet, provided the character has line of effect to the creature. Each spell cast at range in this way drains one charge from the <i>beast-bond <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/spells/brand.html#_brand" >brand</a></i> for each spell level of the spell cast. A newly applied <i>beast-bond <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/advanced/spells/brand.html#_brand" >brand</a></i> has 10 charges. When all charges are consumed, the brand vanishes. For the purposes of teleportation spells and effects, the master may treat a marked companion as an object or a creature, whichever is more favorable (weight restrictions still apply).</p>

<p class="stat-block">This dark gem attunes itself to the soul of its bearer. When carried close to the body of a creature continuously for 1 week, the gem harmlessly absorbs a portion of that creature's life essence. If separated from its bearer for at least 1 day, the gem loses this attunement. If the bearer gains one or more negative levels, the <i>black soul shard</i> absorbs one of these negative levels into itself, negating the effect. The <i>black soul shard</i> can only absorb a negative level if carried by the person it is attuned to.  If an attuned <i>black soul shard </i>is used as an additional focus component for raising the attuned creature from the dead, the negative level cost of being raised is one less than normal (minimum 1), but only if the spell is cast within 24 hours of the creature's death.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Absorbing a negative level (whether from an attack or raising the attuned creature from the dead) destroys the portion of the soul within a <i>black soul shard</i>. This does not harm the creature, but requires re-attuning the gem for another week for it to function again. A creature can only have one <i>black soul shard</i> attuned to it at a time.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This blown-glass vial has a chain for attaching it to the handle of a weapon. When filled with the wearer's blood, it gains powerful magic. Filling the reservoir takes a full minute, deals 4 points of Constitution damage (which can be healed normally), and imbues the reservoir with 4 charges. Charging the reservoir changes the blood to magical fluid, which does not clot or decay with time.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The wearer can speak the first command word to draw 1 or more charges from the reservoir, curing 1 point of physical ability score damage per charge used.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The wearer can speak the second command word to imbue herself with a great burst of physical prowess, depleting all remaining charges and gaining an inherent bonus to one physical ability score equal to twice the number of charges used.

A bearer can safely carry only one charged reservoir at a time; any others spontaneously drain their charges in 1d10 rounds, leaving only the highest-charged reservoir intact.

If used to perform a coup de grace on a helpless living creature and the creature dies from the attack, the creature's flesh begins to peel off and its bones animate as a skeleton under the command of the bearer of the razor. The creature's flesh is not destroyed, but decays at a steady rate. The bearer of the razor can spend 1 minute reattaching the flesh to the animate skeleton, which ends the necromantic magic and results in a normal corpse (though a corpse of a person killed or mutilated by knife wounds). If the bearer uses the razor to flense and animate another creature's bones, the previous animate skeleton is immediately destroyed.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This item appears to be a normal glass bottle with a cork. When taken to any airless environment, it retains air within it at all times, continually renewing its contents. This means that a character can draw air out of the bottle to breathe. The bottle can even be shared by multiple characters who pass it around. Breathing out of the bottle is a standard action, but a character so doing can then act for as long as she can hold her breath.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This green glass bottle has a tiny winding key on its elongated stem that, if turned, causes a shadowy cork to slowly become substantial over a 1-round period. Anything the owner of the bottle speaks into the bottle during this time (up to 25 words) gets trapped inside it once the cork fully manifests. As soon as the cork is removed or the bottle is smashed, this message is released exactly as if the owner had spoken the words at that moment. Once the bottle releases its message, it shatters.</p>

When turned upside down, the bottle summons a shadow to do the bidding of the user, draining 1 charge each round of service. As a standard action, the bearer may dismiss the summoned shadow. If the shadow kills a humanoid creature of at least 4 HD, the bottle gains 1 charge. The bottle is automatically restored to 4 charges at sundown.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This leather bottle is filled to the brim with frothy green liquid. As a full-round action, a witch can target the bottle with any hex (but not a greater or grand hex) she knows that targets a single creature, transferring its effects to the brew within, which congeals into a sticky syrup. Any creature can use this syrup as a dose of injury poison (including the 5% chance to affect the user if she does not possess the poison use class feature). Any creature struck by a weapon coated in this syrup must save against the hex (DC 15) or be affected as if the witch had targeted them with the hex directly. The syrup counts as a poison and is a magical effect. If the hex cannot affect a target more than once every 24 hours, subsequent doses of the syrup are similarly ineffective against that target. Once imbued with the power of a hex, the syrup lasts for 24 hours before reverting into useless, harmless liquid.</p>

<p class="stat-block">A <i>chime of opening</i> is a hollow mithral tube about 1 foot long. When struck, it sends forth magical vibrations that cause locks, lids, doors, valves, and portals to open. The device functions against normal bars, shackles, chains, bolts, and so on. A <i>chime of opening</i> also automatically dispels a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/holdPortal.html#_hold-portal" >hold portal</a></i> spell or even an <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/arcaneLock.html#_arcane-lock" >arcane lock</a></i> cast by a spellcaster of lower than 15th level.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The chime must be pointed at the item or gate to be loosed or opened (which must be visible and known to the user). The chime is then struck and a clear tone rings forth. The wielder can then make a caster level check against the lock or binding, using the chime's caster level in place of her own. The DC of this check is equal to the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/disableDevice.html#_disable-device" >Disable Device</a> DC to open the lock or binding. Each sounding only opens one form of locking, so if a chest is chained, padlocked, locked, and arcane locked, it takes four successful uses of a <i>chime of opening</i> to get it open.

<p class="stat-block">This container of sickly gray paste can coat the armor of one Medium or two Small creatures. Affected objects produce dark gray fumes for the next 24 hours. These fumes cause natural plants to wilt and diminish as soon as they come into contact with the affected armor. This allows the wearer to move through terrain made difficult due to the presence of vegetation as if it were normal terrain, though the creature leaves a clear path of ruined vegetation. In addition, creatures belonging to the plant type that target someone protected by <i>defoliant polish</i> with a natural attack or grapple take 1 point of damage with each successful attack or each round they maintain the grapple.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This horn is bound with fittings of gold and decorated with ornate carvings depicting scenes of glorious battle. A fully charged horn has 3 charges&mdash;charges used are automatically renewed each day. So long as the horn has at least one charge remaining, it's owner can command it to fill with mead or a similar alcoholic drink. A creature can spend one or more charges while drinking from the horn to gain the following benefits:</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>1 charge</i>: The drinker gains 1d8 temporary hit points (as if from an <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/aid.html#_aid" >aid</a></i> spell), which last for 1 minute.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>2 charges</i>: The drinker gains 1d8+5 temporary hit points and is enlarged, as the spell <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/enlargePerson.html#_enlarge-person" >enlarge person</a></i>, for 5 minutes.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>3 charges</i>: The drinker gains 1d8+10 temporary hit points, is enlarged for 10 minutes, and gains the benefit of a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/heroism.html#_heroism" >heroism</a></i> spell for as long as she is enlarged. </p>
<p class="stat-block">A creature must drink deeply from the horn to receive its full benefit. Using 1 charge is similar to drinking a potion&mdash;it takes a standard action and provokes an attack of opportunity (though certain abilities can reduce the action required). To use 2 charges, the drinker must spend a full round drinking from the horn, which always provokes and attack of opportunity. To use all 3 charges, the drinker must spend 2 full-round actions drinking from the horn. </p>

<p class="stat-block">This horn holds 20 doses of black powder for firearms. When a firearm is loaded with black powder directly from this horn, the horn creates a small pocket of air that envelops the gun and allows that shot to be fired underwater or in an area lacking air, such as a vacuum. Once the gun is loaded with powder from the <i>dry load powder horn</i>, it retains the pocket of air for 10 minutes or until the firearm is fired, whichever comes first.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Firing a firearm that has been loaded from this horn underwater still incurs the &ndash;2 penalty on attack rolls for every 5 feet of water the bullet passes through, in addition to the normal penalties to range.

<p class="stat-block">This brown dust is similar to <i>dust of dryness</i>, but affects acid rather than water and absorbs less liquid. If it is thrown into acid, a volume of as much as 10 gallons is instantly transformed into nothingness, and the dust becomes a marble sized pellet floating or resting where it was thrown. If this pellet is hurled, it breaks and releases the same volume of acid, dealing 1d6 points of acid damage per gallon absorbed into the pellet (maximum 4d6), affecting all creatures within a 30-foot radius of its point of impact. This is a splash weapon.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If the dust is used against an ooze that deals acid damage with its attacks, the creature must make a DC 18 Fortitude save or be destroyed. The dust deals 5d6 points of damage to the ooze even if its saving throw succeeds.</p>

<p class="stat-block">One application of the dust sprinkled over an object increases the target's weight by 100 pounds. Multiple applications stack, and the effect remains until the object is scrubbed clean of the metallic particles (taking a full-round action per application) or it takes 5 points of electricity damage per application.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A creature struck directly with a thrown flask must make a Fortitude save (DC 10 + 1 per application remaining in the flask) or gain heavy encumbrance and be unable to fly for 2d4 rounds.

The second slightly longer compartment holds up to 18 objects of the same general size and shape as a javelin. The third and longest portion of the case contains as many as 6 objects of the same general size and shape as a bow (spears, staffs, or the like). Once the owner has filled it, the quiver can quickly produce any item she wishes that is within the quiver, as if from a regular quiver or scabbard. The <i>efficient quiver</i> weighs the same no matter what's placed inside it.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This item is typically fashioned of brass or bronze, with a lead stopper bearing special seals. Periodically, a thin stream of bitter-smelling smoke issues from the bottle's top. The bottle can be opened once per day. When opened, the efreeti imprisoned within issues from the bottle instantly amid a cloud of noxious smoke. There is a 10% chance (01&ndash;10 on d%) that the efreeti is insane and attacks immediately upon being released. There is also a 10% chance (91&ndash;100) that the efreeti of the bottle grants three wishes. In either case, afterward the efreeti disappears forever, and the bottle becomes nonmagical. The other 80% of the time (11&ndash;90), the inhabitant of the bottle loyally serves the character for up to 10 minutes per day (or until the efreeti's death), doing as she commands. Roll each day the bottle is opened for that day's effect.</p>

This lasts 24 hours. To activate the fetish, the ranger must spend 10 minutes quietly holding it; he then may select one of his favored enemies to replace with the item's favored enemy. For example, a ranger with a +6 favored enemy bonus against orcs may use a dragon-hating fetish, gaining a +6 favored enemy bonus against dragons and losing the bonus against orcs for 24 hours. Alternatively, once per day, the bearer can activate the fetish as a swift action, but its effects only last 10 minutes and the bearer only gains half his favored enemy bonus (for example, the ranger would lose his orc bonus and only gain a +3 favored enemy bonus against dragons for 10 minutes).</p>

<li><i>The Goat of Terror</i>: When called upon with the proper command word, this statuette becomes a destrier-like mount with the statistics of a light horse. However, its rider can employ the goat's horns as weapons (one horn as a <i>+3 heavy lance</i>, the other as a <i>+5 longsword</i>).

The statuette can be used once per week for one continuous period of up to 24 hours. Note that when an obsidian steed becomes ethereal or plane shifts, its rider and his gear follow suit. Thus, the user can travel to other planes via this means.

When activated, the figurine sprouts longer, segmented legs, and scampers about the bearer, picking lint off robes, chiseling grime from armor, or otherwise grooming the bearer. If commanded to do so (a free action), it perches on the muzzle of a one-handed or two-handed firearm barrel and, after the firearm is fired, travels down the barrel and cleans out the firearm.

Yet when the proper command word is given, the box unfolds itself rapidly in the space of a single round to form a boat 10 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 2 feet in depth. A second command word causes it to unfold even further into a ship 24 feet long, 8 feet wide, and 6 feet deep. The <i>folding boat</i> cannot unfold if there isn't enough open space for it to occupy once unfolded. Any objects formerly stored in the box now rest inside the boat or ship.</p>
<p class="stat-block">In its smaller form, the boat has one pair of oars, an anchor, a mast, and a lateen sail.

By gently heating a potion or extract in the alembic for 1 hour, the device creates a few drops of magical liquid.

Its flickering light shines from the skull's eye sockets, casting light as a bullseye lantern. On command, the lantern can consume its soulstuff in a sudden blast of heat, as <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/burningHands.html#_burning-hands" >burning hands</a></i>. Doing so extinguishes the lantern. Whenever a living creature with at least 1 HD is slain within 30 feet of an empty <i>grim lantern</i>, the lantern absorbs a fragment of that creature's soul, restoring its glow.</p>

<p class="stat-block">A backpack of this sort appears to be well made, well used, and quite ordinary. It has two side pouches, each of which appears large enough to hold about a quart of material. In fact, each is like a <i>bag of holding</i> and can actually hold material of as much as 2 cubic feet in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion of the pack can contain up to 8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack always weighs only 5 pounds.</p>
<p class="stat-block">While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a move action, but it does not provoke the attacks of opportunity that retrieving a stored item usually does.</p>

Its powers only function if the wearer of the shield or armor has the channel energy and smite abilities.

<p class="stat-block">This metal cube is small, but when activated by speaking a command word it grows to form a tower 20 feet square and 30 feet high, with arrow slits on all sides and a crenellated battlement atop it. The metal walls extend 10 feet into the ground, rooting it to the spot and preventing it from being tipped over.

<p class="stat-block">These crystalline stones always float in the air and must be within 3 feet of their owner to be of any use. When a character first acquires a stone, she must hold it and then release it, whereupon it takes up a circling orbit 1d3 feet from her head. Thereafter, a stone must be grasped or netted to separate it from its owner. The owner may voluntarily seize and stow a stone (to keep it safe while she is sleeping, for example), but she loses the benefits of the stone during that time. <i>Ioun stones</i> have AC 24, 10 hit points, and hardness 5. The powers of each stone vary depending on its color and shape (see the table on page 306).</p>
<p class="stat-block">Regeneration from the <i>pearly white ioun stone</i> works like a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/rings.html#_ring-of-regeneration" >ring of regeneration</a></i>.

<p class="stat-block">These special containers are typically inlaid with runes of silver and stoppered by a brass plug bearing a seal engraved with sigils, glyphs, and special symbols. When the user speaks the command word, he can force any creature from another plane into the container, provided that creature fails a DC 19 Will save. The range of this effect is 60 feet. Only one creature at a time can be so contained. Loosing the stopper frees the captured creature.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The command word can be used only once per day.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If the individual freeing the captured creature speaks the command word, the creature can be forced to serve for 1 hour. If freed without the command word, the creature acts according to its natural inclinations. (It usually attacks the user, unless it perceives a good reason not to.) Any attempt to force the same creature into the flask a second time provides it a +2 bonus on its saving throw and makes it hostile.

Adding charges to the badge is a standard action (regardless of the spell level expended).

<p class="stat-block">A <i>lord's banner</i> is a cloth flag or standard, typically at least 2 feet wide and 4 feet long (though some are up to twice that size), meant to be carried and displayed on a lance, polearm, frame, or staff. It has no effect when not mounted properly or when laying on the ground. It normally depicts the insignia or heraldic symbol of a particular noble.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A <i>lord's banner</i> may be carried (on foot or mounted) or planted. In the latter case, the banner does not need a bearer, but if it is toppled or touched by an enemy, it loses its effectiveness until reclaimed and replanted by allies of its owner.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Crusades </i>(evocation aura): A noble-looking <i>lord's banner of crusades</i> emits a hallow effect in a 40-foot radius around it, so long as it is borne by one true to the religion of the person whose crest is on the banner (these sorts of banners usually have a holy symbol or other religious insignia worked into the design).</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Swiftness </i>(abjuration aura): A group or army that are traveling under a <i>lord's banner of swiftness</i> can make a forced march without needing Constitution checks or suffering any nonlethal damage from doing so, allowing them to cover great distances while still arriving ready to do battle. This ability affects all allied creatures within 1 mile as long as they are able to see the banner at least once a day.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Terror </i>(necromancy aura): Enemies of the bearer of a <i>lord's banner of terror</i>, while within 30 feet and able to see the banner, must make a DC 16 Will save or become panicked, fleeing as quickly as possible for as long as they can see the banner. Those that succeed on the save are shaken. A creature that makes its saving throw cannot be panicked by the banner for 24 hours.</p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Victory </i>(evocation aura): Allies of the owner of a <i>lord's banner of victory</i> gain a +2 morale bonus on attack rolls, saves, and skill checks for as long as they can see the banner.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This magical instrument is usually made of gold and inlaid with numerous gems. If the proper chords are struck, a single use of this lyre negates any attacks made against inanimate construction (walls, roof, floor, and so on) within 300 feet. This includes the effects of a <i>horn of blasting</i>, a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/disintegrate.html#_disintegrate" >disintegrate</a></i> spell, or an attack from a ram or similar siege weapon. The lyre can be used in this way once per day, with the protection lasting for 30 minutes.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The lyre is also useful with respect to building. Once a week, its strings can be strummed so as to produce chords that magically construct buildings, mines, tunnels, ditches, etc. The effect produced in 30 minutes of playing is equal to the work of 100 humans laboring for 3 days. Each hour after the first, a character playing the lyre must make a DC 18 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perform.html#_perform" >Perform</a> (string instruments) check. If she fails, she must stop and cannot play the lyre again for this purpose until a week has passed.</p>

A created fence post can penetrate earth, and the other materials can penetrate earth, wood, or stone.

<p class="stat-block">These pigments enable their possessor to create actual, permanent objects simply by depicting their form in two dimensions. The pigments are applied by a stick tipped with bristles, hair, or fur. The emulsion flows from the application to form the desired object as the artist concentrates on the image.

<p class="stat-block">Only normal, inanimate objects can be created. Creatures can't be created. The pigments must be applied to a surface.

The bell has no clapper; to ring it, the bearer must attack it with an unarmed strike (this counts as an attack, with no attack roll needed, and does not damage the bell).

<p class="stat-block">This small locker is carved from fossilized wood and it is usually found chained and sealed. When the locker is unsealed and opened, the migrus&mdash;a desiccated hairless cat with a humanoid face&mdash;is found within. After a few moments the migrus animates and begins to clean itself, and its face begins to take the appearance of the creature who opened the <i>migrus locker</i>. The migrus considers the last creature to release it from the locker is its master.</p>
<p class="stat-block">The migrus moves in a strange jerky motion. It obeys simple verbal commands from its master. The migrus takes a very literal and brutal approach to problem solving and is fond of taking trophies. If the migrus is slain, it decays messily overnight in a glistening slick of putrid fluid. At the next dawn, the migrus reconstitutes within its locker (if the locker is opened before dawn, the partially-reconstituted migrus is visible inside, consuming the remnants of its former body.</p>

If the image is struck by the attack, it shatters with a resounding crash. The creature that destroyed the image is subject to bad luck; the next time it makes an attack roll or saving throw, it must roll twice and take the worse result.

<p class="stat-block">This crystal device is usually about 4 feet square and framed in metal or wood. The frame typically depicts dragons, demons, devils, genies, coiling nagas, or other powerful creatures that are well known for their magical powers. It can be hung or placed on a surface and then activated by giving a command word. The same command word deactivates the mirror. A <i>mirror of life trapping</i> has 15 extradimensional compartments within it. Any creature coming within 30 feet of the device and looking at its own reflection must make a DC 23 Will save or be trapped within the mirror in one of the cells. A creature not aware of the nature of the device always sees its own reflection. The probability of a creature seeing its reflection, and thus needing to make the saving throw, drops to 50% if the creature is aware that the mirror traps life and seeks to avoid looking at it (treat as a gaze attack).</p>
<p class="stat-block">When a creature is trapped, it is taken bodily into the mirror. Size is not a factor, but constructs and undead are not trapped, nor are inanimate objects and other nonliving matter. A victim's equipment (including clothing and anything being carried) remains behind. If the mirror's owner knows the right command word, he can call the reflection of any creature trapped within to its surface and engage his powerless prisoner in conversation. Another command word frees the trapped creature. Each pair of command words is specific to each prisoner.</p>
<p class="stat-block">If the mirror's capacity is exceeded, one victim (determined randomly) is set free in order to accommodate the latest one. If the mirror is destroyed (hardness 1, 5 hit points), all victims currently trapped in it are freed.</p>

<ul><li>Read the thoughts of any creature reflected therein, as long as the creature controlling the mirror is within 25 feet of the mirror, even if those thoughts are in an unknown language.</li>
<li>View other places as if with <i>clairvoyance</i>, and the controller can even view locations on other planes if she is sufficiently familiar with them.</li>
<li>Use it as a portal to visit other places. The controller first views the place with the <i>clairvoyance</i> function, then steps through the mirror to the place pictured. Others can follow her through the mirror if they like. An invisible portal remains on the other side where she arrives, and she can return through that portal. Once she returns, the portal closes. The portal closes on its own after 24 hours (trapping the user if she's still in the other place), and the user can also close it with a command word. Creatures with Intelligence scores of 12 or higher might notice the portal just as they might notice a magical sensor from a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/scrying.html#_scrying" >scrying</a></i> spell.

Her skin becomes scaly, her eyes slitted and reptilian, her tongue forked, and her neck lengthens and distends until it resembles a cobra's hood.

<p class="stat-block">This fist sized chunk of off-white stone seems too large to fit inside a human's mouth, but may be swallowed with ease as a standard action. Once ingested, the gut-stone remains active for up to a week, maneuvering itself within the body to protect its bearer's vital organs. Any time an attack would subject the bearer to precision-based damage (such as a critical hit or sneak attack), that damage is instead directed to the gut-stone. All other damage from the triggering attack, as well as damage that surpasses the gut-stone's hit points, is applied to the character normally. A gut-stone has 10 hit points and hardness 0.</p>
<p class="stat-block">When a gut-stone is damaged by a melee weapon attack, as a free action its owner may sacrifice the stone to damage the attacker's weapon. Treat this as the bearer making a free sunder combat maneuver against the weapon, except that it does not provoke an attack of opportunity, bypasses the weapon's hardness, and deals 1d4 points of damage.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Only one gut-stone may be in a creature's body at a time. Any attempt to swallow a second destroys both stones and forces the creature to make a DC 15 Fortitude save or be sickened for 1 round.

If the nest is placed on the floor or ground, each time a creature passes through that square there is a 50% chance that it kicks or steps on the nest, triggering it. The nest may instead be thrown (range increment 10 feet), triggering when it strikes a hard surface or a creature. When triggered, the nest creates a wasp swarm that attacks the nearest creature and follows it until it is dead, the swarm is killed, or the swarm is unable to reach the target, at which point the swarm attacks the next nearest creature. If the swarm can't find any targets, it waits in place until another creature appears. The swarm dissipates 9 minutes after being released.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This small lacquered box made from exotic and colorful woods contains five vials and a single dropper. The vials are labeled "glass," "iron," "paper," "stone," and "wood," and each contains a magical fluid that permanently transforms solid objects it touches into that material. Administering the fluid requires the included dropper, is a standard action, and provokes an attack of opportunity (similar to drinking a potion, and the attacker can strike at the dropper instead of the bearer). For example, using the vial marked "paper" on a lock transforms the lock into paper, with all of the various properties of paper (hardness, hit points, flammability, and so on). If the target object has a volume of one cubic foot or less, the transformation occurs instantly. Larger objects slowly transform at a rate of 1 hour per cubic foot of material (maximum 10 cubic feet affected). Each vial contains 5 applications of that particular fluid. Magical and attended objects may resist this transformation with a successful DC 17 Fortitude save.</p>

Anything placed within it is immediately cast to another world&mdash;a parallel world, another planet, or a different plane (chosen randomly). If the well is moved, it opens to a new plane (also randomly determined). It can be picked up, folded, or rolled, just as a <i>portable hole</i> can be. Objects from the world the well touches can come through the opening just as easily&mdash;it is a two-way portal.</p>

<p class="stat-block">A <i>wind fan</i> appears to be nothing more than a wood and papyrus or cloth instrument with which to create a cooling breeze. By uttering the command word, its possessor causes the fan to duplicate a <i><a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/gustOfWind.html#_gust-of-wind" >gust of wind</a></i> spell. The fan can be used once per day with no risk. If it is used more frequently, there is a 20% cumulative chance per usage during that day that the device tears into useless, nonmagical tatters.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1,500 gp; <b>Aura</b> moderate evocation; <b>CL</b> 7th; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This fragile glass flask encloses a single scrap of worn parchment held in place by a taut metal wire threaded through its cork stopper. As a full-round action, a spellcaster can cast a targeted language-dependant spell of 3rd level or lower into the flask as a full round action, which covers the parchment with magical writing and charges the flask with power. The flask cannot be used with spells that have a casting time longer than 1 full round. Any of the spell's variables that are determined by its caster (such as commands given to the spell's target) are decided when the spell is cast into the bottle. </p>
<p class="stat-block">The charged flask can be thrown as a splash weapon with a range increment of 10 feet. The flask shatters and is destroyed upon impact, releasing the stored spell. A creature struck by the flask is subject to the effects of spell contained within, just as if it had been the target of the spell. Creatures within 5 feet of the flask when it breaks hear whispery echoes of the spell's words and are also subject to its effects, though they receive a +5 bonus on their saves to resist the spell. If the spell does not ordinarily allow a save, creatures caught in the splash radius may still make a Will save to negate it (with the +5 bonus).</p>
