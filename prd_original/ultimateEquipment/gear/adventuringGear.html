<h2>Adventuring Gear</h2>
<p>The items found on the Adventuring Gear table are described in this section, along with any special benefits they confer on the user ("you").</p>
<p><i>Kits</i>: this section includes several kits of preselected gear for each character class or for specific adventuring purposes (dungeoneering, spelunking, and so on). gms can use these kits to quickly round out an npc's gear. players can use them to equip new pcs in a hurry or as a shorthand for providing gear for cohorts, followers, minions, and hirelings. the listed price for the kit includes a small discount for purchasing these items as a group. items in a kit that are used up, destroyed, or lost cost the full price to replace.</p>

<p id="air-bladder" class="stat-block-title">Air Bladder</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1 sp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Used by swimmers for longer dives, this bladder is similar to a waterskin, but is relatively airtight. If inflated, it holds enough air to sustain a Medium creature for 1 round or a Small creature for 2 rounds.</p>

<p id="alchemist's-kit" class="stat-block-title">alchemist's kit</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 40 gp; <b>Weight</b> 24 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This kit includes an alchemy crafting kit, a backpack, a bedroll, a belt pouch, a flint and steel, ink, an inkpen, an iron pot, a mess kit, soap, torches (10), trail rations (5 days), and a waterskin. The kit does not contain a formula book because an alchemist begins play with a formula book and does not need to purchase one.</p>

<p id="animal-glue" class="stat-block-title">Animal Glue </p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 5 sp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This simple glue is created by extensively boiling animal skin, bones, hooves, horn, and tendons until they turn into a ochre syrup that cools when it hardens. Before you use animal glue, you must heat it until it liquefies. You normally apply it with a brush and hold the pieces together for a minute, at which point it is cooled and hardened. The glue is sufficient to coat 1 square foot of surface, or (because of waste and spills) up to 40 smaller applications of approximately 2 square inches each. Pulling apart a large glued surface (at least 1 square foot) requires a DC 15 Strength check. Pulling apart a small glued surface (anything less than 1 square foot) requires a DC 10 Strength check.

<p class="stat-block">A buoy is used to mark a specific spot in a lake, river, or similar body of water, making it possible for you to return to that location at a later date. A common buoy includes a float (typically an air-filled bladder or sealed gourd), a 200-foot length of twine, and a 15-pound stone used as an anchor. The float is usually painted a vivid color, and may have a small flag to attract attention.

<p id="caltrops" class="stat-block-title">caltrops</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1  gp; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A caltrop is a four-pronged metal spike crafted so that one prong always faces up no matter how the caltrop comes to rest. You scatter caltrops on the ground in the hope that your enemies step on them or are at least forced to slow down to avoid them. One 2-pound bag of caltrops covers an area 5 feet square. </p>
<p class="stat-block">Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area), it runs the risk of stepping on one. Make an attack roll for the caltrops (base attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not count. If the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2 armor bonus to AC. If the attack succeeds, the creature has stepped on a caltrop. The caltrop deals 1 point of damage, and the creature's speed is reduced by half because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for 24 hours, until the creature is successfully treated with a DC 15 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/heal.html#_heal" >Heal</a> check, or until it receives at least 1 point of magical healing. A charging or running creature must immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of caltrops with no trouble. </p>
<p class="stat-block">Caltrops may not work against unusual opponents. </p>

<p id="camouflage-netting" class="stat-block-title">camouflage netting</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 20 gp; <b>Weight</b> 5 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This loose mesh of twine and varicolored cloth is used to disguise the presence of creatures or large objects. Camouflage netting must be manufactured to provide camouflage in a single type of terrain, such as snow, sand, forest, grass, swamp, urban, or water. When you hide under the netting in the appropriate terrain, you gain a +4 circumstance bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks as long as you remain immobile and prone. Covering up with camouflage netting is a full-round action requiring a DC 10 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> check (failure means you do not cover yourself correctly with the netting and do not gain its bonus on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks). You have the entangled condition when using the netting, except your Dexterity penalty does not affect your initiative or <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks. Taking off camouflage netting is a move action, or a swift action if combined with a move action to stand up from a prone position. </p>
<p class="stat-block">You may spend 1 minute covering an object with camouflage netting. Make a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> check with a &ndash;10 penalty and use the total as the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> check result for the object. Creatures who fail a <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a> check against this <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> DC do not recognize what the object is and usually treat it as a natural part of the terrain. For example, you can conceal a wagon as a rock or patch of brush. Covering a Large object requires two nets. Covering a Huge or Gargantuan object requires five nets and takes 10 minutes of work, and the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> check penalty is &ndash;20 instead of &ndash;10. Camouflaging a Colossal object depends on its shape but generally requires at least 10 camouflage nets and takes 1 hour of work, and the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> check penalty is &ndash;30 instead of &ndash;10. </p>
<p class="stat-block">A creature with the scent ability ignores the effect of camouflage netting and makes checks against your actual <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> roll when in scent range. Any creature within 10 feet of a Large or larger object hidden by camouflage netting automatically recognizes it as an object covered in camouflage.</p>

For Small creatures, the weight of a Pathfinder's kit is 7-1/2 pounds. Leaving the bedroll and rations at camp or on a mount reduces the weight by 12 pounds for Medium creatures and by 3 pounds for Small creatures.</p>

<p id="periscope" class="stat-block-title">periscope</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 20 gp; <b>Weight</b> 4 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This 2-foot-long metal tube has right angles at each end with mirrors inside; if you look in one end, you can see out the other end, allowing you safely peer over obstacles, around corners, or into small spaces your head where wouldn't fit. When using a periscope, the end of the tube counts as a Diminutive object, making it much less likely that an observed creature notices you; if you have total concealment from the creature except for the end of the periscope, use the tube's Diminutive size modifier on your <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> check instead of your own size modifier. Distortion from the mirrors gives you a &ndash;4 penalty on <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a> checks while looking through the periscope. Though the tube is fairly sturdy (hardness 5, 2 hit points), the mirrors inside are fragile (hardness 1, 1 hit point), and any damage that gets through the tube's hardness applies to the tube and the mirrors. </p>

<p id="poison-pill-ring" class="stat-block-title">Poison Pill Ring</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> +20  gp; <b>Weight</b> &mdash;</p>
<p class="stat-block">This ring has a tiny compartment under the setting, typically used to hold poison. Opening and closing a ring is a move action; doing so unseen requires a DC 20 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/sleightOfHand.html#_sleight-of-hand" >Sleight of Hand</a> check.</p>
				
<p id="poisoning-sheath" class="stat-block-title">poisoning sheath</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 50 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">This scabbard contains strips of natural sea sponges on its interior. By carefully pouring a dose of poison into the empty scabbard (a full-round action), you saturate the sponges with the toxin, which keeps it viable and wet for up to 4 hours. Preparing the scabbard carries the normal risk of poisoning yourself, just like poisoning a weapon. The next weapon you draw from the scabbard is automatically poisoned as if you had directly applied poison to it (but does not risk poisoning you); this consumes the poison in the scabbard. A scabbard only fits one type of bladed weapon, such as a dagger, shortsword, or longsword. This kind of item is usually illegal in areas that outlaw poison.</p>
				
<p id="pole" class="stat-block-title">Pole</p>

<p id="portable-bridge" class="stat-block-title">portable bridge</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 200 gp; <b>Weight</b> 60 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">When staked down with eight pitons (four on each side of the gap), this rope and slat bridge can support up to 1,500 pounds and span a 30-foot gap. It rolls up into a parcel that can be carried slung over the back or by a pack animal. Convincing an animal to cross a portable bridge requires the come or heel trick.</p>
				
<p id="portable-ram" class="stat-block-title">Portable Ram</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 10  gp; <b>Weight</b> 20 lbs.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This 8-inch-diameter iron pot is sturdy and has feet, a lid, and a rounded handle. It can hold enough stew to feed one hungry human for one meal. A mithral pot is lighter and food rarely sticks to it.</p>
				
<p id="powder" class="stat-block-title">Powder</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1 CP; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Powdered chalk, flour, and similar materials are popular with adventurers for their utility in pinpointing invisible creatures. Throwing a bag of powder into a square is an attack against AC 5, and momentarily reveals whether an invisible creature is there. A much more effective method is to spread powder on a surface (which takes 1 full round) and look for footprints.</p>
				
<p id="powder-horn" class="stat-block-title">Powder horn</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 3 gp; <b>Weight</b> 1 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Typically crafted from hollowed-out animal horn, but increasingly crafted from metal in a wide variety of shapes, a powder horn can hold up to 10 doses of black powder. A powder horn protects black powder stored within in it from exposure to fire, electricity, firearm misfires, and water, and the narrow end of the horn is useful in funneling the expensive powder carefully into the barrel of a firearm.</p>

<p class="stat-block">People who lose hands, arms, legs, or feet in combat sometimes replace them with prosthetics: realistic simulations of their missing limbs. Usually carved of wood and painted to match the wearer's skin tone, these items have limited functionality, allowing a legless person to walk at half speed, or enabling an armless person to hold a shield in a fixed position, but little more. Clever individuals have been known to create small compartments in their prosthetics, just large enough to hold very small objects. A prosthetic hand or foot can hold an item with negligible weight, while a prosthetic limb can hold up to 1 or 2 pounds.</p>

<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 4 CP; <b>Weight</b> 2 lbs.</p>
<p class="stat-block">Saws can take many different shapes, from small carpentry saws to the long, two-handled saws used by lumberjacks. You can insert a saw between a door and its frame to cut through wooden bolts or bars, dealing 5 hit points per round plus your Strength modifier to the sawed object as a full-round action. Hearing the sawing requires a successful DC 10 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a> check. Saws used to cut ice on rivers have a point on the end to break through the ice before cutting.</p>

<p id="scroll-case" class="stat-block-title">Scroll Case</p>
<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Price</b> 1  gp; <b>Weight</b> 1/2 lb.</p>
<p class="stat-block">A leather or wooden scroll case easily holds four scrolls; you can cram more inside, but retrieving any of them becomes a full-round action rather than a move action. You must destroy the scroll case to damage its contents (hardness 2 for leather or 5 for wood, 2 hit points, break DC 15). A scroll case is not watertight, and must still be protected from the elements.</p>

<p class="stat-block">This item consists of a pair of wooden poles with a footrest halfway up. By standing on the footrests and holding the tops of the poles you can avoid certain ground-based threats to your feet. For example, you can use stilts to cross water without getting wet, but you would still activate a trap that triggers when you walk in a certain area. Using stilts reduces your base speed from 30 feet to 20 feet, or from 20 feet to 15 feet. You can hop off your stilts as a move action, or as a free action with a successful DC 10 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check. </p>
<p class="stat-block">You must use both your hands to walk with stilts. Walking with stilts requires a DC 5 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check for each move. Failing this check means you do not move for that move action; failing by 5 or more means you fall off the stilts. If you want to use one hand for something else while standing on stilts, you must succeed at a DC 10 <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> check or lose the action; if you want to use two hands, the DC increases to 20. </p>
<p class="stat-block">Stilts for a Medium creature raise you 2 feet above the ground; stilts for a Small creature raise you 1 foot from the ground. You can use taller stilts, but each additional foot of elevation increases the <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a> DCs of using stilts by +5. A stilt has hardness 5 and 10 hit points. If you only have one stilt, your speed drops to 5 feet because you can only hop rather than walk. </p>
<p class="stat-block"><i>Masterwork Stilts</i>: These stilts strap to your feet and legs, allowing you to use your hands for other tasks without penalty.

However, you cannot switch to a different weapon without first untying the cord (a full-round action) or cutting it (a move action or an attack, hardness 0, 0 hit points).
