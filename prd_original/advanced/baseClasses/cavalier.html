				<p>While many warriors strive to perfect their art, spending all of their time honing their skill at martial arms, others spend as much effort dedicating themselves to a cause. These warriors, known as cavaliers, swear themselves to a purpose, serving it above all else. Cavaliers are skilled at fighting from horseback, and are often found charging across a battlefield, with the symbol of their order trailing on a long, fluttering banner. The cavalier's true power comes from the conviction of his ideals, the oaths that he swears, and the challenges he makes. </p>
				<p id="role"><b>Role</b>: Cavaliers tend to marshal forces on the battlefield, using their mounted talents and challenges to control the flow of the fight. Outside of battle, cavaliers can be found advancing their cause through diplomacy and, if needed, subterfuge. The cavalier is no stranger to courtly intrigue and can hold his own in even the most delicate of social situations.</p>

</div>
				<h1 id="class-features">Class Features</h1>
				<p>The following are the class features of the cavalier.</p>
				<p id="weapon-and-armor-proficiency"><b>Weapon and Armor Proficiency</b>: Cavaliers are proficient with all simple and martial weapons, with all types of armor (heavy, light, and medium) and with shields (except tower shields).</p>
				<p id="challenge"><b>Challenge (Ex)</b>: Once per day, a cavalier can challenge a foe to combat. As a swift action, the cavalier chooses one target within sight to challenge. The cavalier's melee attacks deal extra damage whenever the attacks are made against the target of his challenge. This extra damage is equal to the cavalier's level. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day for every three levels beyond 1st, to a maximum of seven times per day at 19th level. </p>
				<p>Challenging a foe requires much of the cavalier's concentration. The cavalier takes a &ndash;2 penalty to his Armor Class, except against attacks made by the target of his challenge.</p>
				<p>The challenge remains in effect until the target is dead or unconscious or until the combat ends. Each cavalier's challenge also includes another effect which is listed in the section describing the cavalier's order.</p>
				<p id="mount"><b>Mount (Ex)</b>: A cavalier gains the service of a loyal and trusty steed to carry him into battle. This mount functions as a druid's animal companion, using the cavalier's level as his effective druid level. The creature must be one that he is capable of riding and is suitable as a mount. A Medium cavalier can select a camel or a horse. A Small cavalier can select a pony or wolf, but can also select a boar or a dog if he is at least 4th level. The GM might approve other animals as suitable mounts. </p>
				<p>A cavalier does not take an armor check penalty on <a href="../../skills/ride.html#_ride" >Ride</a> checks while riding his mount. The mount is always considered combat trained and begins play with Light Armor Proficiency as a bonus feat. A cavalier's mount does not gain the share spells special ability.</p>
				<p>A cavalier's bond with his mount is strong, with the pair learning to anticipate each other's moods and moves. Should a cavalier's mount die, the cavalier may find another mount to serve him after 1 week of mourning. This new mount does not gain the link, evasion, devotion, or improved evasion special abilities until the next time the cavalier gains a level. </p>
				<p id="order"><b>Order (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a cavalier must pledge himself to a specific order. The order grants the cavalier a number of bonuses, class skills, and special abilities. In addition, each order includes a number of edicts that the cavalier must follow. If he violates any of these edicts, he loses the benefits from his order's challenge ability for 24 hours. The violation of an edict is subject to GM interpretation.</p>
				<p>A cavalier cannot change his order without undertaking a lengthy process to dedicate himself to a new cause. When this choice is made, he immediately loses all of the benefits from his old order. He must then follow the edicts of his new order for one entire level without gaining any benefits from that order. Once accomplished, he gains all of the bonuses from his new order. Note that the names of these orders might vary depending upon the campaign setting or GM's preference.</p>
				<p id="tactician"><b>Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 1st level, a cavalier receives a teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. As a standard action, the cavalier can grant this feat to all allies within 30 feet who can see and hear him. Allies retain the use of this bonus feat for 3 rounds plus 1 round for every two levels the cavalier possesses. Allies do not need to meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats. The cavalier can use this ability once per day at 1st level, plus one additional time per day at 5th level and for every 5 levels thereafter.</p>
				<p id="cavalier's-charge"><b>Cavalier's Charge (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, a cavalier learns to make more accurate charge attacks while mounted. The cavalier receives a +4 bonus on melee attack rolls on a charge while mounted (instead of the normal +2). In addition, the cavalier does not suffer any penalty to his AC after making a charge attack while mounted. </p>
				<p id="expert-trainer"><b>Expert Trainer (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a cavalier learns to train mounts with speed and unsurpassed expertise. The cavalier receives a bonus equal to 1/2 his cavalier level whenever he uses <a href="../../skills/handleAnimal.html#_handle-animal" >Handle Animal</a> on an animal that serves as a mount. In addition, he can reduce the time needed to teach a mount a new trick or train a mount for a general purpose to 1 day per 1 week required by increasing the DC by +5. He can also train more than one mount at once, although each mount after the first adds +2 to the DC.</p>
				<p id="banner"><b>Banner (Ex)</b>: At 5th level, a cavalier's banner becomes a symbol of inspiration to his allies and companions. As long as the cavalier's banner is clearly visible, all allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against fear and a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls made as part of a charge. At 10th level, and every five levels thereafter, these bonuses increase by +1. The banner must be at least Small or larger and must be carried or displayed by the cavalier or his mount to function. </p>
				<p id="bonus-feat"><b>Bonus Feat</b>: At 6th level, and at every six levels thereafter, a cavalier gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement. These bonus feats must be selected from those listed as combat feats. The cavalier must meet the prerequisites of these bonus feats.</p>
				<p id="greater-tactician"><b>Greater Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Using the tactician ability is a swift action.</p>
				<p id="mighty-charge"><b>Mighty Charge (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a cavalier learns to make devastating charge attacks while mounted. Double the threat range of any weapons wielded during a charge while mounted. This increase does not stack with other effects that increase the threat range of the weapon. In addition, the cavalier can make a free bull rush, disarm, sunder, or trip combat maneuver if his charge attack is successful. This free combat maneuver does not provoke an attack of opportunity.</p>
				<p id="demanding-challenge"><b>Demanding Challenge (Ex)</b>: At 12th level, whenever a cavalier declares a challenge, his target must pay attention to the threat he poses. As long as the target is within the threatened area of the cavalier, it takes a &ndash;2 penalty to its AC from attacks made by anyone other than the cavalier.</p>
				<p id="greater-banner"><b>Greater Banner (Ex)</b>: At 14th level, the cavalier's banner becomes a rallying call to his allies. All allies within 60 feet receive a +2 morale bonus on saving throws against charm and compulsion spells and effects. In addition, while his banner is displayed, the cavalier can spend a standard action to wave the banner through the air, granting all allies within 60 feet an additional saving throw against any one spell or effect that is targeting them. This save is made at the original DC. Spells and effects that do not allow saving throws are unaffected by this ability. An ally cannot benefit from this ability more than once per day. </p>
				<p id="master-tactician"><b>Master Tactician (Ex)</b>: At 17th level, the cavalier receives an additional teamwork feat as a bonus feat. He must meet the prerequisites for this feat. The cavalier can grant this feat to his allies using the tactician ability. Whenever the cavalier uses the tactician ability, he grants any two teamwork feats that he knows. He can select from any of his teamwork feats, not just his bonus feats.</p>
				<p id="supreme-charge"><b>Supreme Charge (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, whenever the cavalier makes a charge attack while mounted, he deals double the normal amount of damage (or triple if using a lance). In addition, if the cavalier confirms a critical hit on a charge attack while mounted, the target is stunned for 1d4 rounds. A Will save reduces this to staggered for 1d4 rounds. The DC is equal to 10 + the cavalier's base attack bonus. </p>
				<h1 id="cavalier-orders">Cavalier Orders</h1>
				<p>The following orders represent the most common chosen by cavaliers. Members of these orders are not necessarily bound together, but some organizations do exist that are comprised of cavaliers that all belong to one specific order.</p>

An order of the star cavalier can make <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) skill checks untrained. If he has ranks in the skill, he receives a bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1) as long as the check involves his chosen faith.</p>
				<p id="order-abilities"><b>Order Abilities</b>: An order of the star cavalier gains the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
				<p id="calling"><i>Calling (Ex)</i>: At 2nd level, the cavalier can make a short prayer as a standard action, filling him with confidence in his abilities. At any point in the next minute, he can receive a competence bonus on an ability check, attack roll, saving throw, or skill check equal to his Charisma modifier. He must declare that he is using this bonus before the roll is made. He can use this ability up to four times per day, once for each type of check or roll. In addition, the cavalier adds 1/2 his cavalier level to any levels of paladin or cleric he might possess for the purposes of determining the effects of channel energy or lay on hands.</p>
				<p id="for-the-faith"><i>For the Faith (Ex)</i>: At 8th level, the cavalier can call upon his faith to bolster himself in combat. As a free action, the cavalier can call out the name of his deity, granting him a morale bonus on attack rolls equal to his Charisma modifier for 1 round. In addition, any allies within 30 feet that share his faith also receive half this bonus (minimum +1). The cavalier can use this ability once per day, plus one additional time per day at 12th level and every four levels thereafter.</p>
				<p id="retribution"><i>Retribution (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, the cavalier can take retribution on those who dare to strike an agent of his faith. Whenever an enemy makes a successful melee attack against the cavalier or an adjacent ally devoted to the same faith as the cavalier, the enemy provokes an attack of opportunity from the cavalier. The cavalier receives a +2 morale bonus on the attack of opportunity. If the attack made by the enemy was a critical hit, the cavalier may treat the enemy as the target of his challenge for the attack of opportunity. The cavalier can use this ability once per round.</p>
				<h2 id="order-of-the-sword">Order of the Sword</h2>
				<p>Cavaliers who join the order of the sword dedicate their lives to the code of chivalry, living a life of honor, valor, and fairness. Cavaliers of this order tend to swear service to a lord or a lady. Of all the orders, the order of the sword is perhaps the broadest in terms of its focus and ideals.</p>
				<p id="edicts"><b>Edicts</b>: The cavalier must show courage in the face of danger, mercy to those who have wronged him, and charity to the poor and the meek. He must be just and honorable at all times and in all things. He must defend his honor and, above all else, the honor of those he serves.</p>
				<p id="challenge"><b>Challenge</b>: Whenever an order of the sword cavalier issues a challenge, he receives a +1 morale bonus on attack rolls against the target of his challenge so long as he is astride his mount. The bonus increases by +1 for every four levels the cavalier possesses.</p>
				<p id="skills"><b>Skills</b>: An order of the sword cavalier adds <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (nobility) (Int) and <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (religion) (Int) to his list of class skills. Whenever the cavalier uses <a href="../../skills/senseMotive.html#_sense-motive" >Sense Motive</a> to oppose a <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff" >Bluff</a> check, he receives a competence bonus on the check equal to 1/2 his cavalier level (minimum +1).</p>
				<p id="order-abilities"><b>Order Abilities</b>: An order of the sword cavalier receives the following abilities as he increases in level.</p>
				<p id="by-my-honor"><i>By My Honor (Ex)</i>: At 2nd level, the cavalier must select one alignment. As long as he maintains the selected alignment, he receives a +2 morale bonus to one saving throw of his choice.</p>
				<p id="mounted-mastery"><i>Mounted Mastery (Ex)</i>: At 8th level, the cavalier ignores the armor check penalty when using the <a href="../../skills/ride.html#_ride" >Ride</a> skill, regardless of whether or not the creature he is riding is his mount. Whenever he makes a charge attack while mounted, he receives a +4 dodge bonus to his AC to avoid attacks set against his charge. When making such an attack, he can add his mount's Strength modifier to the damage roll, in addition to his own. He also receives a bonus feat, chosen from the following list: <a href="../../feats.html#_mounted-combat" >Mounted Combat</a>, <a href="../../feats.html#_ride-by-attack" >Ride-By Attack</a>, <a href="../../feats.html#_skill-focus" >Skill Focus</a> (<a href="../../skills/ride.html#_ride" >Ride</a>), <a href="../../feats.html#_spirited-charge" >Spirited Charge</a>, <a href="../../feats.html#_trample" >Trample</a>, or <a href="../../feats.html#_unseat" >Unseat</a>. He must qualify for the feat selected.</p>
				<p id="knight's-challenge"><i>Knight's Challenge (Ex)</i>: At 15th level, the cavalier can make a knight's challenge once per day. This functions like a normal challenge, but the cavalier adds his Charisma bonus on all attack rolls and damage rolls made against the target of his challenge. In addition, he receives a +4 circumstance bonus on attack rolls made to confirm critical hits against the target of his knight's challenge.</p>
