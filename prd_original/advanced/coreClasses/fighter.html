				<h1 id="fighter" class="monster-header">Fighter</h1>
				<p>From dockside brawlers to legendary champions, poor foot soldiers to the greatest duelists of the nobility, fighters are those who devote themselves wholeheartedly to the art of combat. While barbarians tap into raw fury in battle, fighters know that the mind is the keenest weapon, and they use theirs to great effect, mastering numerous armaments and fighting styles in a never-ending quest to be the last warrior standing. </p>
				<p>Presented below are a number of common martial themes, complete with variant class abilities to help customize characters to their chosen fighting style.</p>
				<h1 id="archer">Archer</h1>
				<p>The archer is dedicated to the careful mastery of the bow, perfecting his skills with years of practice honed day after day on ranges and hunting for game, or else on the battlefield, raining destruction down on the enemy lines.</p>
				<p id="hawkeye"><b>Hawkeye (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an archer gains a +1 bonus on <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a> checks, and the range increment for any bow he uses increases by 5 feet. These bonuses increase by +1 and 5 additional feet for every 4 levels beyond 2nd. This ability replaces bravery.</p>
				<p id="trick-shot"><b>Trick Shot (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an archer can choose one of the following combat maneuvers or actions: disarm, feint, or sunder. He can perform this action with a bow against any target within 30 feet, with a &ndash;4 penalty to his CMB. Every four levels beyond 3rd, he may choose an additional trick shot to learn. These maneuvers use up arrows as normal.</p>
				<p>At 11th level, he may also choose from the following combat maneuvers: bull rush, grapple, trip. A target grappled by an arrow can break free by destroying the archer's arrow (hardness 5, hit points 1, break DC 13) or with an <a href="../../skills/escapeArtist.html#_escape-artist" >Escape Artist</a> or CMB check (against the archer's CMD &ndash;4).

This ability replaces weapon training 4.</p>
				<p id="ranged-defense"><b>Ranged Defense (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, an archer gains DR 5/&mdash; against ranged attacks. In addition, as an immediate action, he can catch an arrow fired at him and shoot it any target he chooses, as if he had the <a href="../../feats.html#_snatch-arrows" >Snatch Arrows</a> feat. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
				<p id="weapon-mastery"><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: An archer must choose a type of bow. </p>
				<h1 id="crossbowman">Crossbowman</h1>

				<p id="penetrating-shot"><b>Penetrating Shot (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, when a crossbowman confirms a critical hit with a crossbow, the bolt pierces the target and can strike another creature in line behind it.

If this attack is also a critical hit, the bolt can continue to hit another target, but the penalties stack. This ability replaces armor mastery.</p>
				<p id="weapon-mastery"><b>Weapon Mastery (Ex)</b>: A crossbowman must choose a type of crossbow. </p>
				<h1 id="free-hand-fighter">Free Hand Fighter</h1>
				<p>The free hand fighter specializes in the delicate art of handling a single weapon in one hand while using his free hand to balance, block, tip, and distract his opponents. While not a brawler, his open hand is as much a weapon as a bow or blade. His fighting school benefits only apply when he is using a one-handed weapon and carrying nothing in his other hand.</p>
				<p id="deceptive-strike"><b>Deceptive Strike (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a free hand fighter gains a +1 bonus to CMB and CMD on disarm checks and on <a href="../../skills/bluff.html#_bluff" >Bluff</a> checks to feint or create a diversion to hide.

				<p id="timely-tip"><b>Timely Tip (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push aside the target's shield. If successful, the target loses its shield bonus to AC against the free hand fighter's next attack. This ability replaces weapon training 2.</p>
				<p id="interference"><b>Interference (Ex)</b>: At 13th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm or trip combat maneuver against a target he threatens as a move action to push his opponent off balance. If successful, the target becomes flat-footed. This condition lasts until the target takes damage from a melee or ranged attack or until the beginning of the free hand fighter's next turn, whichever comes first. This ability replaces weapon training 3.</p>
				<p id="reversal"><b>Reversal (Ex)</b>: At 19th level, a free hand fighter can make a disarm combat maneuver against a creature he threatens as an immediate action when he is the target of a melee attack from another creature. If successful, the attack changes to target the target of the free hand fighter's maneuver instead of the free hand fighter himself. This ability replaces armor mastery. </p>
				<h1 id="mobile-fighter">Mobile Fighter</h1>
				<p>Where some fighters focus on strength and raw power, the mobile fighter relies on swiftness and mobility, gliding across the battlefield like a steel whirlwind and leaving destruction in his wake. </p>

				<p id="rapid-attack"><b>Rapid Attack (Ex)</b>: At 11th level, a mobile fighter can combine a full attack action with a single move.

This ability replaces armor training 3.</p>
				<p id="fleet-footed"><b><a href="../../feats.html#_fleet" >Fleet</a> Footed (Ex)</b>: At 15th level, the mobile fighter's speed increases by 10 feet.

				<h1 id="phalanx-soldier">Phalanx Soldier</h1>

				<p>At 13th level, he can instead provide cover (+4 cover bonus to AC, +2 bonus on Reflex saves) and evasion (as a rogue) to one adjacent ally until the beginning of his next turn. This cover does not allow <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks. </p>

				<p id="shielded-fortress"><b>Shielded Fortress (Ex)</b>: At 20th level, a phalanx fighter's shield cannot be disarmed or sundered. He gains evasion (as a rogue) when using a shield (improved evasion when using a tower shield). As a move action, a phalanx fighter can provide evasion to all adjacent allies until the beginning of his next turn. As an immediate action, he can provide improved evasion to an adjacent ally against one attack. This ability replaces weapon mastery.</p>
				<h1 id="polearm-master">Polearm Master</h1>
				<p>The polearm master is schooled in the ancient wisdom that enemies are best faced at the end of long striking pole, lashing like a serpent before clumsy swords and axes can even be brought to bear.</p>
				<p id="pole-fighting"><b>Pole Fighting (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, as an immediate action, a polearm master can shorten the grip on his spear or polearm with reach and use it against adjacent targets.
