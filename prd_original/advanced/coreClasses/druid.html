				<h1 id="druid" class="monster-header">Druid</h1>
				<p>Druids are the keepers of the wildlands, the guardians watching at nature's border to ensure that hubristic civilization does not overreach its bounds. From the highest mountain peaks to the steaming jungles and seas, druids learn and draw their power from their surrounding environment and the creatures that live there. Like nature itself, druids can be gentle and succoring or red in tooth and claw, and need answer only to the wind and the rain.</p>
				<p>Presented below are new variant class rules to help you customize your druid for specific terrain types, as well as rules for druidic shamans who worship specific totem animals.</p>
				<h1 id="aquatic-druid">Aquatic Druid</h1>
				<p>Shepherds of the lakes and seas, aquatic druids guard ecosystems ranging from shallows streams to deep ocean trenches, ministering to their residents and communing with the tides.</p>
				<p id="wild-empathy"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: An aquatic druid's wild empathy functions only on creatures that have a swim speed or the aquatic or water subtype; however, she can improve the attitude of any such creature with Intelligence 2 or less regardless of type, including mindless creatures.</p>

This ability replaces woodland stride. </p>
				<p id="natural-swimmer"><b>Natural Swimmer (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an aquatic druid gains a swim speed equal to half her land speed. This ability replaces trackless step.</p>
				<p id="resist-ocean's-fury"><b>Resist Ocean's Fury (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, an aquatic druid gains a +4 bonus on saving throws against spells of the water type or the exceptional or supernatural abilities of creatures with the aquatic or water subtype. This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: An aquatic druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2.</p>
				<p id="seaborn"><b>Seaborn (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, an aquatic druid gains the aquatic subtype, the amphibious trait, and a swim speed equal to her land speed. She also can endure cold climate effects as if using <i><a href="../../spells/endureElements.html#_endure-elements" >endure elements</a></i>. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>
				<p id="deep-diver"><b>Deep Diver (Ex)</b>: At 13th level, an aquatic druid gains DR/slashing or piercing equal to 1/2 her level. This damage reduction also applies against spells and spell-like abilities that inflict damage by grappling or crushing (e.g., <i><a href="../../spells/blackTentacles.html#_black-tentacles" >black tentacles</a></i>, <i><a href="../../spells/crushingHand.html#_crushing-hand" >crushing hand</a></i>). She never takes pressure damage from deep water. This ability replaces a thousand faces. </p>
				<h1 id="arctic-druid">Arctic Druid</h1>
				<p>An arctic druid watches over the stark landscape of the far frozen reaches of the world, tending the stunted and rugged life that ekes out its survival in the least habitable climes.</p>
				<p id="arctic-native"><b>Arctic Native (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, an arctic druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography), <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a>, <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a>, and <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in cold or icy terrain, and she cannot be tracked in cold or icy terrain. This ability replaces woodland stride. </p>
				<p id="icewalking"><b>Icewalking (Ex)</b>: At 3rd level, an arctic druid suffers no penalty to speed or on <a href="../../skills/acrobatics.html#_acrobatics" >Acrobatics</a>, <a href="../../skills/climb.html#_climb" >Climb</a>, or <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a> checks in snowy or icy terrain or weather conditions and can walk across snow crusts or thin ice without breaking through.

This ability replaces a thousand faces. </p>
				<h1 id="blight-druid">Blight Druid</h1>
				<p>The devoted servants of nature corrupted, ruined, and destroyed, blight druids are the caretakers of lands ravaged by natural disaster. While some are devoted to reforming and reclaiming lands despoiled by the ravages of civilization, others seek out the more rapacious violence inherent in nature and feed the creeping rot and decay that brings an end to all things.</p>
				<p id="nature-bond"><b>Nature Bond (Ex)</b>: A blight druid may not bond with an animal companion, but may either call a familiar as a wizard of her druid level or select from the Darkness, Death, and Destruction domains in addition to those normally available. </p>
				<p id="vermin-empathy"><b>Vermin Empathy (Su)</b>: A blight druid can improve the attitude of vermin as a normal druid can with animals. Vermin have a starting attitude of unfriendly.

				<p id="miasma"><b>Miasma (Ex)</b>: Starting at 5th level, if a blight druid is adjacent to a creature at the beginning of its turn, the creature must succeed at a Fortitude save with a DC of 10 + 1/2 the druid's level + the druid's Wisdom modifier or become sickened for 1 round. A creature of the animal, fey, or plant type that fails its save is nauseated for 1 round and sickened for 1 minute thereafter. If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours, as are creatures immune to disease. This ability replaces trackless step and resist nature's lure.</p>
				<p id="blightblooded"><b>Blightblooded (Ex)</b>: At 9th level, a blight druid gains immunity to all diseases, including natural and supernatural diseases. She also becomes immune to effects that would cause her to become sickened or nauseated. This ability replaces venom immunity.</p>

If the creature makes its save, it is immune to this effect for 24 hours. This ability replaces a thousand faces.</p>
				<h1 id="cave-druid">Cave Druid</h1>
				<p>Far from the green fields of the world above lies a lightless expanse beneath the surface. This darkling fairyland is not without beauty and natural wonders of its own, and a few druids seek to preserve this hidden realm and purge it of the fell horrors that creep up from below. </p>
				<p id="cavesense"><b>Cavesense (Ex)</b>: A underground druid adds <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) rather than <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography) as a class skill and gains a +2 bonus on <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (dungeoneering) and <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> skill checks. This ability replaces the nature sense ability. </p>

				<p id="wild-empathy"><b>Wild Empathy (Ex)</b>: A cave druid can influence oozes, rather than magical beasts, with a &ndash;4 penalty on her wild empathy check. </p>
				<p id="tunnelrunner"><b>Tunnelrunner (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a cave druid can move through areas of rubble or narrow passages that require squeezing at her normal movement rate and without penalty. This ability replaces woodland stride. </p>

				<p id="resist-subterranean-corruption"><b>Resist Subterranean Corruption (Ex)</b>: At 4th level, a cave druid gains a +2 bonus on saves against exceptional, supernatural, and spell-like abilities of oozes and aberrations. This ability replaces resist nature's lure. </p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: A cave druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for this ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2. She cannot use wild shape to adopt a plant form. At 10th level, the cave druid can assume the form of a Small or Medium ooze as if using <i><a href="../../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-iii" >beast shape III</a></i>, and at 12th level that of a Tiny or Large ooze as if using <i><a href="../../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-iv" >beast shape IV</a> </i>(treating the ooze as if it were a magical beast without a natural armor bonus). When in ooze form, the cave druid has no discernible anatomy and is immune to poison, sneak attacks, and critical hits.</p>
				<h1 id="desert-druid">Desert Druid</h1>
				<p>Not all climates are verdant paradises, but even in the sere deserts there is life&mdash;though often hidden from the sun and rarely friendly&mdash;and raw, desolate beauty. Here desert druids come to pay homage, protect and maintain the few habitable locales, and witness nature's majesty in all its burning, merciless glory. </p>
				<p id="desert-native"><b>Desert Native (Ex)</b>: At 2nd level, a desert druid gains a bonus on Initiative checks and <a href="../../skills/knowledge.html#_knowledge" >Knowledge</a> (geography), <a href="../../skills/perception.html#_perception" >Perception</a>, <a href="../../skills/stealth.html#_stealth" >Stealth</a>, and <a href="../../skills/survival.html#_survival" >Survival</a> checks equal to 1/2 her druid level in desert terrain, and she cannot be tracked in such environments.

This ability replaces resist nature's lure.</p>
				<p id="wild-shape"><b>Wild Shape (Su)</b>: A desert druid gains this ability at 6th level, except that her effective druid level for the ability is equal to her druid level &ndash; 2.

At 10th level she can assume the form of a Small or Medium vermin, at 12th level a Tiny or Large vermin, and at 14th level a Diminutive or Huge vermin. This effect functions as <i><a href="../../spells/beastShape.html#_beast-shape-iv" >beast shape IV</a></i> (treating the vermin as an animal to determine its ability and natural armor modifiers).</p>

This ability replaces a thousand faces. </p>
				<h1 id="jungle-druid">Jungle Druid</h1>
