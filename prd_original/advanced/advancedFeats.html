        <div><h1 id="feats" class="monster-header">Feats</h1>
				<p>Feats represent a special trick or ability a character has acquired through training, luck, or as a quirk of his or her birth. They grant characters abilities others lack, giving them an edge in the right situation. While some specifically interact with a PC's race or class, most can be taken by anyone who meets the prerequisites. The feats in this book expand upon those in the <i>Pathfinder Roleplaying Game Core Rulebook, </i>including a host of new combat feats and metamagic feats. In addition, this chapter also introduces teamwork feats, which function only when two characters with the same feat work together.</p>
				<h1 id="types-of-feats">Types of Feats</h1>
				<p>While most of the feats presented here are general, and have no special rules governing them, some feats have a category associated with them that involves special rules. This category is listed after the feat name. The following types of feats can be found in this chapter.</p>
				<h2 id="combat-feats">Combat Feats</h2>
				<p>Any feat designated as a combat feat can be selected as a fighter's bonus feat. This designation does not restrict characters of other classes from selecting these feats, assuming they meet the prerequisites.</p>
				<h2 id="metamagic-feats"><a href="#table-metamagic-feats">Metamagic Feats</a></h2>
				<p>Metamagic feats allow spellcasters to modify and change their spells, granting them new powers and effects. Such spells generally take up a higher-level spell slot than the normal spell.</p>
				<h2 id="teamwork-feats"><a href="#table-teamwork-feats">Teamwork Feats</a></h2>
				<p>Teamwork feats grant large bonuses, but they only function under specific circumstances. In most cases, these feats require an ally who also possesses the feat to be positioned carefully on the battlefield. Teamwork feats provide no bonus if the listed conditions are not met. Note that allies who are paralyzed, stunned, unconscious, or otherwise unable to act do not count for the purposes of these feats.</p>
				
				<h1 id="feat-descriptions">Feat Descriptions</h1>
				<p>Feats are summarized on the table below. Note that the prerequisites and benefits of the feats listed in this table are abbreviated for ease of reference. See the feats' description for full details.</p>
				<p>The following format is used for all feat descriptions.</p>
				<p id="feat-name"><b>Feat Name</b>: The feat's name also indicates what subcategory, if any, the feat belongs to, and is followed by a basic description of what the feat does.</p>
				<p><b>Prerequisite</b>: A minimum ability score, another feat or feats, a minimum base attack bonus, a minimum number of ranks in one or more skills, or anything else required in order to take the feat. This entry is absent if a feat has no prerequisites. A feat may have more than one prerequisite.</p>
				<p><b>Benefit</b>: What a feat enables the character (“you” in the feat description) to do. If a character has the same feat more than once, its benefits do not stack unless indicated otherwise in the description.</p>
				<p id="normal"><b>Normal</b>: What a character who does not have this feat is limited to or restricted from doing. If not having the feat causes no particular drawback, this entry is absent.</p>
				<p><b>Special</b>: Additional unusual facts about the feat.</p>

If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the daze effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Will save to negate the daze effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become dazed, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell. A dazing spell uses up a spell slot three levels higher than the spell's actual level. Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.</p>

Those already in the area suffer no additional harm, but other creatures or objects entering the area are subject to its effects. A lingering spell with a visual manifestation obscures vision, providing concealment (20% miss chance) beyond 5 feet and total concealment (50% miss chance) beyond 20 feet.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-2">A lingering spell uses up a spell slot one level higher than the spell's actual level.</p>

When making poisons, you can create a number of doses equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum 1) at one time. These additional doses do not increase the time required, but they do increase the raw material cost.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-2">In addition, whenever you make alchemical items or poisons using <a href="../skills/craft.html#_craft" >Craft</a> (alchemy), use the item's gp value as its sp value when determining your progress (do not multiply the item's gp cost by 10 to determine its sp cost).</p>

				<p>You look for every edge when flanking an enemy.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Base attack bonus +4.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> Whenever you and an ally who also has this feat are flanking the same creature, your flanking bonus on attack rolls increases to +4.

				<h2 id="paired-opportunists">Paired Opportunists (Combat, Teamwork)</h2>
				<p>You know how to make an enemy pay for lax defenses.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 circumstance bonus on attacks of opportunity against creatures that you both threaten.

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisite:</b> Half-elf, half-orc, or halfling (see Special).</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> You receive a +10 bonus on <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise" >Disguise</a> checks to disguise yourself as a human, and do not receive the penalty for disguising yourself as a member of another race when you do so. In areas largely populated or settled by humans, you can take 10 on your <a href="../skills/disguise.html#_disguise" >Disguise</a> check, meaning most people tend to assume you are human unless given a reason to think otherwise.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Special:</b> A halfling may take this feat, but must have the <a href="#childlike" >Childlike</a> feat as a prerequisite. The benefits of the two feats stack.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Dex 13, Wis 13, <a href="../feats.html#_improved-unarmed-strike" >Improved Unarmed Strike</a>, base attack bonus +8.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> You must declare that you are using this feat before you make your attack roll (thus a failed attack roll ruins the attempt). You must use one of the following weapons to make the attack: kama, nunchaku, quarterstaff, sai, and siangham. You can roll your attack roll twice and take the higher result. If one of these rolls is a critical threat, the other roll is used as your confirmation roll (your choice if they are both critical threats). You may attempt a perfect attack once per day for every four levels you have attained (but see Special), and no more than once per round.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> Whenever a creature targeted by a persistent spell or within its area succeeds on its saving throw against the spell, it must make another saving throw against the effect. If a creature fails this second saving throw, it suffers the full effects of the spell, as if it had failed its first saving throw. A persistent spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-2">Spells that do not require a saving throw to resist or lessen the spell's effect do not benefit from this feat.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Normal:</b> Using a ranged weapon while you are threatened provokes attacks of opportunity.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> Choose one spell which you have the ability to cast. You can cast that spell spontaneously by sacrificing a prepared spell or spell slot of equal or higher level. You can apply any metamagic feats you possess to this spell when you cast it. This increases the minimum level of the prepared spell or spell slot you must sacrifice in order to cast it but does not affect the casting time.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Special:</b> You can gain this feat multiple times. Its effects do not stack. Each time you take the feat, it applies to a different spell.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Prerequisites:</b> Str 15, <a href="../feats.html#_power-attack" >Power Attack</a>, base attack bonus +1.</p>

				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> Whenever you are adjacent to an ally who also has this feat, you receive a +4 competence bonus on concentration checks. If your ally is wielding a buckler or a light shield, this bonus increases by +1. If your ally is wielding a heavy shield or a tower shield, this bonus increases by +2. Finally, if an enemy threatening you and your ally has the <a href="../feats.html#_disruptive" >Disruptive</a> feat, or another ability that increases the DC of concentration checks, the amount of the increase is halved.</p>

				<p>You can sicken creatures with your spells.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Benefit:</b> You can modify a spell to sicken a creature damaged by the spell. When a creature takes damage from this spell, they become sickened for a number of rounds equal to the original level of the spell. If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the sickening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the sickening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become sickened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added on to the duration of the spell. A sickening spell uses up a spell slot two levels higher than the spell's actual level.</p>
                <p class="stat-block-2">Spells that do not inflict damage do not benefit from this feat.</p>

If the attack hits&mdash;whether or not it does damage&mdash;your target is pushed back 5 feet away from you. You can then fire arrows from your bow normally, at the original target, or at another target within range. This melee attack replaces the extra attack from <a href="../feats.html#_rapid-shot" >Rapid Shot</a>, and all of your attack rolls for the round (the melee attack and the ranged attacks) take a &ndash;2 penalty.

This attack counts as one of your attacks of opportunity for the round. Using this feat does not count toward the number of actions you can usually take each round.</p>
				<p class="stat-block-1"><b>Normal:</b> You can usually only take one standard action and one 5-foot step each round.</p>
				<h2 id="stone-faced">Stone-Faced</h2>

If the spell allows a saving throw, a successful save negates the deafening effect. If the spell does not allow a save, the target can make a Fortitude save to negate the deafening effect. If the spell effect also causes the creature to become deafened, the duration of this metamagic effect is added to the duration of the spell.

For example, having a crowbar would be DC 12, whereas a flask of acid would be DC 20. The item must be something you can easily carry&mdash;if you are on foot and have only a backpack, for example, you could not have a large iron cauldron. You cannot have magical items using this feat, nor can you have specific items, such as the key to a particular door.
