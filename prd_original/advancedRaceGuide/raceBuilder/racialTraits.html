<h2 id="weakness-racial-traits">Weakness Racial Traits</h2>
<p>The following racial traits apply weaknesses to members of the race. All weakness racial traits cost negative RP, which means they subtract from a race's total RP spent for the purposes of meeting the race's power level restrictions. </p>

Each such increase grants an additional +4 racial bonus to CMD against trip attempts, but no other bonus. </p>

<h2 id="quadrupeds-and-magic-item-slots">Quadrupeds and Magic Item Slots</h2>
<p>Creating a race with more than two legs adversely affects that race's ability to use standard feet slot magic items. The best way to deal with this is to create variant magic item versions of the various boots, shoes, and slippers that can be worn by this race. Allow members of these races to find <i>ankle bracelets of <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/magicItems/weapons.html#_weapons-speed" >speed</a></i> or <i>horseshoes of <a href="/pathfinderRPG/prd/spells/spiderClimb.html#_spider-climb" >spider climb</a></i> that act just like their traditional magic item counterparts, but fit the new race's form.</p>
